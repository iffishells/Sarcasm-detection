0,notsarc,"If that's true, then Freedom of Speech is doomed. Harassment is subjective. Now I can claim that a book I don't like is harassing me, and it will be banned."
1,notsarc,Neener neener - is it time to go in from the playground yet?
2,notsarc,"Just like the plastic gun fear, the armour piercing bullet fear was built upon misinformation and myth."
3,notsarc,So geology is a religion because we weren't here to see rock X formed?
4,notsarc,Well done Monty. Mark that up as your first ever 100% honest and accurate post here.
5,notsarc,"But the whole process was done in the courts using the process set up by the constitution. Where the laws are not clear on an issue, such as in Massachusetts, it is the courts job to decide. The courts are a check on the injustice towards minorities by the majority."
6,notsarc,so we would penalize financially those who want to have kids?
7,notsarc,"So, IOW, you are saying that those of us who are intelligent enough to realize that your non existent imaginary god doesn't exist have a chemical imbalance? Wow, that's quite a stretch even for you Archie baby."
8,notsarc,"your probably referring to the mexican basin crater. mass extinction doesn't prove evolution. the flood as described in the Bible is an example of mass extinction. besides, in order for the asteroid theory to work, the asteroid would have to create an almost global tidal wave that would effectively kill the animals by drowning. also similiar to the effects of the flood."
9,notsarc,"Not in matters of atheism. Tell me, when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of Darwin, are the writings of Darwin disregarded? Or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses?"
10,notsarc,So will they be in front of or behind a leaf?
11,notsarc,Really? I don't think you know what you are talking about. Please provide evidence to back your claim. Thanks.
12,notsarc,"If that is a human being, then is my kidney a human being too?"
13,notsarc,That would be more likely than finding evidence for abiogenesis.
14,notsarc,What is incredible is that this is probably the most enlightened response I can expect from this crowd.
15,notsarc,"Wonder what ""euthanization"" is. Never heard of it before, and neither has the dictionary."
16,notsarc,You were crowing a bit. What I don't understand is why. How could you possibly be pleased by some strangers religious views. Would you have been pleased if he switched to liking broccoli? (Or disliking as the case may be)
17,notsarc,Oh joy another drive by with absolutely no proof or evidence.
18,notsarc,It is clear that the profetallifers wish to make the pregnant woman a slave to her fetus.
19,notsarc,"Well if your claim is that you shouldn't push a gun owner's buttons and make them mad, then why are you arguing with me when that's what you're claiming is the wrong thing to do?"
20,notsarc,"Ok...many many people have been killed in Africa because of the policies of the countries in the EU, South America, Asia, and so on....this hypocrisy annoys me."
21,notsarc,And I see you still flip back and fourth from being an atheist to not being an atheist.
22,notsarc,"What quaint illogic. Only people who marry can get divorced, so a reduction in people marrying has no effect on rising divorce rates. If anything, a rising divorce rate among fewer marriages points to an even higher divorce rate than ""normal""."
23,notsarc,"I agree, for the most part. Once you get to tanks and helicopters though? Too big, too easy a target for a tyrannical regime. Do you see the Iraqis and Afghanis using tanks and helicopters? I'm sure they could get them if they really wanted, but they're useless against a government that invests in satellite technology and bombers. Better to stick with the rocket launchers and mines."
24,notsarc,"Really, so you are totally knowable? Show me the site that has the Mach User-Manual where I can know everything about you."
25,notsarc,"I don't see anyone without healthcare. None of my friends, none of my family, none of my neighbors. ZILCH. NADA. NAUGHT. CIPHER.   Now I don't go wandering around the inner cities looking for half-crazy winos and crack addicts either, so maybe that's why."
26,notsarc,"It seems that the high priest of Global Warming is so unconcerned about its reality that In the past year, Gore's home burned through 213,210 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity, enough to power 232 average American households for a month.   http://news.newsmax.com/?SKIDYNyQ-GW...mo_code=6539-1"
27,notsarc,Then why can't you explain an unreflective fertility and abortion rates between 1972-1979 here in America or how the Polish fertility rate never increased after the 1993 referendum that criminalized abortion?   Prove to me when criminalizing abortion has ever decreased it's demand. So far you haven'tonly provided empty rhetoric. The pro-life movement thoroughly brainwashes it's supporters to believe such jibberish.
28,notsarc,Proof? All I can think to say is that a mind is a terrible thing to waste.
29,notsarc,"False. This is not a valid definition of atheism. Atheism is the lack of theism (the belief in gods). Certainly, if I said ""there isn't a tiger in my bathroom"", I wouldn't need to have a camera in there to see. It's called being reasonable."
30,notsarc,O they don't make space anymore. They'll just put him in a cell with pot growers and crack addicts. He'll be lucky if he gets a spot on the floor to sleep on.
31,notsarc,"I think the FSM threw these guys a bone. They cherrypicked which taxa would give them the most statistically significant results. If they were to expand the method to include more and more taxa, they'd see the Noodly Appendage of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. Ramen."
32,notsarc,"I take it you have no understanding of science, much less the scientific method?"
33,notsarc,"Well maybe on the 4473 they could put a little box to check if you are a straw purchaser,maybe a psychic in the back room or ask them politely if they are straw purchasers."
34,notsarc,"Just another example of using a verse meant for personal use and applying it to wars. Sorry, just doesn't work that way."
35,notsarc,"I think he doesn't really know what he means, I don't think all heathens follow a particular set of beliefs, though I don't know as many as I do pagans."
36,notsarc,"By all means, burn those books . . . er, I mean, take down those nativity scenes."
37,notsarc,"""Supposedly""? You ran from those threads. You are the one making assertions that you don't back up. You are the one unwilling (i.e. unable) to show that Arctic foxes can adapt to a Phoenix summer. You are the one who keeps ignoring (what I will henceforth refer to as) The Chihuahua Challenge. For somebody claiming to be so clearly right and so obviously vindicated by the evidence, you've done nothing to show it, and you've done everything to run from it."
38,notsarc,"Oh? They're trained to deal with irate exhusbands who are stabbing their wives and dousing them in gasoline, in broad daylight, in the middle of a busy parking lot? They're trained to deal with that specific kind of #### every single day?"
39,notsarc,And a lot of blacks were killed through hangings. Are you against rope vendors?
40,notsarc,And instead place my faith in the mythology of nomadic herdsmen? It is much more logical to believe in some all knowing but unknowable magic being who poofed everything into existance and then created all of the evidence to make it appear as if he didn't.
41,notsarc,and gun nuts say f*** the children when we have to decide between saving guns and childrens lives
42,notsarc,"well, whatever the case may be, that baby has a full function nervous system and can feel the pain whenever it is aborted. Does that not disturb you? People always tend to think ""oh the mother is going to go through pain"" BLA BLA BLA.. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BABY THAT IS BEING TORTURED TO DEATH? cmon."
43,notsarc,So what? The fact remains that Britain is still four times as dangerous as America in terms in crime rates. Or are you arguing that their crime level is acceptable and that you're alright with so many more people being a helpless victim unable to do anything?
44,notsarc,"Nonsense. Name the holes and what parts are conjecture? The parts that are conjecture are never, ever taught in a high school biology class. There isn't time. Only major points are covered about which there is no doubt."
45,notsarc,Now everyone will know Marc was right all along--that there is an atheist science conspiracy.
46,notsarc,"Well, I've personally measured the gravitational pull of a ball of lead about 5cm in diameter. Are you suggesting that angels push the planets around? That was the leading theory before Newton."
47,notsarc,"Then 99% of creationists are not informed as far as I can tell. It seems that your position is that ""informed"" creationists are neo-Darwinists, fully accepting of the theories of evolution."
48,notsarc,"Oh, so business owners don't make ""real"" contributions to society?"
49,notsarc,It's truly amazing that even someone like KH can disprove evolution so quickly.
50,notsarc,So you still choose to believe that someone who's a victim of crime should be punished as if they committed the crime themselves?
51,notsarc,"Many natural disasters such as tornados, destructive flood, severe drought probably have something to do with global warming.I don't know which is first regarding these combinations. Maybe flood is caused due to global warming, maybe reverse.These phenomena are related each other, so it can't be seperated when we think about it.Maybe global warming itself is not such a big threat but many disadvantages resulting from this are threats to us."
52,notsarc,"Biologically speaking, the fetus is human; the mother person is simply sustaining it via blood-- just like via mother's milk after birth. Can she legally starve the newborn child of that (if no other suitable nourishment is available) simply because she has the ""right to her body?""I think no, by law."
53,notsarc,And yet all you do is present your own opinions without supporting facts. 
54,notsarc,"I'm sure the racist white segregationists after Plessey thought exactly as you do now, ""That settles the matter.""Little Louise Brown had a big SURPRISE!!! for them.You still have not walked upon the thin ice of the ""well regulated"" wording, we note."
55,notsarc,"oh don't kid yourself, you people were miserable long before I got here. Darwinists' arrogance is astounding."
56,notsarc,"Exactly. Most people would incorporate it, from childhood most often. Steeeeve can't seem to wrap his mind around that."
57,notsarc,"Actually, everything the bible say's belies your ""atheist answer"". The reality is that the world itself and all of Gods Creation speaks to His existence as being self evident. It takes a degree of faith to accept Jesus as our personal Savior, but as far as accepting the reality of God Himself, all one need do is look observe the world we live in to see that only an incredible and loving God could create such a Beautiful and marvelous World with so many amazing symbiotic and perfectly interdependent forms of life."
58,notsarc,"Actually ""I don't know"" is quite a valid answer in science.However, again you slip into this false construct of a belief that all that can be known is in the scope of science; which you've also denied saying you believe in the past.[quote=Montalban]Is this a rational statement? If so, prove it rationally, by science. "
59,notsarc,"Well, let's be honest here. People fear gay marriage, not that it might come about via judicial fiat. That's just the current whipping horse because that's how it happened first, for some broad values of judicial fiat of course. There was a recent post here about rights granted gays by their state legislature, Oregon I think, and a group jumped in and forced the law on hold via a petition drive. So it really isn't the means by which gays get equality that upsets some folks, it's the equality itself. ""judicial fiat"" is just a phrase people can use so they can avoid stating their true motives, preventing gays from being treated as equals."
60,notsarc,"Yes, it does. But determining that age is not a question answered by evolution."
61,notsarc,"?? What are you trying to say?Science is knowledge, all knowledge, that is, anything we find to be true. There is no other ""truth"" out there, if there were, we'd be omniscient."
62,notsarc,"Now, now ZSU, we learned from comrade star gazer that GW created the Continental Army. I am sure these gentlemen have some equally illogical and inaccurate 'facts' to scatter around the barnyard emoticonXHoho"
63,notsarc,"YES! the founding fathers realized government was to serve the people it governed. With out a set of rules that limited the government it would run wild (as england did). They made the bill of rights and constitution so that it would limit the government (to keep it from becoming too powerful, and overstepping it's bounds). And the only way the constitution could actually be enforced was for the population to uphold it.Back in the time of it's writing they probably saw the best way for a population to force a government to not over step it's bounds was to force it... er... by force.Today in the information age, a much better weapon is our right to vote. Sweeping changes can be implemented with out the use of force using the system. "
64,notsarc,"There are several scientific explanations for the nature of the earth. Some use 'science' to say that the world is flat. Granted that these beliefs aren't widely accepted, but then not all religions are widely accepted. By your reasoning or 'logic' you must ask yourself about whether you should rely on science when there are many different scientific theories.The Flat Earth News, at least back then, had a regular column, ""One Hundred Proofs Earth is Not a Globe.""(go to http://www.flat-earth.org/)Other theories taught as sciencephrenologyalchemyevolutioneugenicsneptunismTheories of the Aether Articles relating to the Emergence of Scientific Theories of the Cosmic Aether(http://www.mountainman.com.au/aether.html)What about 'metascience'?http://www.calresco.org/lucas/science.htmOr, sciences used to support political ends...What about Marxist Sciencehttp://www.marxists.org/archive/hald...philosophy.htmor Chaos Theory and Marxismhttp://www.marxist.com/science/chaostheory.htmlThere's Nazi Sciencehttp://www.webster.edu/~woolflm/naziscience.htmlNationalist Sciencehttp://www.ljudmila.org/nettime/zkp4/08.htmOr social ends...Scientific Racismhttp://www.press.uillinois.edu/f02/tucker.htmlMainstream scientists instead of using the word 'heretic' use the word 'pseudo-science' to categorise fringe beliefs."
65,notsarc,"None of the 'fishersci' links would take, but I did get a look at the fibre optic systems. Will try again later."
66,notsarc,"Actually, I reported the real results of a study. Regular church attendees are twice as likely to vote Republican...etc., the conclusion was, however, meant to be a joke. Most got it, you didn't. emoticonXRolleyes"
67,notsarc,"You mean that it must have has a beginning, don't you?"
68,notsarc,"I'm sorry, but your entire rant is nothing but ignorance based fear mongering. From YOUR ARTICLE:"
69,notsarc,"Actually I'm so sure of my manhood that even though I knew that charge would be levelled against me I still posted anyway. Anyway if you feel that men need to be degraded to make up for past actions to women you have gone from ""righteous"" to bitter."
70,notsarc,No. We know that evolution happens. What would be a problem would be to find the processes that made evolution happen as such incredible rates. There isn't any evidence that it can happen that fast.
71,notsarc,"No, not really. All that is different is the number of steps.
 
 What is YOUR definition of 'macro-evoution'? Is it speciation? Or is it a brand new genus?
 
 We have observed speciation, where new species happened."
72,notsarc,"Logical truths do not come from ""somewhere"", your question makes as much sense as ""What time is a moose?"".You do not appear to have read my post at all, variously repeating what I have said and addressing things I did not say."
73,notsarc,"Not really when you consider the gun laws of the UK, and how they were changed to prevent incidents like Cumbria from ever happening."
74,notsarc,"So, you're saying that you believe in absolutely everything your church believes and you support everything it does and the moment it did anything oustide of these you'd leave right?"
75,notsarc,"Perhaps an analogy. Lets say for the sake of the argument you do not smoke or drink (personally against it, for whatever reason). However, you believe others should have the right to drink and smoke if they so choose. So, you are personally against drinking and smoking but you are ""pro-choice"" in that regard (meaning you believe every person should make that determination for themselves).Pro-life would be: You don't drink and smoke (morally against it perhaps) and you are going to make sure that no one else is able to either."
76,notsarc,"Quite frankly, you don't know squat about me. So stop trying to pretend you do.I have gone on record to say I think Christianity does a lot of good in the world.I have even tried to correct Matthew in his anti-Christian tirades. (Until I gave up realizing it would do no good... emoticonXFrazzled )I hate to break it to you, but the WORLD typically functions with people putting out negative news.You hear about how Joe XXXX broke the law.Do you ever hear about how Johnny Atlas keeps the law?emoticonXFrazzled"
77,notsarc,Do you think humans have the pinnacle of processing power and reason in our brain for the entire universe? (aside from god)
78,notsarc,"That's not true -- actually, it doesn't make sense. Science is just a bunch of rules (by definition). ""Biology uses science to study life"" is true. ""Physics uses science to study the physical world"" is true, but ""science's purpose is to study life"" is not true. "
79,notsarc,"No, genesis is not a history lesson. It is a combination of 'just so' stories, and a religious message in allegory format. If you bothered to learn understand some of the hebrew puns behind many of the words, and also see the political commentary of events that were happening during the time it was written, that would be obvious."
80,notsarc,"actually, it can be proven whether leprechauns, unicorns, the flying spaghetti monster, magical space monkeys and livining care baers, and even god, exists or not.the question of proving a belief seems kinda self-contradictory to me. if something is a fact that can be proven, then your belief about it is irrelevant. likewise, if you believe something, whether there are facts to support it or not, its still your belief. there are people who believe things inn the absence of supporting facts, and sometimes even in the face of opposing facts. the term for that is faithfaith is the belief of something in the absence of evidence. if you have faith in something, proof is irrelevant, or at least it should be"
81,notsarc,"I'm not sure what you are saying. Are you saying that you think that theropod dinosaurs should have more feathers than this Sinornithosaurus does? First you claim that the entire forelimb would have been useless, and when shown that it was not you claim that the feathers could not have existed because they would be useless, and now when shown a fossil that shows feathers, you are surprised that there are not more.I suspect that not all of the feathers on this creature are apparent in the fossil.http://research.amnh.org/vertpaleo/feather5.jpg http://research.amnh.org/vertpaleo/feather9a.jpg http://research.amnh.org/vertpaleo/feather11.jpg But there are enough to show that feathered dinosaurs did, in fact exist. Any argument about whether or not is is possible that such creatures existed is moot. It is irrelevant that you feel that such limbs would have been useless. Obviously they were not.So now we return to your original confused and erroneous arguments."
82,notsarc,"That is the declaration of independence not the constitution.I can go you one better admendment 9 and 10 talk about certain rights retained by the people.Amendment IXThe enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. Amendment XThe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.The conservatives would argue that by offering same sex marriage that their persute of happiness is denied by gay people even existing and that they have to look at us."
83,notsarc,"Right. That certainly explains the many, many versions of Christianity."
84,notsarc,"The claim that only through a belief in the Biblical God - or any God - can right and wrong be known is completely stupid. 1) Ever hear of humanism? 2) EVEN CHIMPS HAVE A SENSE OF BEING TREATED RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY! AND EVEN CHIMPS HAVE BEEN SEEN TO DO FOR OTHERS WHAT THEY WOULD WANT DONE FOR THEM!EDIT: Excuse, I double checked and I was wrong ... but that's BAD news for the Creationist!EVEN CAPUCHIN MONKEYS - WHICH ARE NOT AS RELATED TO HUMANS AS ARE CHIMPS - HAVE A SENSE OF WHETHER THEY ARE BEING TREATED FAIRLY OR NOT!!!http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases...0918092951.htmChimps take this one step farther by adding into the mix how closely their social bonds are to the other participant. So chimps have a more complex sense of fairness than do capuchin monkeys.http://www.whsc.emory.edu/press_rele...nt_id_seq=2819"
85,notsarc,"Leaving aside for a moment the false construct you're arguing against you should read up...The Pseudo-Problem of Creation in Physical Cosmology by Adolf Grnbaumhttp://www.infidels.org/library/mode...m/problem.html"" As Bondi sees it, the steady-state theory propounded by himself and Thomas Gold in 1948 brings ""the problem of creation . . . within the scope of physical inquiry"" (Ibid.)Although some theories are deemed defunct, such as the one above, your assumptions about such things being outside the scope of science is flawed."
86,notsarc,"Not really. That's the fallacy of exclusion of the middle. Because there are only two choices, if one is wrong somehow, the other is therefore correct. The problem is that there isn't only two choice for sure. Besides, science is wrong all the time, it doesn't prove that creation is right. In fact, for instance, science estaimtes of moon dust have been proven wildly wrong, and those corrections actually harm creation. "
87,notsarc,But that doesn't help much with calculating the length of a day from actual astronomical observations. Perhaps if we told Freeofthought that the current rate of slowing of the earth is 0.005 sec/year/year. I have no doubt that Freeofthought will misunderstand that number - it is a rate. Just assume that rate has been unchanging even though it hasn't been.A lot of the creationists misunderstanding comes from remarks like the following.
88,notsarc,Not the way I see it from my experiences. I let the readers decide on their own. 
89,notsarc,"The interesting thing about the 'quality of life ethic' is that, in a pro-choice framework, it means that we can't degrade anyone's quality of life without their permission. So far from entailing a cull of the elderly, the infirm, the handicapped, and the ugly, the quality of life ethic entails that we cannot kill them off. Each person is entitled to the quality of life that they desire where what they desire does not infringe on other's quality of life. "
90,notsarc,"You know, that is one aspect of the story that no one ever seems to focus on when refuting the flood. I think it is an excellent extra point of refutation of the whole ridiculous story."
91,notsarc,So?I look into the clouds and see a cow. Clouds aren't telling me to have a steak.
92,notsarc,"Right on! A real man supports those he loves, through thick and thin. He doesn't try and control the things he can't either.In the end, it's not a man's decision. It is not his body, therefore, he has no right to make the ultimate decision. He can only express his view. That's about it. (I'm pretty sure it's not any easier for her to decide). So cudos to those men."
93,notsarc,"Only approximate and really depends upon what day you start counting, before or after menses."
94,notsarc,Actually Archie it was neither left nor right. he went after both democrat and republican and took a center tone to the entire issue at hand. Portraying the reality of the suffering of his hometown due to jobs leaving the US and the greed on wall street.
95,notsarc,In your first post. If you are to qualify that by stating I assert that reproduction is not an absolute requirement of life over the ontogeny of an individual then of course reproduction is not essential character of life.
96,notsarc,Let me explain this to you.You want to stop abortions for someone else. You want to take a womans right to choose away. Where as Jito supporting a womans right to choose does not impose upon your life in any way.You want to stop me from being able to marry this does not effect your life in any way yet has a devastationg effect on my life. The left supports rights while your side want to limit the rights of others.You want to stop me from being able to marry because you have a religious belief against it even though I may have a religious belief that supports it. Therefore you are imposing your religious and moral views on me when I do not share those beliefs.
97,notsarc,"I think that we've got to draw a line at some point, to demarcate between adult and child. Where ever we do draw it, it will seem, in some situations to be arbitrary. If we made it 20, the question would be why 20 year olds and not 19. Through the years society has determined that by 18 people should have attained enough life experience to form intent and to comprehend that their actions have consequences (at least as it applies to the death penalty, they can be tried as adults w/o death). We don't execute people who can't comprehend the nature of their crimes and society says that, under 18 you can't fully comprehend criminal actions."
98,notsarc,"So have I, since I know that evolution has and does take place. But I catch it from both sides because I don't believe the scientific explanation of the origins of life or the beginning of intelligent awareness."
99,notsarc,"So police who are not military and are civilians, unless you are paid by the DOD and come under the geneva Convention you are a civilian period. If you had of paid attention, you should know that it is not the ""standing army"" that is fighting the current wars, it is oath taking militia/civilians from the State National Guards and reserve forces who have taken the same oath many of us have, to protect the Constitution from all enemies both domestic and foreign. That is not to say that only those people are the militia either!Can you name one successful government that has ever won a guerrilla war? Russia fought in Afghanistan for how long before it limped back home?"
100,notsarc,Crime has dropped significantly in New York and Los Angeles in recent years. 
101,notsarc,Since they are issued by the military I would think so. 
102,notsarc,So I am not intitled to my opinions? Your statement is so ironic because it seems that others also suffer from pot and kettleism and don't realize it.
103,notsarc,"Just as you were stating that it was not as an example, so was I stating that it was to me as an example. So, your reasoning that we can know if it is or is not a person is because people disagree on whether or not it is? That theory could use a bit more explanation."
104,notsarc,Oh never mind that such a condition would be toxic...not to mention that no ice cores support such magical ideas.
105,notsarc,"You do not have a right to drive. No one does. Driving is not a right. The state does not owe it to you to give you a license to drive. The activity of driving is a priveldge granted by the state, not a right.Rights are not regulated by government. You have them and no earthly authority can take it away from you. The state never gave me my rights, I already had them, nor do I have to ask for permission to exercise them."
106,notsarc,And there are plenty of people who smoke who don't develop lung cancer. You're cherry picking.
107,notsarc,"this statement isn't logical.It does not follow that if the person who creates the laws has to therefore follow them or can't change them...or even that they apply to him. If a teacher says ""no talking in the classroom"" it doesn't apply to the teacher now does it."
108,notsarc,"There's no adding of firearms going on, because they're already there! The criminals have them, that's a hard fact of life that can't ever be changed. Deal with it. What we want is for the intended victims to be on equal footing with the bad guys. There's nothing unreasonable about that."
109,notsarc,"Many of the gun hating crowd also own guns. It's the elitism belief, that they're superior to all humans and thus deserve to be armed, while everyone else in the world should be unarmed and bow before them as if they're gods."
110,notsarc,I'm glad you made the same correlation I did. ToE is a substitute for #### in this case.
111,notsarc,"You have ignored a third option, my denier of all that is right and good. That third option is the one you atheists and secular humanists refuse to consider, and that is that God spoke the stars into creation at the same time as Genesis says He spoke everything into existence in 6 days time as Genesis declares. What is dishonest and deceptive about your position is to then extrapolate from that info that it is God who is being deceptive. It is like saying that because you reject the gospel of Jesus as I accurately and honestly share it with you, that it is me lying about that gospel because you have rejected it. It is the most irrational and dishonest reasoning possible, yet it defines the way your minds work. emoticonXDonno"
112,notsarc,"So essentially the good thing about religion is that it poses a question that may or may not be completely meaningless and then invents a happy-making answer to satisfy the curiosity thus engendered? Wow, that's so much more profound than eradicating smallpox."
113,notsarc,"And I think that if I fall off a tall cliff, I'll die. Does that mean that gravity and science are either evil or incorrect?"
114,notsarc,"So country by country, the world is going to hell in a hand basket. And this pleases you, why? emoticonXFrazzled"
115,notsarc,"In what universe is there a right to murder?Unfortunately, we in the United States have only recently recognized that abusing children and owning slaves is not a right.And, only recently have women enjoyed the right to vote in the United States.What certain activities are forbidden in public?Some of the conservative red states have only recently decreed that there should be speek limits. Not for safety reasons, of course.And, George Walker Bush has guaranteed the right of corporations to dump dangerous chemicals into lakes and rivers and the oceans."
116,notsarc,"And statistically a school massacre by someone with a concealed carry permit is just short of being nonexistent, but that fact still doesn't mean a thing to you."
117,notsarc,"And justifiably. If you don't see the problem, then you are the problem. The proposed revisions is typical YEC banter about ""evolution is a theory"" - without making it clear what a theory is. ""Teach all sides of the question."" That's code for teaching ""creation theory"" or ID. Does that mean that in geography class the teachers should present a flat earth as a reasonable alternative? How about the earth as the center of the universe? No? I am all for teaching well supported theories that are not in agreement with the mainstream, but ID or creationism aren't them."
118,notsarc,"From a book review of BETTER FOR ALL THE WORLD: The Secret History of Forced Sterilization and America's Quest for Racial Purity by Harry Bruinius:http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/bo...w/26satel.htmlHmmm, Teddy Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, the Rockefeller foundations, millions of Americans, the State of Indiana. . . all these embraced the concept of EUGENICS.Interesting, yes?"
119,notsarc,If you truly believe this then I think you need to re-read your posts and put yourself in the shoes of those on the receiving end. 
120,notsarc,"Depends on which cell you mean. Mammalian red blood cells, for example, have had their entire nuclei and mitochondria removed. Not so much as a smidgeon of DNA."
121,notsarc,"No it's not. Wouldn't it be nice if you knew enough to differentiate between theory, evidence and definition.[/quote]Ha! Now, however, genes are ""losing their glitter.""[/quote]I wasn't aware that they glittered. What are you talking about?"
122,notsarc,"So, you got your tubes tied because ""With womens right's getting shredded in the debate over abortion, fewer and fewer women are going to want to even risk have sex with men at all. It'll cause a wave of abstinence and imprisonment that will cut succesive generations in half. That'll even further errode the solvancy of social security."" Why would one get their tubes tied if they were swearing off men? emoticonXConfused And do you really believe the rest of the load about imprisonment and SS solvancy erosion, too? emoticonXRolleyes"
123,notsarc,"So if an atheist believes that humans are the highest form of intelligence, and a devout Christian believes God is the highest form of intelligence, the Christian should allow the atheist to force him to behave as if humans are the highest form of intelligence?"
124,notsarc,"Well for what it's worth, the police prefer to use AR-15 Carbines, MP-5 9mms, and either Mossberg or Remington 12ga when they are serving a no-knock warrant on your house (or the wrong house next door) in the middle of then night. And the AK may be a bit much for home use, as the 7.62 would way over-penetrate the walls and hit the neighbors houses (or the neighbors.) Hope that helped."
125,notsarc,"I think I posted that awhile ago. Its huge BS. Thats like saying ""Civil rights hurt blacks"". Even though abortion may have some unwated side affects, its no where near the emotional and physical pain and suffering for the rest of your life than a forced pregnancy. Just goes to show that the pro-life movement is desperate."
126,notsarc,"but they do support the choice to abort a fetus or embryo. An argument made for slavery was that ""you don't have to own them but don't tell us what to do""..a fairly similar argument but doesn't show whether or not abortion is wrong just that some lines of thinking should be questioned."
127,notsarc,"You know something is wrong with this world when people start calling embryos and non-sentient life forms victims and referring to martin Luther King Jr. to justify their views. It seems today that anyone that shows any decency or slight intelligence or common sense is labeled a radical leftist. Man, the republicans are getting desperate when you see them trying to equate embryos to men using MLK."
128,notsarc,But doesn't Genesis imply that creation occured in one 7-day period (though the days could be symbollic)?
129,notsarc,"I think a free society works better by saying ""You have to have at least a certain variety to give your customers a choice in products"". Businesses should have the restrictions, not private citizens."
130,notsarc,"Well I think that god must be a bit confused since he also says....Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.  Numbers 31:17-18He doesn't seem to mind at least some retroactive abortions...."
131,notsarc,"A master baiter like you should present your thesis to be taken seriously, you haven't and you aren't. "
132,notsarc,"So what is your point? Are you claiming that the tenets of christianity are in doubt because the several thousand denominations hold contradictory views? Science proceeds by challenges and contradictions. Contradiction in science is not evidence of doubt but evidence of a field of advance. In religion, it is without question, a matter of the veracity of the ultimate truth. Which of the thousands of christian faiths hold the truth?"
133,notsarc,"First off, define ""government funded"". The FBI? The CIA? Other federal law enforcement agencies? The military? All vital government entities that are and should be armed. The fact that governments around the world have killed their own citizens after disarming them does not mean that they should not be armed, it means that the citizens should not be disarmed. Think of what our country would have become over the last 100 years without an armed government."
134,notsarc,"There is a point, however, that the fetal lung is not mature enough to survive outside the womb even with mechanical assistance. So, unless our technology will be pretty radically different in the future, it isn't about getting it out, it's about it not surviving when it is out."
135,notsarc,"No, neither am I suggesting that illegality makes something immoral. Legality and morality are completely separate things."
136,notsarc,"Actually, you have slipped into talking Bible here and seem to be refering to the miracle of Lazarus."
137,notsarc,I believe I would know when my own post is sarcasm or not...
138,notsarc,I'll take these questions (one at a time) in the other thread.
139,notsarc,"It's ashame that everyone keeps looking for the judiciary to do the legislature's work. When will the people press Congress to take up abortion? It is the job of Congress after all, to address the issues desired by it's constituents."
140,notsarc,"You still haven't learned what Google is have you Yankee Fan?HowStuffWorks ""Artificial Life""Artificial Life Likely in 3 to 10 Years - Science - redOrbitAnd relying entirely on insults is not a good way of gaining credibility. It didn't work on Livewire, it won't work here. "
141,notsarc,"In the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson identifies the right to life as a fundamental freedom. If more gun-control saves lives then more gun-control means more freedom. Aren't you pro-gunners interested in freedom?"
142,notsarc,"Well, if Genesis was in fact true, then we would have to assume that God is real and the Bible more or less explains what he wants, right? And if there is someone ""up there"" who will damn you to eternal torment if you don't do what he wants (which is one interpretation of the Bible) than that might effect the way you act. I realize that that isn't exactly the same as changing your moral compass, but history has demonstrated that most people's moral will stretch to accomodate pressing needs, and I think an actual vengeful diety would qualify."
143,notsarc,"Doesn't that explain why manslaughter is like miscarriage, rather than why it is different?And Clerisian, you didn't seem to be arguing that the two were distinct, rather you appeared to say that pro-lifers did support charging mothers who miscarried with manslaughter (where the mother's actions, say, drinking heavily, were the cause of death)."
144,notsarc,He only understands natural selection when he belives that it goes against what is accepted by scientists.
145,notsarc,"I agreew with you in principle. However, I see too many flaws in our justice system to make it useful at this point."
146,notsarc,"No it isn't. There was an incident here in the states last year that had an elderly woman beaten and raped, and several days later her rapist came back to do it again and she killed him on the spot. She wasn't brought to court to face trial even know she killed someone.THAT is how something like this should be handled."
147,notsarc,"As an aside I do admire your way with words, bravo!"
148,notsarc,"And here you reveal your prediliction for reading what you want to see into the words of others. I described materialism embracing new forces and phenomena which have withstood the rigors of the scientific method. I explicitly described science as a methodology, not a philosophy. You are wrong about me, WW, and the longer you pretend otherwise, the more time you're going to waste on strawmen and the more chances I'm going to get to make your arguments look silly. It's up to you. Argue with me, or argue with the person you want me to be."
149,notsarc,"Actually it should be easily to relate to VOR on this: he only argues with emotion. No facts, no evidence, no proof, just emotion."
150,notsarc,"Well then quit trolling, and start debunking the BS by providing links to cases that were solved by having a gun registry in place."
151,notsarc,"And the other website says they are working on ""over unity"" machines. :)You know, perpetual motion. :)http://www.earthtech.org/about/index.html"
152,notsarc,"Actually the benefits of stable, safe and loving homes for chilren are important to society. To deny gays and lesbians are indeed able to provide this is a flat out lie. I have directed you to the AAP report on gay parenting. I would suggest you actually read it. "
153,notsarc,"I think we are all aware that abortion is a terrible thing. No-one is denying that. And contrary to what some people might think, there is nothing anyone could say to make (most) women undergoing an abortion feel any worse about it. Just like any traumatic situation, sometimes you might just need to talk to someone about it, make sure your head is in the right place. And yes, some abortion clinics do provide counseling, but as far as i know, all of them provide referrals to other organizations that do. Contrary to what some people might think, the employees at these clinics, for the most part, are caring, compassionate people."
154,notsarc,"Just making sure that everybody is aware of his evasion, misrepresentation, and dishonesty. I figured a good time to do that would be while he was accusing scientists of these things... (I figure it's a damn good illustration when a paper's author tells him to stop misrepresenting the paper, and he keeps doing it anyway.)In fairness, being a creationist isn't necessarily an indicator of dishonesty; there are plenty of creationists who are creationists simply because they are uneducated about the subject. Unfortunately, supersport isn't part of this group; he has seen the evidence and is willfully ignorant of it."
155,notsarc,"I don't see how this is not a debate about abortion. True, it's become mildly less concrete, but that's what happens when you try to get it right."
156,notsarc,"Sorry to inform you, but until you are 18 years old in this country, you are not granted full protection of your rights under the constitution of the united states. I don't agree with testing either, but saying that it violates your rights is not a valid argument. "
157,notsarc,"Well then what the devil are you moaning about then? It's not like Browning shot King, or actually made the rifle that was used or anything like that. Hell it wasn't even a rifle made by the Browning company.There's absolutely no connection between the two for you to be bitching about."
158,notsarc,"It won't. I'd think any responsible parent with a teen under the age of 18 who has a sound relationship with that teen would discuss the possibility of her becoming sexually active (a normal function in spite of some puritan attitudes) and offer simple avoidance of possible pregnancy and abortion. Like vehicle insurance she may never need it, but going without either one is plain stupid."
159,notsarc,"No Peeling, it would be, ""We proved it was possible to evolve as humans have, so why can only we do it?"" Why hasn't one other creature on Earth ever evolved to our level of sophistication in the same alleged 4 billion years that we have had to attain our level of evolution? If evo is real, then it seems only right that it should touch all species equally and that all species that weren't forced into extinction, but survived and overcame the pressures they faced should have ended up in a similar evolved place that man has attained in 4 billion years.Unless of course that the science of evolution is a humanistic justification to explain our origins but has no basis in fact what so ever. And that is my claim and belief."
160,notsarc,You offer no positive evidence towards Creationism nor did you deny that the idea of Creationism as scientific was destroyed long ago.
161,notsarc,"So what?? Who cares what the number of assumptions are? What we care about is whether the idea is correct. And to determine whether it is correct, you have to have data, not counting assumptions."
162,notsarc,They don't live in an environment where such events are likely. At one time there were several species of hominini living at the same time. Evolution is more bushlike that ladder like. It just so happens that we are the only species that remains.
163,notsarc,"No, it doesn't. It is an example of how one part of the theory of evolution works to effect changes in a population."
164,notsarc,"Max has outed himself as a hillbilly who cannot spell or incorporate correct punctuation.I wonder if this effects his ability to know what evidence is ?Apparently so since he believes man evolved.""attacking in"" LOL !Ray M."
165,notsarc,"So God gets to do these terrible things, but He gets a free pass because He's God?Kinda funny what happens when you show Archie that the Bible doesn't even support his beliefs, isn't it guys?I still like the fact that the Bible says not to count children under one month of age as persons, yet here Archie expects us to count a zygote as ""a human life."""
166,notsarc,"No, not in the least. It's real intent was to throw a bone to the people pretending to have ""family values"". The religious right, the conservatives, that lot."
167,notsarc,I don't see why it is so hard to accept he lied. He lost is award and lost his job over his data.
168,notsarc,"Really? A human can be determined scientifically. Personhood is a human legal construct. You cannot prove scientifically what a ""person"" is."
169,notsarc,"If the child is to be born into a poverty stricken part of the world and is expected to die by the age of 7 by either disease or lack of food, why not spare pain and abort?"
170,notsarc,"Source: FindLaw | Cases and CodesMost of your comments follow some form of dishonesty (i.e. misrepresentation, strawman arguments, flat out lies, pretending not to understand or be aware of rebuttals or unfavorable evidence) or just poor logic (spin, rhetoric, talking points and analogies)."
171,notsarc,"Just curious, is it beyond you to make a post that includes common sense and logic? I'm thinking it is since all of you posts seem to be based on rhetoric and emotion. Three paragraphs and all of them contain a falsehood/ lie, congrats your batting 1.000."
172,notsarc,"Today I was driving my son and two of his team-mates to basketball practice. One of the kids used the word gay in a derogatory manner. I asked him not to. My son said ""ya, my dad is gay."" No teasing, no name calling, a few curious a questions and back to basketball.My son has also been thrown to floor of the bus and force fed garbage for asking a kid to not use the word ""gay"" in a derogatory manner.Do you really think the solution is to prevent gay people from forming families so mean kids can have free reign to be little asses? Or maybe the fact that a kid has gay parents isn't the real issue.I would also like to point out that your argument fails to address the thousands of gay parents who have BIOLOGICAL children."
173,notsarc,All of the points above should be considered if you want to produce a solid argument that a series of events actually occured in the past. If you wish others to take this seriously please produce some relevant evidence from a source that held to a higher level of credibility. By your standards I should make a thread based on the National Enquirer or Star about Kerry's life as a male gigolo or golddigger.
174,notsarc,"But what would he have learned from it? If you're going to use that analogy, then lets say the last thing he remembers is walking to the bar. What would he learn or have experienced?"
175,notsarc,Actually I don't deal with spanish or french because I don't have to. I speak english. emoticonXRolleyes
176,notsarc,"Actually, we didn't. The first record of a melanic form was in 1848. Presumably other melanic individuals had appeared before this, both in Biston bebularia as well as other moths. We know that a similar mutation occucrred in other moths North America some years after the 1848 record of the B. betualria.There are actually several alleles of the gene responsible for color that form a dominence hierarchy with the fully black morph (called carbonaria) as the top dominant and the typical as recessive. The intermediate forms are referred to as insularia. They are uncommon. At any rate, by 1895, 98% of observed B. betularia in industrialized areas were carbonaria."
177,notsarc,"Listen, I have forgotten more than you will ever learn about what is real and true in this world, so either back up your insults with facts or get lost because It is becoming painfully obvious that attempting to reason with you is an exercise in futility. kind of like trying to travel from point A to point B on a merry-go-round."
178,notsarc,"Actually, you don't have to have FAITH in science.
 Good science demands you test it. Repeatedly.
 
 That vast majority of religion demands you accept it

 Yes but some people don't want to close the borders. They prefer no border controls."
180,notsarc,"Yes, homo habilus was a monkey. I've been telling people that for years."

183,notsarc,"Given that I do not hold that opinion, I would challenge you show where I have stated such."
184,notsarc,"i've no problems with gay couples marrying if they have kids
 straight couples can adopt as well"
185,notsarc,"Do you have a quote? a link? anything to make us think that you're not spinning this like you tend to spin everything else?Here's something you didn't think through: you say that ""inherent"" human dignity is a derivative of the image-of-God claim. First, that makes it most certainly not inherent but derived. Second, you insult the entire human race when you claim that human dignity is dependent upon anything else. I'm sorry that you think so little of humans."
186,notsarc,"No! At conception we are a person and human.All living things belong to a species and the foetus is a living thing, for that reason a foetus must belong to a species, and that species is human.A fingernail is dead so cannot be considered a living human, nor will it develop into a human.The sperm only has half the chromosomes so is not human.The unique human is the key element here, if you cut your nail, the DNA from the nail can be replicated by the living persons nail, a foetus when destroyed cannot have itself replicated, the unique DNA that is destroyed will never be see on earth again, that individual has gone forever, howver, the man with the nail clipped is still alive."
187,notsarc,"I think perhaps you're confused.1. I know of no meaningful definion of the term ""god' as it pertains to reality.2. When you mention science and history, that implies you are interested in reality.3. There is no evidence to support mythological deities, god or God or Odin or the easter bunny.* So, yes THERE IS NO EVIDENCE of the existence of any mytholgoical gods.** Yes, there is no evidence that the universe was created, or if that statement even has meaning if the universe always was, and always will be.p.s. There is easter bunny.-Mach"
188,notsarc,"It is 'change over time', not 'gradual change over time'. The morphological changes tend to happen with a change in the environment. The difference between 'micro' evolution and 'macro' evolution is the number of steps. ""Macro"" evolution is a bunch of 'micro' evoltultions that add up. You have two populations that you can compare that used to interbreed, and for some reason, do not, and then you add on a few 1000 'mircro-evolution' events to each, they become very very different."
189,notsarc,"The idea of abortion as population control is absurd, especially forced abortions as someone mentioned a few posts ago. Anyone who has read a biology book knows the world has methods of population control on its own, we don't need to be doing stuff like that ourselves."
190,notsarc,Well I guess Nato basically::p summed it up:Stupid is as stupid doe's.
191,notsarc,"You need to read what people say more thoroughly, and think about it before you respond. When he said ""can"" (and there are not many simpler words than that!) It didn't mean ""will"", ""must"", or ""shall"" be more aggressive. It has been shown that in some cases it ""CAN"" happen. It may not have happened with you. It still might, we don't know. We might even say that it is not likely to happen, but we can't say that it won't, because sometimes some people do behave more aggressively when they have a gun."
192,notsarc,"Not really. World forests are at risk for farm land and non-paper logging, not for paper which is being replaced by post consumer waste at increasing rates. Most paper people use today contains at least some recycled paper."
193,notsarc,Because it's a blatantly obvious fact of nature and intellectually honest experts in the field accept it.
194,notsarc,And they can be. Increases in complexity are readily achieved via incremental change.
195,notsarc,"So what, the thread isn't about her signature. If we started responding to threads by attacking people's signatures, we'd all be in serious trouble. Especially me emoticonXAngel"

197,notsarc,"Well, we'll ignore the fact that you think dinos are the same as modern day reptiles, and we'll ignore the fact that you are assuming that what goes today must have gone before (something you rant against on a daily basis). Who said anything about reptiles or dinosaurs?"
198,notsarc,"And how would Bush look if his own people hated him so much that they revolted? That would be very bad publicity, and quite an embarrassment that I wouldn't want as a country leader."

200,notsarc,"If Obama had his way, standing against the government would be the most patriotic thing someone could do."

202,notsarc,"But of course, according to one singularly deranged poster here, it's the Republicans  who are truly pro-gay (they just can't show it, doncha know), while the Democrats are just paying phony-baloney lip service to us..."
203,notsarc,"No. The pot should not have rights. You, however, should stop dropping acid :)"
204,notsarc,"No, everyone should have those regardless of marriage. You're the one here who seems to think straight and gay marriage should be a litmus test for those things."
205,notsarc,"Actually, it isn't. It is complex and complicated. It requires diligent study of difficult concepts. But when you grasp the basics, it does become evident. But most creationists aren't willing to put in the effort."
206,notsarc,"And then there's this:Alarm at routine patrols by armed police - Crime, UK - The Independent"
207,notsarc,"Hi jitobear. I am also pro-choice. This comment jumped out at me, though. Do you think it's seen as awful do to cultural conditioning? Could this have it wrong? There is no scientific basis that it's a human person, at the stage of development when the vast majority of abortions occur. I worry that by suggesting it's so negative, it can't help but be a stigma on the woman who chooses to abort her pregnancy. No woman should feel the need to apologize in relation to abortion, which is just about control over one's own body."

""The sky is black, the shadows powerful,God's domain judged by the unseen""Obviously this a prophetic for 26th dimensional superstring theory and how it governors the universe's physical properties in unforseen ways. Don't you see it? It's quite obvious! To the RATIONAL world, that is completely absurd, just like your analysis of how the scriptures work in your opninion. "
214,notsarc,"It's worse than that, Pandion. For example, here's what I told him over at ARN on the same subject back on April 5th. http://www.arn.org/ubbthreads/showfl...e#Post30331420"
215,notsarc,"And once it has begun, which would you rather have?"
216,notsarc,"Well, I did say I was being nit-picky: all I was objecting to was the way the original wording suggested that the change was occurring in order to avoid competition. Assuming it was due to selection, the competition from the larger birds was the putative agent of that selection.(Incidentally, I suspect we live on the same side of the Atlantic.)"
217,notsarc,"Well, as usual the Creationist is trying to make an arguement against science using their moral viewpoint. Forget about all that pseudo science trying to discredit evolution and geochronology, all it comes down to is this: ""My religion has the exact answers to questions about my origins, I do not like what science has to say on this subject"".Its so much more succinct that way, I just wish they could be up front about it."

224,notsarc,Well excuuuuse me if I screwed that up in this post. Have a nice day. :)
225,notsarc,"How elegant. Yes science is the way to understanding the physical world, and faith is the manifestation of our spiritual selves. But when you say this among sci-only people, it is immediately misconstrued. Most sci people won't even read that sentence objectively. Say the word ""spirit"" and suddenly you are changed into a fundamentalist, inbred, uneducated, dimwit who wouldn't know Planck's constant if it hit you in the head.Life is much more than a series of reactions. It is cool that we are able to reduce it down so much. The benefits of science are vast. But there just seems that there is more than meets the eye. I'm curious."
226,notsarc,"What we have here is simply a perspective problem, which is the problem with most debates. I see the Bible as sound, and every ""error"" in the Bible I have researched (I have admittedly not researched them all) have been refuted."

 Or, does this mean that God himself requires God's Will to exist? Cyclical! :xbanghead"
228,notsarc,"Almost?
 Usually, that is true, and it involves selection between populations. However, there are often times when some of a population is better able to survive. Those times, selection occurs within a population."
229,notsarc,"I gotta admit, I got a real chuckle out of this one. :pWaxy"
230,notsarc,"And how exactly do you propose this suggestion actually be enforced? Have you got it all thought out and prepared to defend in a debate, or are you just throwing out what the liberal loonies tell you is a good idea?"
231,notsarc,"Actually, you are living off my organs and life processes. If my heart stopped beating, would you get fed? No. If my brain stopped? No. If I suffered a stroke? No. Two, the kidnapping is very synonymous: you were put in a life-threatening situation without consent, just as a fetus, doomed to be aborted, is put in one without consent. Three, these are arbitrary requisites and you have not proven to me why they are necessary to afford protections to the ""entity."" A man just knocked out in a boxing match shares many similar qualities as a fetus. Should we kill him? Four is nullified by two."
232,notsarc,"This depends on the form of abortion: some involve stopping the womb being a suitable enviroment for the babies survival rather than killing it directly. However, of all the arguments it is possibly the most human rights based."
233,notsarc,"This is true from the atheistic and secular humanist perspective since they will grasp at any natural explanation, no matter how flimsy and shallow rather than the spiritual explanation. But it doesn't answer the specific question I asked at all."
234,notsarc,"emoticonXWowYou are making up your own strawman arguments as you go along.Asking ""what they would need"" is a poor mask to avoid the fact that YOU HAVE NO EVIDENCE in the first place.A lot of ""doesn't this look like ..."", but that's akin to interpreting Rorschach tests. You see what you want to."
235,notsarc,"Anyway Duo_Maxwell this isn't only creationist debaters, there are many more who do the same thing with different debates. you also forgot7. Make random accusations of logical fallacies when they have no idea what they even mean. Example: You said that my spelling is wrong, that's the biggest strawman I've ever heard8. Correct spelling mistakes and convienantly not answer the question. Example: ""What do you thinkk of carbon dating?"" ""you spelled think wrong"". If you want to correct spelling, fine but answer the question as well."
236,notsarc,"Yes, it is, and I'll gladly excuse his grammar compared to my zero ability in Hungarian."
237,notsarc,"What's great is that somebody had to have been on the lookout for PZ out of fear of his getting in. What's greater is that they opened themselves to ridicule: he's a good source when his statements can be edited and removed from context, but FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T LET HIM SEE THE MOVIE!"
238,notsarc,So much for your cover. Its blown. You just made another gaps argument making the assumption that if theory X does not explain observation Y that a theory which is untested and untestable MUST be the only alternative explanation. Balderdash and shame on you. The alternative theories would likely be numerous and the ONLY one is not something untested and untestable.But I forgive you GOD probably made you make the error for his own mysterious reasons. Or else your statement is evil and was forced upon you by the devil. Maybe you will never know - in this life at least :(
239,notsarc,"Yes it is, police aren't obligated by the US Constitution to protect individual citizens. If they were, lawsuits could be filed every time a crime is committed, and the police would go bankrupt really quick."
240,notsarc,BWAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH![/QUOTE]So you are saying that my DNA reflects the fact that I live in Texas?
241,notsarc,"Crammed with them, sure, why not? Its easy, only a few million light years. The scientific method is used in weather forecasting too. "
242,notsarc,"Well said. It is a disgrace that the ""Flat Earth"" side of the argument never gets a look in geography lessons and that the ""Spontaneous Creation"" side of the argument never gets a look in when teaching kids about the life cycle of insects. Do you realise that they refuse to present the ""Cheese"" side of the argument when teaching about the moon these days? It's outrageous, how can our kids get a balanced education if such bias is allowed to continue!"
243,notsarc,Well that explains your anger.:p I hope you are blessed with homeliness.:) Makes your commitment easier to keep. How old are you now?
244,notsarc,"So,are you saying that all anti-gunners are fearless???If so,,I must laugh."
245,notsarc,"You know what the funny thing is about all of the ""links"" that they have found between ape and man? I could easily find people today that look exactly like the ""links"" that scientists have found. Maybe you should try picking one ""link"" from the site that you gave me. I could give you creationist sites, but that wouldn't prove anything more than your site proved. Here's an alternative theory: creation by God."
246,notsarc,No baby is more precious than another as far as my personal beliefs go it is no more alright to terminate a baby concieved through rape/incest than it is to terminate a baby classed as a mistake/inconvenience.
247,notsarc,"Oh, we could let them in I guess. How much room would it take up in a textbook, two pages maybe?"
248,notsarc,"And what evidence do you have, aside from a set of books written between 1900 and 2800 years ago that there is even a 'God' to box with. OH.. and the ectasy drivien delusional state of mind you get in when you worship.As for the answer to the origins of life, how would you know? Do you know what the current state of affairs about the knowledge of abiogenesis is? Can you point to articles about it , showing it can't happen?? From peer reviewed journals of course.NO, you can't. I can show a lot of articles about abiogenesis , but that would be worthless for you. You would be unwilling to look at it. I could show you articles about on the development of gender, and of how sexual reproduction became to be formed, but you wouldn't look at it."
249,notsarc,"Actually, the Mormon seminaries aren't ""on the grounds,"" although they may be on an adjacent, privately owned piece of property. It would be unconstitutional for the seminaries to be on property owned by the school district. The children go to the seminary on released-time, which has been found to be constitutional (although I don't see how).Pertinent decisions about religious instruction and schools are:McCollum v. Board of Education (333 U.S. 203)Zorach v. Clauson (343 U.S. 306)McCollum found that religious instruction on school property is unconstitutional, while Zorach found that ""accommodating"" religious instruction by releasing students from school for that purpose was not."
250,notsarc,"No it doesn't. That's why Darwin objected to the use of that phrase in reference to his theory. Those who don't bother to learn the theory tend to misunderstand. Fittness is not a reference to big and strong. It makes it too easy to misrepresent evolutionary theory.I'll state it again since you seem to have missed or ignored it the first time. Natural selection is differential reproductive success. Those organisms that are well adapted to their environment tend to survive to reproduce in greater numbers, and therefore they tend to leave more offspring, than those organisms that are less well adapted.You've got to be a pretty shallow thinker to equate an environmental advantage with big and strong."
251,notsarc,Said like a cruel evil person who has no concern for his fellow man.
252,notsarc,"You know, this little phrase, ""minutes before birth,"" keeps popping up in reference to abortion.Could someone please explain to me the point of having an abortion ""minutes before birth""? What is the point?How many, if any, of this sort of abortion is performed?Could I get a really honest answer to that? Please, no lies.How many?Can anyone tell me?"
253,notsarc,"Oh, there's no hypocrisy involved, just you being your usual self and not even looking at the actual information (or, more likely, looking at the information and then deliberately playing dumb)."
254,notsarc,If you think that it's OK when the Mother's life is in danger. Why wouldn't it be OK when her life isn't in danger?
255,notsarc,"A Jungian might suggest such a stance. In other words, one (good) cannot exist without the other (evil). I wonder what some of our more interesting christian friends (AA, GC) might have to say about such?"
256,notsarc,"Little boy, you need to do a little study on Nazis. They specialized in death. Unlike pro-life people."
257,notsarc,But I'll bet that you don't know what any of them are. 
258,notsarc,"I see that river runs wide and deep on the left bank, de Nile."
259,notsarc,And there are plenty of cases where criminals are scared off by much less than a gun.
260,notsarc,"Well, I don't work with any ""reefer heads"" or pot smokers now...this was awhile back."
261,notsarc,"This is simply false. Rock can be folded under pressure. This has been proven by lab experiment. However there are many features in sedimentary rocks that cannot be formed quickly, for example, fossil trackways."
262,notsarc,"Hmm, when you say ""numberless"" do you mean something other than the standard definition of infinite? If not, please explain how an infinite number of organisms could be created in a finite time with finite space and resources. Thank you."
263,notsarc,"And Stephen Hawking, the only thing he has said was ""I do not believe in a personal god"", which would make him a pantheist or deist at best."
264,notsarc,"And last years stats say, 3rd July 2009   The most violent country in Europe: Britain is also worse than South Africa and U.S."
265,notsarc,"The desperate flailings of a city with absolutely no common sense. They're so impotent in their abilities to get tough on criminals, they feel it necessary to go after the most unrelated sources to try and make themselves look big and busy.Why not just build a big wall to cut itself off from the rest of the world, and set up high security check points so cars coming and going can be checked to ensure no contraband is being smuggled in."
266,notsarc,Exactly and if you accept that animals have been on the Earth for millions of years then why can't evolution be a process that God created and controls?
267,notsarc,"What the father wants is ultimately irrelevent.It's the woman's body that carries the fetus. It ultimately the woman's decision. As wrong as that may seem to you, it is the reality.If we, as a society, would just address the issue of unwanted pregnancies, then we, as a society, will resolve the isse of abortion."
268,notsarc,"Nonsense. The most widely accepted idea is that these epics were oral traditions that were finally recorded in writing, possibly by a guy named Homer. Read and read."
269,notsarc,"And if God was so against killing the unborn, why did he fail to make an exception for the pregnant women? If you alleged that the Biblical God is totally against killing the unborn, why did he tell him to kill all of the non-virgin women?I bet you won't answer the question and just rely on insults as an attempt to cover up your argumentative failures as you always do. See my signature for examples. "
270,notsarc,"amen, brother! stay as far from new ideas as possible, and no one will come between you and your stories!"
271,notsarc,"Like blacks once were? Wasn't that the main thrust of the 14th amendment and incorporation? Given incorporation, imagine the suits those acts of discrimination would bring emoticonXGood "
272,notsarc,"Actually, 2 viruses and a bacteria have been constructed by building the genome from nucleic acids."
273,notsarc,"Are they planning fun fair rides and people dressed as Mickey Mouse at this place? There could even have a ""feed the T Rex"" event where people get to throw lettuce sandwiches into the ""dino pit"" emoticonXHohoThat gives me an idea. Why don't we have a competition to come up with the best suggestion for a display or show at this theme park? The winner gets to feel smug for being so clever ;)"
274,notsarc,"Because you seem to lose sight of that with your whackjob ideas. Case in point ""The manufacturer would have to know where to point LE"" now you have the manufacturer involved in law enforcement. Would you have the big 3 involved in pointing out to LE who last bought their products involving drive bys and vehicular homicide? You have no clue as to how the whole process works yet you are going to put your oar in and muddy the process. Here's a small lesson for you. The manufacturers of firearms don't sell to dealers. They sell to distributors who in turn sell to dealers. You are still lacking any valid proof that the law abiding are the problem. "
275,notsarc,"Then why aren't doctors who advise rest and plenty of fluids for a cold in jail? Oh right, because you're lying, as usual."
276,notsarc,"so since most abortions weren't rape, do you still support abortions for people who are raped? Just wondering."
277,notsarc,"And what exactly am i granting to the suit-wearing politicians in washington by giving them the right to revoke her ability to make these decisions for herself? I don't think dictatorship is the right word, since she is not asking for the power over anyone but herself, and her child. Would you call a man dying of inoperable cancer who decides to end his chemotherapy a dictator? Or a parent who decides to remove their child from life-support?Would you rather it be a democracy? That everytime a woman is faed with this predicament, we put it to a vote? How about an oligarchy- where her situation is put in front of some committee who decides her fate?"
278,notsarc,"I'm afraid it is you who is wrong. I created you so that you would think you created me to think I created everything, even though I did. It's more of a challenge that way to try to convert people to the one true religion. Since you can see that I won't be able to convert the world (it's due in a week), you can pay $100 dollars to me so I will take you with me to the upper world."
279,notsarc,When you have no constructive comment just attacks the messenger with your insultsand name calling.....typical...............so very sad..........Its radicals like you that hurt the cause of gay rights.........
280,notsarc,"Yes. The assumption happens to be that maybe the bible isn't literal. ""Lets look into ourselves, shall we?"" Behold we did, and Lo! The Earth is old!"
281,notsarc,"addition works in the intangible as well. 1 minute + 1 minute = 2 minutes. 1 idea + 1 idea = 2 ideas. the concept of quantity is not limited to matter. if there was just a vaccous void were absolutely nothing was happening, then there would be no application of logic. but even that in itself would be logical. nothing + nothing = nothing is logical. it would actually be logical if a void with nothing added to it result in something. so even in a void, logic still prevails"
282,notsarc,"haha, probably very smart of you ;) It gets heated in here"
283,notsarc,Still clueless and still presenting a barrel of laffs I see. Have someone that can read and comprehend spell it out for you. I bet yer mun is considering that to get you out of the basement. How's the weight loss coming by the way?
284,notsarc,"Yes, I'm always a step behind the word definition switcharoos. I have been told many times on 4forums that abiogenesis is not science."
285,notsarc,Actually I didn't even read it (and doubt I ever will). Don't get all worked up over it.
286,notsarc,"This is why arguments like ""well, our population is out of control"" never convince ANY Pro-Life advocate that abortion is okay. I think it is amusing when pro-choice people use such arguments... Pro-Lifers have a priority list, and Life makes it to the top. For Pro-Lifers, it's a little like saying ""Well, Big Macs taste good, so you should never, ever eat filet mignon since burgers taste good!"" I mean, sure, burgers taste good, but filet mignon is so much better."
287,notsarc,"Oh boy, you said it!
 
 Is the Earth's Magnetic Field Young?"
288,notsarc,"1.)Refusing to comment on scientific procedure means absolutely nothing. Maybe we don't have anything to say.2.)Testing your beliefs of your own scientific conclusions is not wrong.3.)I don't lie dude.4.)Because we don't give the response you would like is not wrong.5.)Don't think so.6.)The only thing classical ad-naeseum is your own preconceived idea's of creationism and creationist.You don't want to debate the issues like normal civil people, you just want try to make fools of creationists. Usually you're the one who start's the insulting. Your hatred is obivious and you're open to nothing. Just good 'ol boys patting each other on the back. I know this probably doesn't apply to everyone, there are some good guys out there. emoticonXAngel"
289,notsarc,"Well, I have heard people on the pro-gun side say that most defensive gun uses don't involve firing even one round. So limiting the capacity would probably have less of an effect on the ability to defend yourself than on crime. So why are people from the gun lobby always whining about restrictions like this? When semi-automatic rifles were banned in Australia, hunters welcomed the law. They saw it as a challenge because it takes greater skill to shoot an animal with a bolt action rifle. Not so in America where some gun owners like to use guns that could take down planes to shoot small animals."
290,notsarc,But the sea and sky are the same regardless. I would say the sailor conceives the information with language. He infers the information with language.
291,notsarc,Well if they're automatic weapons then they're obviously importing them illegally from outside the country and violating federal regulations. You've got even bigger problems than you think.
292,notsarc,You know you are full of it when you claim they can't just walk into a gun show. Strange that can can do just that at a licensed dealers. What would be so very different than checking licensed dealers at a gun shop and investigating the same at a show? Go back to the Brady bunch and see if they have any facts that prevent the BATF from doing any thing. Try again Brady as your logic and facts just don't hold up. edit: The BATFE checks paperwork as part of their investigations. Federal laws are not suspended at gun shows as you would have the uneducated and ill informed believe.
293,notsarc,"You accuse others of making an assumption to the answer.
 But then you admit that YOU think the answer should have been assumed.
 
 Do you see a problem here?"
294,notsarc,"DC has a law that human and civil rights can not be put up for a vote, this is the way it should be in the rest of the country. Why do you want to be able to vote on other peoples lives? Why is it that you are so cruel?"
295,notsarc,"And for the record, i think anyone that tries to take away a women's right to her own body is a sexist and has no respect for human life, or has any concious about the woman at stake here. You care merely about a couple of cells and not about the real humans, nor do you care about society. It seems to me you are only trying to earn yourself brownie points in heavan. I am not influenced by that, im going to have my own opinions, and speak about what i feel is right instead of some christian god telling me what to do."
296,notsarc,"How? What exactly did they say, that God didn't invent every living thing individually? I'm interested to learn what information you specifically feel was a fabrication."
297,notsarc,"Different version here too. ""No one born of a forbidden marriage nor any of his descendants may enter the assembly of the LORD , even down to the tenth generation."" Forbidden: not permitted or allowed"
298,notsarc,"But recognition of the big bang as a very good explanation of cosmology isn't limited to evolutionsits. In fact, most other scientists also believe so, most especially cosmologists and astrophysicists, who are directly concerned with the early universe. Evolutionists, even though the origin of matter and time are irrelevant to the study of evolution, are also educated in science and probably accept the work done by these other scientists."
299,notsarc,"Heres how it makes sense; If atheists seek to support their belief system, they are more likely to accept what science tells them about topics like this without giving the details much thought. People are often short on patience you know, post # 40 indicates it. I honestly wonder if those analogies dont soar over many peoples heads. They're not scientific, they're common sense. But if an educated person disregards them because of impatience, or arrogance directed at the source, it can obliterate the effect of their education. It's the difference in having been taught what to think, vs. knowing how to think. There is a reason why the most successful countries involve people besides only the educated in the political process. "
300,notsarc,"That means that you view mental existence as being critical to our existence as a person. What about the body? If we were all mind and no body (this, granted, is purely a hypothetical and is often referred to in the hypothetical supernatural sense as a soul), would we still exist as people? If not, then what would we be?I agree that our bodies are an important part of how we view ourselves but are they part of the very core? I would sincerely miss my legs if they had to be amputated. However, I would still exist. Taking it to the extreme, I would sincerely miss my body if all that were left was a functioning brain, but I would still exist."
301,notsarc,Psh Leiberman is a one man party that much is true. He's a lone wolf and by all rights I hope the whole pack of dogs eat him up...I'm personally getting fed up with politics... Change we can believe in.. Yeah getting republicans and democrats to work together is like getting Palestinian and Israelis to build a joint place of worship... or even a wal mart.. NEVER gonna happen...Oh and the only hope I have is that Costco is still hiring cause this economy is XXXX.....emoticonXKill
302,notsarc,"We need to have far better prenatal and obstetrical care for all women in the world. All truly caring human beings would endorse such care for women, as well as access to contraceptive education and access to reliable contraception to prevent such horrible consequences from pregnancy."
303,notsarc,"This has to be what the 5th time you've been given links to educate yourself?http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC371_1.htmlhttp://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dinosaur/flesh.htmlBut I don't think you'll understand. You fail to understand such a pedestrian concept as Erosion, I frankly don't expect you to understand those two links. But humor me. "
304,notsarc,"So we should just say ""god did it"", and give up?"
305,notsarc,"That is one definition of creation. There are many. You again make a mistake of making an assumption about what you want to argue about, and argue against that.If you want a (non-exhaustive list) seehttp://www.crystalinks.com/creation.htmlYou have simply picked one model, treated it as the only one, and constructed a (thus false) argument against it."
306,notsarc,"In other words: No, but I like to think they have!"
307,notsarc,"WF, that is true and if the young lady life is endangered then to terminate the pregnancy would be appropriate but get a neutral doctor to make that decision, not one from Planned Parenthood or and abortion clinic who have a biased interest in performing abortions...............That is all I ask..........."
308,notsarc,"I'm still confused by this comment. Did you actually mean that? If you did, that is not Pro-choice but Pro-abortion. Women did not have a choice in whether their pregnancies were terminated or not which, having it, is the definition of the PC point of view. So no, they were NOT Pro-choice."
309,notsarc,Sounds like the Brady Law has stopped a lot of criminals from obtaining handguns.
310,notsarc,Which of course says volumes. On the other hand such metaphors are appropriate in many cases. For example consider the vaccination program for smallpox which eradicated the disease FAPP. It was indeed a struggle and new tools and techniques were critical to reaching the objective. From Jenner to the end of the virus as a human pathogen.
311,notsarc,"I can't imagine it either, but if I had to pick one type of business most capable of turning a government mandate into a profit, insurance companies would get my vote. I'm afraid that too many people subconsiously think that conflicts between opposites like health providers (or trial lawyers) vs. insurance companies result in victory for the general public. Shandag's comments show that they both can have common interests (State mandates) that result in wins for both of them and a loss for the general public."
312,notsarc,"If there is a positive relationship between drug consumption and crime, it doesn`t seem very likely that crime would go down as a result of lowering the price on drugs (and thus rasing consumption)."
313,notsarc,"The Second Amendment does not apply to an Ohio Law. Thus, this ban is not unconstituitonal under the US Constitution. The Ohio Constitution, may however, protect gun rights, but I haven't read it."
314,notsarc,"It's true, I find the story on sites that are generally anti-bush. However, this was a radio show transcript, not a site. Larry Flint says ""'I've talked to the woman's friends,' Flynt said. 'I've tracked down the doctor who did the abortion, I tracked down the Bush people who arranged for the abortion,' Flynt said. 'I got the story nailed."" I haven't seen it either confirmed or denied by anyone more reputable."
315,notsarc,Criminals continually inform the public that their greatest fear is a victim capable of fighting back against them and possibly killing them.
316,notsarc,"Well, that is PART of the Scientific Theory of Evolution. There is more to the Scientific Theory, such as adaptation to local changes in the environment and the ability to use new niches and so on."
317,notsarc,And thats factually (and logically incorrect). There are many alternatives virtually an infinitude of them in fact.
318,notsarc,Again? What do you mean? I am talking about different sciences per se. What is your question?
319,notsarc,That&#8217;s not the problem. The problem is how do you account for all the different species that are on the earth today coming from what you say were on the ark?
320,notsarc,"Jake,
 Thanks for finding that link again.
 
 Perhaps you can answer the same question I posed to Carla?"
321,notsarc,"I don't know if we can be as accurate as a couple of million years, but I agree that the age of the earth is just right for supporting man."
322,notsarc,"Jesus was then what he is now: the Logos of God (Philo, quis rerum divinarum heres 42.405), the heavenly High Priest (Hebrews), the culmination of Gods eternal plan (Ro. 16:25), the secret mystery only now, after his sacrifice, revealed through revelation and scripture (1 Cor 2:6-13)."
323,notsarc,"I think you nailed it! I also think that if you are willing to give up your relationship over religion you could be on the border of addiction not faith. (not you personally, but rhetorically)"
324,notsarc,"Ah ha! Someone who understands the application of information theory to biological organisms. By the biological specific definition of information, the genome of any organism is information about the environment in which it lives."
325,notsarc,"We can. Geological fossils of severial species, along with observations of specific species in isolated areas."
326,notsarc,These aren't the only two options available. The many philosophical views of the material world or ethics don't mean these two things don't exist.
327,notsarc,Not at all. The theory of evolution contains many many things.
328,notsarc,"Would you care to explain exactly what was lacking? For only a few minutes, that video was profoundly extensive, showing almost precisely how our eyes would have evolved."
329,notsarc,"So much for lists of registration and ""safe storage"". Same thing happened when Hitler took over a country and got hold of all the lists. They were especially interested in the gun lists and radio lists."
330,notsarc,"Really? What a surprise! So tell me. If you don't know what it is or how it works, how do you know that you are opposed to it?"
331,notsarc,"I think that getting your tubes tied is a responsible act. I was just inquiring about the motive for doing so. Too bad more women (and men) don't share your level of responsibility. If they did, we wouldn't need to debate the ""need"" for abortions. emotico"
332,notsarc,"I believe this is wrong. But this is a private company, and if they want to discriminate based on religion, that's fine, just as a church may outlaw atheists. Do I agree with it? No. But does it have to do with our debate? No. This is about the science classroom. Also, again abiogenesis is a hypothesis, the same level as ID."
333,notsarc,"And that's all irrelevent, because pages 240-243 concern what happens in the world today, not what happened concerning creation. His feelings about God's interactions with the world today would be different if he had a basic knowledge of the Bible."
334,notsarc,"Heller is about determining the answer to a long standing question on the nature of the Second Amendment, and how much gun control is legally allowed. Roe v. Wade is about finding legal precedent for the murder of unborn children.I see absolutely no comparison between the two."
335,notsarc,"Another lie.
 
 The sentence you've quoted never made any such argument."
336,notsarc,"That's not exactly true now, is it? People get to vote for elected officials, and that's all that's guaranteed federally. Some states have provisions for allowing people to vote on local laws, but in some states the government is allowed to prevent the vote. And of course there is no provision at all allowing the people to vote on federal laws. So in point of fact it is a true statement that in the United States someone is not allowed to vote on X, for some values of X."
337,notsarc,"Actually, the dating is done on layers above and below the rock in which fossils are found. You see, generally fossils are found in some sort of sedimentary rock. And sedimentary rock cannot be dated. But a layer of volcanic ash above and below the fossil can be dated and thus give a date within a range."
338,notsarc,They are: those that survive better reproduce more. Members of a species can die if other members have better food/light/attention/camaflouge.
339,notsarc,"Archie is NOT right - he has an opinion, as we all do. Pro-lifers seem to want the definition of human with attendant rights to begin at conception. The blastocyst is now turning into a tumour. So the pro-lifers can now alter their views on what constitutes 'human' as and when it suits their purpose.Forget the emotive view of what an embryo/foetus looks like: some think that as long as it has appendages and looks human, then it IS. It isn't. It's still a parasitic organism dependant on the host mother. You can't deny that.Contraception v. abortion is a separate issue: in the meantime, the host mother should be the final arbiter of what happens to her body."
340,notsarc,"Well, I'd say that since that sort of question don't have a pat and universal answer, then that's why they shouldn't have been asked in the first place, in this case. My view is that questions over a job like this should be about a person's qualifications"
341,notsarc,"I've been around the creationist/science discussions for a number of years, about 20 or so. The ""you believe in evolution"" argument has been around for at least that long. In my experience it has been a waste of breath to try to convince creationists that I don't believe in evolution any more than they do. As I recall, the argument was even presented in a court case back in the late 60s, or maybe it was the early 80s. I could be wrong. I'll have to check on that."
342,notsarc,And I'm going to correct you again. The theory of evolution is by no means an extreme view. It is the prevailing view. More than 99% of biologists accept the theory of evolution as the best explanation for the observations.
343,notsarc,"very true. logic exists whether people are there to grasps its concepts or not.where we disagree is at your assumption that god created logic. how can this be? logic is not contingent on any intelligent entity, whether it be man or god, to exist. the logic of increasing a quantity by adding to it would remain whether god existed or not. you have yet to tie the existence of logic to god as its cause"
344,notsarc,"Because the Iliad and Odyssey do not claim to be divine does not mean they should be placed under a different threshold as the Bible. Otherwise, it's special pleading on your part, and thus logically fallacious. This is one of many inconsistencies between skeptics in regards to the scrutiny of the Bible. They are unwilling to put the standards they have on the Bible against other books similar in age. If they did, there would not be a single book left standing."
345,notsarc,And that is why they are referred to as creationists and not merely as christians. They are only a small subset of the huge christian population.
346,notsarc,"Exactly. Moreover, in Emerson the discussion of the 2nd Am. is dicta (arguments not pertinent to the verdict) so it is not a binding precedent even for the courts in the same Circuit.A question for the ""original intent"" crowd:What did the Founding Fathers intend with the misplaced comma in the 2nd Amendment?"
347,notsarc,"But it really does deal with thinking. It can invite a more wide open scientific investigation of ecological and developmental patterns. It's not politically afraid to pursue facts about newly discovered complexities of life which pose problems for those trying to make a case for happenstance origins. It invites thought, not suppression, of irreducible complexity, another problem for happenstance origins. "
348,notsarc,We don't actually know this for sure. There is some data but much speculation as to what is exactly causing larger and more frequent storms. The bigger problem of reducing salinity is the currents themselves and how they intergrate with migration and heat transfer. Sources of food that humans depend upon could disappear if currents drastically change. And the basis of Day after Tommorrow is correct in how the gulf stream helps regulate temperatures in Europe.
349,notsarc,"Oh, undoubtedly - but the offspring aren't inheriting traits as such are they? They're just suffering the same symptoms of malnutrition as their parents, except that for them it's happening in vitro so they exhibit the effects from birth. That's why it's such a bad example for what you're trying to get others to accept."
350,notsarc,"Well... so far eight out of nine state supreme courts that have taken up the issue have found that barring same-sex marriage is unconstitutional.We're waiting to hear about three or four more.As for the nature of marriage, it is both a legal contract and (sometimes) a religious ceremony (sacrament in some religions). We're stuck with the duality, whether we like it or not, and the courts can and must deal with the legal aspect. Different religions can do what they want."
351,notsarc,"Yes, I would stay out of it, unless I knew the woman, and she spoke up and asked me for an opinion, or advice. And even in the case of the woman being my best friend, and knowing all the different aspects to the situation, I still would not feel comfortable weighing in. Just like if it was me in the situation, I know that ultimately, it would be my decision, and I would have a right to that decision."
352,notsarc,"Ill be the first to agree with the saying ""If you can...and have the place to...you will"" But like anything else..you have to look at the better side of things...It would act like a deterant to allow our responsable citizens to be armed..yes perhaps what you said might take place..but the benefits would outway them..and thats all we can ask for in life.As for our irresponsable citizens...they are already armed."
353,notsarc,"Here's a picture of ithttp://www.toyen.uio.no/palmus/galle...re/161_632.jpgThe specimens have been dated between 120 & 140 my. If at the upper end of that range that puts it very close to the age of Archaeopteryx (140 to 170 my).But contrary to what creationists like to claim, this isn't a problem. There is no claim that Archaeopteryx is ancestral to Confuciusornis. If you look at birds now you will see lots of different species. They have a common ancestor but are not descended from one another. Archaeopteryx is just the oldest example of a bird that we have, and considering the distance between the sites where the fossils were found, and possibly several million years in time, I would expect them to be different."
354,notsarc,"Like the above quote, why is the church trying to stop abortion when they would consider one to be alive after taking a breath. if you were to look at it from a scientific standpoint, the individual ovum and sperm are living cells, but they die all the time and no one cares. An embryo or fetus is something starting to develop into a human and that can't be stopped without killing it or injecting differnt DNA, but it's still not too different from sperm and ovum.If you can't trust the church to make fair decisions and follow values and morals and rules they put in place, how can you expect an honest good decision about anything from it."
355,notsarc,"Personally, I don't have a problem with a single thing you said.You made your CHOICE, and we in the Pro-Choice camp respect your right to choose.Now, just don't go around trying to impose your choice (which I personally think is perverted and sexist) on the women in my family.You have the obligation to respect their choices just as we respect yours.BTW, please tell Gush Limpbutt that there is a world of difference between human, i.e, possessing the right genes, and personhood, which begins at birth."
356,notsarc,What does being a priest have to do with anything? It wouldn't matter if he were a Satan worshipper.
357,notsarc,"Are you suggesting that if abortion were banned that abortion clinics that are already done will flood the US? Please, get real here. People would probably go across the bordor and get abortions there...you might have drugs from canada come over that cause abortion but there is no reason to believe this will ""clog"" up the jails. People need to realize that is was only 30yrs ago that abortion was pretty much illegal (in most states). Did you see prisons flooded ? no."
358,notsarc,"Don't think so. Provide an example of an ""unbridaled capitalist"" system operating in the 19th century."
359,notsarc,"Because what inspired my argument/debate challange was the Questions for both sides thread, it was full of vague/popular laymans usages of the term, and you cant blame only me for it, since I didn't start the thread, and since I was only about 1/10 of all the broad usages of the term going on in that thread, the rest were coming from evolutionists. Please read its opening post (by an evolutionist)  youre not going to find much about biology there. "
360,notsarc,"So Gup20 wants to play word games. (Sigh) This is usually a sign that he or she has run out of logical arguments. Anyway, this topic is in another thread. I won't discuss it here."
361,notsarc,"Stevens said that bear arms has a military meaning. So was he saying that the right is individual but existed in connection with militia service? Is this some kind of hybrid model? Interestingly, scholars who made similar claims in the past got lumped in with those who supported a collective right by the pro gun crowd. But I suppose it sounds good to say that all nine Supreme Court justices supported an individual rights interpretation. "
362,notsarc,"A) we can use experiments to show evoution. We have observed it. For example, there is the lactose test, where some bacterial had the geneto digest lactose removed. After letting it grow into the billions, andthen fed ONLY lactose, it can be shown that some individuals had a genethat could digest lactose, and survive. There is also anti-bodic resistantbacteria that evolved due to the use of antibodics .. evolution at work."
363,notsarc,"Sigma I have taken into account the options a woman has after pregnancy. However, there are no doubt cases in the history of the world (not just within America) where there were no options available to a mother but to keep her child (ie: the first human woman to give birth in the history of the world). For this pro-choice line of reasoning to be absoulutely true it must be true in every possible situation. Are you saying that the killing would be justified if no other options were available to her?"
364,notsarc,"I know of a similar argument that could be misinterpreted:Evolution producing what exists today could have gone any one of millions of ways. However, it isn't much surprise that what we have came out of it, just like it wouldn't be a surprise for a random number generator to come up with 475475.339: something had to come out, and something did.Chances are, you are referring to that argument."
365,notsarc,"The Grand canyon could not have been created by a flood event, the geology is all wrong: http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/icr-science.htmlThe flood explains nothing which cannot be explained by other, better-supported means and directly contradicts vast swathes of evidence:Biodivesity and the fossil record are not consistent with the flood.Genetic profiling is not consistent with the flood (in humans and animals)The Ark could not hold all animal life.A global mark would have left marks across the entire globe at a consistent time period; these marks are not found."
366,notsarc,"Do you believe that the freedom to not participate in any religion whatsoever is not covered by the expression ""Freedom of Religion""?"
367,notsarc,"The concept that science no longer looks at animals boggles my mind. My brother is a wildlife biology major in college meaning his primary focus is......looking at animals and their relationships to one another. It is somewhat understandable that your misconception could arise because molecular biology and genetic engineering are the latest crazes in science. The simple fact is most of the big breakthroughs when studying whole animals have been made. A similar turn has occured in chemistry. I could argue that chemists have subtly turned away from chemical reactions. All the research now is about electron orbitals and nano-structures. The reason for this is these are new fields that are relatively young and many scientists are interested in them. I myself am doing research on buckminster fullerenes. It doesn't mean we've abandoned good old fashioned reactions, we just have more field to play in now."
368,notsarc,"I'm not claiming any omnipotent deciever. I'm not sure where you derive 'probability' from, or how you can have any degree of certainty over your past experiences or those of other consciousnesses.And in any case, saying 'it hasn't happened yet' is hardly logical proof."
369,notsarc,"Oh, I suspect my kid likes girls well enough, but most of them aren't any good at football so he finds them relatively useless (unless they are good at video games).Lots of kids were losing it early when i was young, too. I remember it being peer pressure thing, an attampt to be cool. And I also remember sex ed being pretty sad...."
370,notsarc,"And with the possible exception of collecting, Australian licensing laws allow all of the above. I should know I have lived and shot over there. The idea of such laws is to remove weapons from those who have no good reason to own such things, and put extra safety restrictions on those who do.For the record, I do not actually agree with such stringent measures myself. But I don't think your argument really holds water. And to make such associations with tyranny is exagerated to say the least."
371,notsarc,"No, that was not an argument. It was an illustration of a point. The point was this: that in order to stand in moral judgment of God, you would have to be of higher moral character than God. In other words, you would have to be God in order to judge God. Now, the point I made is that this is highly unlikely, as any being claiming to be God would not misspell words, no matter how closely the letters are on the keyboard.To be clear, I was not attacking you (at least I didn't intend to) by calling out your spelling mistake. I was trying to illustrate a point. And the point was this: you are not perfect, and therefore, you are not God. And if you are not God, then you really cannot stand in moral judgment of God."
372,notsarc,I didn't vote for a republican or a democrat in 2008 and in 2010 it doesn't matter because my rep is not challenged.

374,notsarc,"Far from showing any modern knowledge of blood circulation, this shows:1) if you take the blood out of an animal it will die. A simple fact all civilizations of the time would have known.2) God like for his followers kill living things. He is the God of blood."
375,notsarc,"And many news stories have referred to the New York shooter as being armed with a ""high powered rifle"" despite the fact that this was blatantly false. Why should we take this story as being fully factual about the details of background checks and gun shows?And a lot of newspapers are repeating the claims that fully-automatic machine guns, anti-tank missiles, fragmentation grenades and rocket launchers, are being bought by mexican drug cartel members -even though they couldn't possibly pass a background check- and that they're being bought from gun stores in America! But no matter how many times we demand proof of such, NONE IS EVER PRESENTED!Come back with undeniable proof that FFL dealers never conduct federally mandated background checks when selling guns at gun shows, otherwise don't post on the topic anymore since you have nothing but lies and scare mongering tactics."
376,notsarc,"There is no need for prey animals to grow a third or forth eye as a defense mechanism. Binocular vision works. Its balanced and can render 3d positioning in the mind accurately. The lizard that you mentioned is born with a spot sensitive to light which helps the body absorb vitamin d, as humans do due to skin that is light-sensitive to a certain extent. It isn't an eye for defending against predators, and it doesn't need one. As for insects, the fact that they've survived for such a long time goes to show that they have adapted adequately and are doing well. Have you tried sneaking up on a fly lately?"
377,notsarc,Just because it isn't verbally found in the Constitution doesn't mean I feel that it is constitutionally irrelevant. I feel that it is. Here is my question to you...do you understand why abortion is constitutional?
378,notsarc,"This argument is self-defeating. A theory is not a fact, no matter how much evidence may support the theory. Bad wording. But again, if you claim something as a fact, you must have proof, verified in both your method of reasoning, and the reasoning utilized by the person you are proving the fact to."
379,notsarc,We know this because the kids destroyed all the interactive exhibits within a day when the Earth Gallery opened. I for one was most upset as I'd been wanting to have a play too emoticon_cry
380,notsarc,"That is an erroneous line of reasoning because it fails to take into account the myriad of other options open to a women after birth to remove the newborn from her care without any ill effects (physically anyway). Killing in the instance of a newborn is not justified because of those other options open to her. By contrast, a pregnant woman has exactly one option open to her to remove the fetus from her care and that is abortion. I would contend that the same line of reasoning that allows for adoption can be used here, that no one must donate their resources to a dependant.Your reasoning that a woman, using the same line of reasoning that pro-choice people employ, can withhold her bodily resources ""until the newborn dies"" as if that is equal to withholding bodily resources in pregnancy is faulty."
381,notsarc,"No one wants to take your ""marriage"" away Matt. It's a free country--no one's going to block your way to any chapel that will marry you. Do your gay thing. But let marriage be marriage--it's a different matter. People just want to keep you from tampering with the institution of marriage."
382,notsarc,Same in the US. The father does not have the right to choose.
383,notsarc,"This is my understanding as well. Interestingly, concepts only approximate that which they intend to define. Confusion between concept and actuality is fertile ground for misunderstanding."
384,notsarc,Twelve out of literally millions. That's far too small a number to justify your position.
385,notsarc,"Falling, the fact that the homeschoolers you mentioned don't choose to socialize with you, doesn't mean they're not far more capable of functioning in the ""REAL WORLD"" than you might think. I would not choose to socialize with you in the ""REAL WORLD"", and you most likely would not choose to socialize with me, but that does not make me your social inferior!"
386,notsarc,"Again, what evidence? anthropic principle doesn't have anything to do with creation. Puntucated Equlibrium anyone? How is symbiotic relations beteween plants and insects sign of creation?What are you talking about? A dog can't have a cat. That's retarded. What facts are you talking abot? "
387,notsarc,"Yes but the proposal was for a formal type debate judged by a third party. Here we are just discussing the debate so far.
 
 Welcome to the forum."
388,notsarc,What about the similarities between the museum and a church?
389,notsarc,"And evolution is exhausted. It can't do anything with origins, and recent discoveries of the complexities of the simplest forms of life exhaust it even more."
390,notsarc,That is true but that is the procedure.........Do you deny it?
391,notsarc,"Good, you can address the claims made here, too.

 An absolute morality requires absolute consensus, and there isn't any."

394,notsarc,"They are merely taking chemicals that they can detect in outer space and reproducing the enviroment they are found in, by exposing them to ultraviolet. You are exposed to ultraviolet when you walk outside in the sunshine.Every chemical that they used is readily detected in interstellar molecular clouds."
395,notsarc,"Well . . . one could make that argument about anything--voting for instance. Amendments are created by voting, and people and legislatures vote (hopefully) their conscience (and the will of their constituents), even if they are religious. I think this is a different matter than, say, displaying religious icons on courtroom walls or grounds, which is a clear endorsement of religion by the government. The 18th amendment was religion-motivated, but it didn't get rescinded for THAT reason. It got rescinded because it didn't work practically. (and because FDR wanted to see the returns on the economy for his New Deal)"
396,notsarc,"There are some very rare cases where abortion is legitimately allowable by society. However, most abortions do not fall under this catagory."
397,notsarc,"Because the location of the tracks used to be a tidal plane. In other words, it used to be at the edge of the ocean. Around that time the sea coast advanced and receded several times. The tracks were buried. The tracks actually had to be uncovered. The tracks were originally discovered immdiately after an unusually severe storm in the area in which an unusual amount of water came down the Paluxy. That unusual flow of water washed away the soil that covered some of the tracks. Other tracks have been intentionally uncovered. For example, in one case, where a trackway went under a bank, several feet of the bank was removed to expose more tracks."
398,notsarc,"Well, again, the best resource I could think of is wikipedia, just do a few searches there (I suggest starting with ""Human evolution"") and I'm sure most of your questions will be answered. Bear in mind though that even this will only give you a basic overview. If you really want to go in depth, take a college course on evolution. Another good site would be TalkOrigins Archive: Exploring the Creation/Evolution Controversy"
399,notsarc,"You just provided good evidence that schools use an atheist presupposition - that atheism is entrenched in public schools. Who proclaims that man and chimps sharing a common ancestor is an established scientific theory? A theory is defined as a well tested explanation that unifies a broad range of observation. A theory has accepted principles. I know of no religion other than atheism - certainly not the Judeo Christian religion - that believe a creator made the common ancestor that man and chimps share. Since far more than half of US residents believe basically the creation account in Genesis, then there's not enough unification or acceptance of that ""theory"". That theory has a presupposition of abiogenesis, or a very similar non scientific basis. Another proof of the atheist entrenchment in public schools would be the organized efforts (largely of the teaching establishment) to keep ID out. "
400,notsarc,"Well, since you've called those who've disagreed with you here stupid (and variations thereof), and insinuated that they're too stoned to understand you, I think you have the most ground to make up. You also provide no support for your statements, most of which were debunked years ago as drug czar propoganda."
401,notsarc,"But the question is Can you prove your belief system is true? And all you've done is spew hate for religion but haven't even tried to actually answer the question. And ask yourself this. If the idea of God is such a man made plague, then God doesn't even exist right ? So if God doesn't exist then what has He done to you to make you so venomous and angry at him ? Why would you be so angry at a non existent being ? I challenge you to come up with a rational answer."
402,notsarc,"Though I know you directed this question at Cthulhu, I will nonetheless jump in to say that I would quickly choose the newborn mentally retarded baby to live and the zygote to die. That is obvious to me since the mentally retarded baby is a currently existing person vs. the zygote being merely a potential person. That zygote may have more potential for the future but the decision is being made in the present. I would feel far more guilt in sentencing a real person to die than in sentencing a potential person (now merely a cell) to die."
403,notsarc,"I think that what you two are doing is simply trading evidences. Saying someone is 'wrong' and directing them to a atheist web-site is not proof. You should merely be saying, 'here is an alternative argument'I say this because I can access a number of science posts that state the exact opposite of what you say, and show that they can find evidence for a flood."
404,notsarc,i meant betweent 1973-1986 because that was the cutoff date for people to vote in the last election
405,notsarc,Because that the law one has to presume and of course the law applied to that specific case. As to it being contradictory - well the law is loaded with contradictions if you look at all closely. On the other hand consider that the driver killed the woman AND obviously damaged her fetus beyond recovery - WITHOUT the consent of the woman. In other words the death of the fetus was not by consent of the person who holds the right to decide but rather by the negligence or intent of the guilty party.And yes prior to her death (assumming all other requirements were met) she could have AT HER CHOICE and UN-COERCED have chosen to abort the fetus without incurring a legal penalty. But that would of course be much different.
406,notsarc,"you're on the right track; the problem with evolution is that it has no verifiable creator -- the fact is, mutations (which supposedly add new raw material for selection) have never shown to add any new structure or even a new part to any existing structure. It's a sad fact for evos."
407,notsarc,"This is more of a legal question involving whether or not it was negligence(sp). If so, you can't really sue for amounts of money you MIGHT get in the future. He could sue for lost pay on the job and other medicial procedures. So ya know :). I don't really know what the question is."
408,notsarc,"Well, obviously.
 
 It possesses some form of intelligence that it is up to the Darwinists to identify, lest their theory will be further destroyed."
409,notsarc,"How right you are to,and given the forum here, make it a crime to own to own a gun,well I think most of us are automatically criminals.It's like the signs you see...SHOPLIFTERS WILL BE PROSECUTED!lot a good they do.emoticonXBanghead,yeah know matter how illegal their will be crime."
410,notsarc,"Not realy they are still being manufactured for civilian use and are legal in most states even in states where machine guns are not allowed. You would be actualy supprised at how available they are. You sign your life away and are no longer a name less face to the feds but you may be able to own one in your state. All thats needed is to get your chief law enforcment officer to sign your fourm 4, pay $200 to BATFE, pass an FBI back ground chk and wait appx. 2 mo's and you have one."
411,notsarc,"Actually we do not know who the first human to get AIDS was. Most likely it was an African who got it from a green monkey last I looked into the matter, most likely by eating the creature. You are perhaps referring to case zero, but thats only as far back as the chain can be traced, its not the first case in humans."
412,notsarc,But I think that Gods originally came about to explain why a large yellow thing goes up and down everyday. To a caveman the most logical explanation is there is a God. Now we know better. Just because there are still things we can't explain does not mean they must be from God.
413,notsarc,"It's all very interesting, but you left out a critical piece of information. You deliberately omitted the fact that most of the black victims were killed by fellow blacks. These weren't murders carried out by racist white guys, they're the examples of black on black violence."
414,notsarc,"Yes. But if you rephrased the question as ""Does evil exist independent of an observer with a cohesive values system?"", I'd say ""no"". That an event is regarded as evil requires a values system, but not necessarily theism."
415,notsarc,"And just what is the number of ""real scientists"" that acknowledge the good science behind creationist claims? And why is it that over 99% of the biologists in the U.S. accept evolution and reject classic creationism? You make statements that are patently untrue......."
416,notsarc,You yourself said you don't even know what the gun laws in California are. Yet you're saying there you believe they have legitimate tests?
417,notsarc,"Well in the opinion of supporters of that theory there has been evidence for their beliefs... Visions, UFO's, ...
 
 even though it is very doubtful, it would have to be respected in classes at school..."
418,notsarc,"Who has ever made this claim? Please, show me, because I have never once heard it. Of course most individuals are physically capable of producing offspring. Natural selection is dependant upon which individuals will pass their genetic information on to the next generation, and that is determined by at least two factors that I can think of at the moment: 1.) An individual being able to survive long enough to find a mate, and 2.) Actually being able to find a mate and produce offspring, which brings me to my next point:"
419,notsarc,You know what is far worse than murder itself? Executing people to save some money.
420,notsarc,"There are contradictions in the bible, for so the bible doesn't obey the law of non contradiction. As to the law of identity, Jesus is called both the ""Son of God"" and the ""Son of Man"", which means Also, many parts of the bible are taken as 'metaphors' - yet the law of excluded middle should prevent us from doing that.I'm sure someone will be able to refute my individual points, but on the whole the bible is not an entirely logical source.Furthermore, even if these laws were created by a God, this God does not have to be the same one described in any religion whatsoever. In fact, he doesn't have to be omnipotent, so he could even be dead - Atheists could state that God created these laws then died. In which case, God does not exist but Atheists have still accounted for the creation of said laws."
421,notsarc,If guns laws don't affect criminals then how do you explain the low rates of criminal gun use in nations like the UK?
422,notsarc,"Abortion is about pregnancy - and whether or a not a woman wants to be or can sustain a pregnancy - physically, emotionally and economically.Nobody has to be a parent. That is why there is adoption, safe-haven laws, the signing away of parental rights - and oh yes, an ever growing population of dead beat dads.I am still waiting to see proof of all the mourning dads due to women having abortions. Most of those women are desperate and alone - or have the blessing of the father."
423,notsarc,"Those cultures that permit multiple wives at least do have issues as a result, but hard to say they fail miserably. We are complex animals and not all animals mate for life. There is significantly more involved in the lifelong union of humans than reproduction. Multi-marry under the right circumstances works, but it isn't for everybody and even for those that it is for doesn't mean it's for them always. In a nutshell marriage is the biggest commitment any person will make and should be given the consideration and thought it deserves. Same sex marriage can cause a perfect union of two people the same as M/F and can make a mockery or marriage just as many M/F unions currently do. The emotional investment is the same, the responsibility and obligations are the same, the only difference is genitalia and a little more hair in some cases."
424,notsarc,You said who would it hurt? I'm asking you who would it hurt if there was prostituion? Just to help you think that there are injuries that are proximate to everyone.
425,notsarc,"I would suggest you look at the faero island mouse then. That is a new species, and it is not man doing it, but rather nature itself."
426,notsarc,They do not. They offer increased thermal protection and thus make a greater range of habitats possible. Feathers also offer increased protection from attack. They are so good that several native American cultures were known to make armor from feathers. They absorb and spread impact quite well.Feathers don't itch and they don't rustle in the bush.Do you have an answers that aren't examples of shallow thinking?
427,notsarc,"Well, it might be hard to convince people that you aren't ignorant of some of the facts, although it appears that you're not completely ignorant of all of the facts... On the other hand, only Christians might label you as ""anti-Christian"" for rejecting literalism."
428,notsarc,"I think often abortion is wrong but I do not agree with criminalizing it. Primarily the reasons that are used to justify criminilzation are hugely fallacious and secondarily because it won't do a thing that is positive. A woman who is determined to end her pregancy - will. Criminalization will simply make it extremely dangerous. I am responsible, have even had my tubes tied, but if I were to become pregnant and that pregnancy were the result of rape or a threat to my health or livlihood I would end it - and I will not be checking the law books first. Every woman has her line in the sand - abortion will go on regardless of its legal standing. There are a miriad of reasons seek abortion - comdemning those reasons does nothing (i.e. calling them selfish) - addressing them could help. The reasons are valid."
429,notsarc,"Because they knew full well that the bulk of the confiscated weapons never came from the United States!I don't see why we should care how many weapons couldn't be traced back to America even though they came across the border, because it's a moot point. The identifying marks don't exist on them if they can't be traced, meaning the whole thing is a non-issue for everybody except those who have an axe to grind and rights to try and destroy."
430,notsarc,"But she murdered her child.
 
 There are laws in Austrailia (and hopefully someday in the U.S.) against killing your pre-birth children."
431,notsarc,"Possibly, depends on what you read and by whom. Still, the war wasn't aganist slavery."
432,notsarc,"You have some good points here, but what do you do in the event of pregnancy due to rape? Or a pregnancy that is going to put the life of the mother at risk?And to push the line a bit further, what about failed contraception, where the 'morning after' pill is taken? Does that count as abortion as it happens after conception?Smiley"
433,notsarc,"But it's not detecting any ""new"" wavelength. It's just detecting a wavelength that our eyes are incapable of detecting. You can't see radio waves, so radio waves are meaningless to your eye, but they're not meaningless to your clock radio receiver."
434,notsarc,"**This is the line that caused me to butt in, walking-fish. Again, my apologies, but prs has no idea of the difference between Lamarckian and Darwinian theory, and how that theoretical difference would be reflected in different social theories. As far as I can tell prs has nothing but preconceived misconceptions about this. I felt compelled to speak up. Hope you're not put out about my intrusion."
435,notsarc,"I am so sorry to hear about what has happened to you. I hope you get away from this terrible man and surround yourself with people who love you.I must ask, though, why are you a Christian? You completely disagree with typical Christian sentiments on abortion, you feel none of the purported guilt the religious movement implies is inevitable, you feel like you did the right thing, so why would you continue to profess to belong to this religion if you disagree with one of the major issues of the day?"
436,notsarc,"And that (among a number of other reasons) is why I will probably never, ever live in the state of California. Personally I have no desire to live somewhere that won't let me take the means to adequately defend my family and myself, if necessary."
437,notsarc,Just have to say something on this. If the boy scouts didnt receive federal support and get special deals from the government then they would be able to exclude whoever they want. However since they often hold their meetings in public schools for free and rent public lands for discounted price or even sometimes for free they cannot discriminate against gays and atheists. So they have to make a choice.
438,notsarc,I have never said anything about not defending it through armed force. I just don`t believe that you need an armed populace.
439,notsarc,"I'm sure you haven't. But it is a worthy thread because of the reality that Islam ""is"" closing in on what we consider ""the free world"". If you love your freedom and the choices you now have, you should pay attention to Islam. They are consumed with a hatred for the west and are dedicated to their cause. Symbiote declares this the worst thread ever. It is unpleasant, but, Islam will not be denied. The numbers Cruiser provided mean a lot. Especially to progressives."
440,notsarc,I'm sorry but the baby is a part of both of them.Should it be that the mother decides to keep the baby and the father want's her to terminate the state will still come chasing for child support.Why the father didn't get a say on if the baby was born or not so why should he have to pay child supportbecause the law says so.
441,notsarc,"C.S.Lewis believes things on faith, yet we are to use his words, which he is not here to clarify, as evidence that my claim is false, when he obviously accepts the same illogical claim as premise?

""We're an accident? OMG, then we must right!""."

443,notsarc,"What if the surgery for transferring the embryo/fetus would be equal in difficulty, risk, etc. to having an abortion? There would then be no extra physical cost incurred in keeping the embryo/fetus alive. What would be the reasons, in such a case, to keep abortion as an option?"
444,notsarc,"Oh and let us not forget the wonderful couples of just a generation or two ago. Johnny Mathis and partner, Edwin August partner to Jack Kerrigan, Gareth Hughes, producer Ryszard Ordynski and play set designer George James Hopkins, stage actors Franklin Pangborn and Edward Everett Horton and oh so many more. Some were indeed wonderful, some were leturous playboys who moved with the ""Gay"" crowds. But never were they shunned or their careers ruined because of it. In fact, some of their careers flourished because of their associations."

(Except their own.)This same mother could be a person who didn't have access to pre-natal care. They wouldn't defend that right either.Because they DON'T care about the fetus. They don't care about life. They don't care about health. They care about power and money and pushing people around. That's all."
448,notsarc,"Not once have I said he is perfect. But when people criticize things that I either know are false or I don't agree with, I will back him up. Just like people back up Kerry. I will remember that when you try to defend anyone."
449,notsarc,"If same sex couples are offered equal rights under a PACS (or some other legally recognized union) as married couples, why does it matter which ""door"" they come in through?

450,notsarc,"I believe you can relinquish the child support responsibility if you also relinquish parental rights.Complicated stuff - kind of going through it right now as we are working on revoking my son's bilogocal father's parental rights. Once that is done I can not pursue him for support.Plus, plenty of dads do it the easy way, don't pay, don't care and disappear."
451,notsarc,"That's just not true. It is a logical fallacy. Evolutionary theory makes no claims to be able to recount every mutation, recombination, migration, random mating, or chance death of every organsim. But the evidence for evolution is beyond dispute. More than 99% of degreed biologists accept evolutionary theory as the best explanation for the observed data."
452,notsarc,"I don't think we have any business forcing anyone to do something they don't want to do. The father is supplying his DNA when he engages in sexual relations. After than point he has in effect signed a blank check. It's like the old saw, if you don't want to do the time, don't do the crime. Fathers to be shouldn't be engaging in sex unless they intend to pony up with the montly check. I come from a bit of a bias on this subject because this was my area of endeavor for some 20+ years."
453,notsarc,"The amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases (CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas) threatens to snowball because of the rapid depletion of available carbon sinks and the consumption of existing ones. The MAIN problem with de-forestations is NOT that the trees are no longer removing CO2 from the atmosphere, but our use of them is adding CO2 to it (burning, etc.) and the other sources we could turn to to remove it are also being used up. Methane hydrates in the polar seabeds threaten to rapidly increase the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases as soon as the temperature increases enough to destablize the ice crystals holding them in place."
454,notsarc,"The problem here is the translation from Hebrew to English. In Hebrew the translation was ""seven pairs"" in the English translation we wrote it as ""seven"". No contradictions there."
455,notsarc,Well it doesn't go against the US constitution...Does it go against the California constitution? I haven't seen much credible evidence for this..then again I don't know much about the California constitution. Do you?
456,notsarc,"Well, that's your own strong bias speaking. Many of the courts and scholars have disagreed with you."
457,notsarc,"If a square is opposite to a circle (and it isn't, by the way), then gas/liquid/solid must be opposites therefore you contain opposites (by your own argument), in that you contain elements that are in these 'opposite' states.

460,notsarc,"But if you actually take time to read the study that is posted on that website it appears that the claims of the NSPOF are doubtful, inconsistent with other studies, and likely biased in favor of people answering that they had used a gun to defend themselves. "
461,notsarc,"And are people in DC legally allowed to carry their guns with them in a concealed manner, having them readily available like the rest of us do in the country?Absolutely not. According to DC your rights don't extend past your home, and it barely even exists inside your home."
462,notsarc,"You asked where the line should be drawn in regards to weapons?How about where ownership and use of weapons does not violate the rights of others. Before you respons think about it. Do anything you want. If I don't violate anyone then what is the beef? If I don't break any laws or endanger anyone what is the beef?The safe storage and handling of cannon, cannon propellant, and cannon ammo is well known. They can be stored in places typical of homes without violating the rights of others. BTW a cannon is not a weapon. It is considered a 'firework' by the ATF. Ever see a civil war renactment? Lots of cannons? So yes having a cannon in your front yard does fly."

Good question plotter...Plotter: ""when did he create all the other planets, when did he create all the other stars and comets?""Gen. 1:14 And God said, ""Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to separate the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years, 15 and let them be lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth.""

468,notsarc,"They didn't. Simple as that.Now, let's look at the post you keep quoting (although it has already been addressed by others).First one, Job 40: 15-24, seems to describe a Hippo (possibly an elephant).As to the second one, please show me a fire breathing dinosaur and you'll be in business with your claim that they described dinosaurs. Otherwise, there'll be quite a bit of mocking and scoffing at their claim of fire-breathing creatures.Aside from the fire breathing thing, it sort of sounds like the Nile Crocodile or something of the sort."
469,notsarc,"**Excuse me, walkingfish, for butting in, but I'd like to reiterate my point to schuster that Darwin's theory of ""Natural Selection"" is just an outgrowth of an ancient social rationalization for unequal distribution political/economic power and privilege, (that is, social elitism, aristocracy and racism), falsely and anthropomorphically applied to non-human life."
470,notsarc,"And the reasons have been discussed at length and most of us agree about the mother's life being endangered or possibly in cases of rape and incest.........Where we disagree with you is unecessary abortions...such as for birth control, a headache on just and inconveniencce........You think any abortion is alright...We don't....."

Just as people who are dead and without mental existence do not have the ability to obtain rights, a collection of human cells without a mental existence cannot obtain rights. I also notice you have resorted to attacking other people's views rather than following the topic of the thread, which is to share YOUR views. emoticonXBanghead"
474,notsarc,"That's not entirely true. For example, a country that isn't already saturated with, say, handguns, would imo greatly suffer if handguns were suddenly legalised. Banning handguns in a country that is saturated already, is imo, idiotic.

475,notsarc,"I think they have more of a chance becasue, while many manage to delude themselves into believing that an unborn child is not a baby, it would be much more difficult to convince yourself that a crying baby isn't a baby. Even in the animal kingdom (which we are all part of) you see some animals hesitate to kill the young of their own species. Evne coyotes will not generally kill a pup (I have even seen a pack of coyoptes pass a domestic pup without killing it, though they could have. I am told this is because of the stubby nose, which shows the coyotes that it is, indeed, a puppy, even though it looks unfamiliar to them)."

478,notsarc,"But the difference is, if you take a swing and hit someone, or harm them in a worse way, you can get locked up for it. But no cop is going to bar the door to a chapel where you get married to a same-sex partner, and you won't be arrested afterwards. Yes, it's completely legal for you to do that, right now.Apples and oranges."
479,notsarc,"Yes because it is ""officially"" a life.Whether a person believes in life at conception or not they all agree it is life at birth and half way through life it is still life and right before death it is still life.If she does not want the child she can refrain from sex,use a contraceptive or abortion.If he does not want it he can refrain from sex (not likely for men),use a condom (not a guarantee to work),have surgery (hard to reverse) but that is it.So if he was to use a condom and get her pregnant she still has the last option."
480,notsarc,"I know something of philosophy, and feel free to use Kant to refute me. I did not say God is necessary for a moral code to exist, I said some sort of Supreme Being is necessary for a moral code to exist objectively outside the human mind.What is your support that we do not know whether it is a person or not morally? I tell you now, a fetus is not morally a person to me. There, you are refuted."
481,notsarc,So? There are other articles and books that do. Is your link the ultimate authority on the cause of crime?
482,notsarc,"Yes. I know of no one who agrees with all government policies, or all of the premesis that they're based on. But we do all agree (or at least almost all) that we need some method for forming those policies. Compromises must be made. A religious secularist could believe, for example, that if we allow religious beliefs to dictate policy than it's just a matter of time before general religious freedom is compromised for all but those who follow the religion of the ruling party. Rather than risk that they would think it an acceptable compromise to have some policies that they don't agree with, as long as they don't actively compromise their faith. "
483,notsarc,"Even new Justice Sotomayor, who claimed she ruled by precedent will be bound by the Heller Decision if she remains true to her purported philosophy. The debate between Sui Juris and Res Judicia should no longer be an issue with the liberals on this RIGHT! It either applies to all or it applies to none which would result as Justice W.O. Douglas wrote: ""a revolution"". It is in the government's (federal especially) best interests to keep our soldiers employed in foreign countries. BTW, I think the court decision in Nunn vs. State of Georgia did the best summation of this right!"
484,notsarc,"What?! Then how do we discount the Gospel of Thomas or any of the gnostic gospels? How are they wrong and the canonical gospels true? If historians held the ""it does not matter what the document contains"" standard, there'd be no knowing anything."

487,notsarc,Of course the bolshevik revolution was doomed from the start as Russia was not indsutrialised and the revolution was imposed by a minority of the bourgeoisie rather than a mass movement of the proletariat (not that there was a proletariat in Russia at the time).
488,notsarc,"Hey, as Collin said, P.Z. registered, and got it. I would say that booting him out is the height of hypocrisy. It confirms to be that it is based on a lie, and the producer knows it. The movie was making a claim that the 'opposition' was silencing I.D., and the presentation of alternate ideas. Yet, what do they do? They kicked someone out they INTERVIEWED for the movie (based on false pretenses to be sure, but they did pay him for appearing in the movie).That sounds that THEY are the ones trying to suppress opposing ideas, not science. Yes, they had the legal right. But, boy did it put egg on their face, considering everything. It shows them to be hypocrites and liars."
489,notsarc,You don't even take into consideration the possibility that Japan could have a higher mass murder rate- perhaps the same as the US- if guns were freely available in that country. You have a lot of explaining to do if you expect me to buy what you're trying to peddle. 
490,notsarc,I think you are on to something.The problem I see is that any proponent of a plan such as this will have toi take on both the health insurance lobby and the pharma lobby and their bottomless well of $$$ and propaganda.Here's hoping now that there's a new sheriff in town.
491,notsarc,"Yes. We all ask this question of creationists who propose that the universe was created out of nothing - poof! But science doesn't try to answer that question. We do know that the universe began expanding about 13.7 billion years ago. What went before that and the cause for the expansion isn't known and at present, and may never be knowable. However, we do know that particles can and do spring into existence from nothing, for no apparent reason. Google ""Casimir effect"" and read about one example. Wikipedia will probably be the 3rd entry. This something from nothing is an effect from the zero-point energy of a vacuum."
492,notsarc,"That's EXACTLY the point. Regardless of whether or not human minds think differently, whichever mind produced and agrees that 2+2=4 is absolutely correct, the rest are wrong. We know this because we can observe and test the concept in the physical world and prove that it is true. This goes for just about anything, dissention in the face of facts does not change the facts.IMHO, this invalidates your claim that something produced in the human mind is not absolute due to some human minds being contradictory."
493,notsarc,"Actually, the answer might depend more on the nature of the question, or the particular religious cult of the person being asked, etc. In questions of science, fundamentalists will tell you that the answer was revealed to them by their god in their holy scripture.On the other hand, you are characterizing religion as insanity. I think that you really mean that when religion is offered as science, then that is insane."

501,notsarc,"So everyone thinks that ""evolutionists"" should seize power or something? If that is true, it is because evolution is very widely accepted."

If we were able to prove so many scientific proceedures (from abiogenesis to radiometric dating - all based on the presupposition that there is no God) were indisputably true, then ID would be falsified. There is not enough supporting evidence for happenstance origins. Yet so much of happenstance origins is considered science, so all too often, there is no line between religion and science. "

512,notsarc,It may only be salvaging to you but to the parents involved it is body theft.Let me just ask you to step in our shoes for just 10 minutes imagine trawling around 100's of hospital labs and medical schools seeing all these poor little babies lined up in jars and i don't mean just a few there is up to 50 in each hospital and school imagine looking at those jars hoping that one of them is your child so you can at lastgive him the burial he/she deserves(a basic human right) yet at the same time praying that none of them are yours.Having done that can you still say that it is only salvage bearing in mind our children were only sent for post mortem and many of us have not seen them since?
513,notsarc,Obviously the correct thing to do is kill the zygote. The thing that bothers me about this whole thing is some of the people that said they would refuse to choose. This is characteristic of your typical wimpy religious copout and is nothing but a cheep avoidance tactic. These people are not the kind of people that should be making any important decisions that concern other people so I guess its just as well. A zygote is no more viable then a sperm. The attempt to call a zygote a living being is simply more evidence that the religious have no common sense.

516,notsarc,"sonar is more than that; it's a method of communication.http://dsc.discovery.com/news/briefs/20041025/bat.htmlWhenever females heard sonar sounds from another female, they would call less frequently, likely to tune in to what the other female was communicating. According to the researchers, female bats interact mainly with other females in complex hierarchies during their lives, so that could be why they take more of an interest in echolocation sounds from their own sex......She told Discovery News, ""The connection of the two studies is in the idea that bat communication is more complex than previously documented, since research is finding a variety of social calls to be communicating territory defense and mate attraction, as well as sonar calls, previously thought to only function in prey capture and navigation, to also have a communication role.""

And if it's science then it must be right, right ? emoticonXRolleyes"
519,notsarc,"Now you're being ridiculous. The big bang is not the evolution of the universe. The words ""evolution of the universe"" do not necessarily entail the big bang. For example, brane theory offers an alternative theory to explain the evolution of the universe.But claiming that the ""evolution of the universe"" is part of the theory of evolution is somewhat like claiming that because Kate Hudson has achieved stardom, she is producing vast amounts of energy through hydrogen fusion. Why is it that creationists believe that every word has only a single meaning?By the way, I have always heard the creationist invention ""GTE"" referred to as the General Theory of Evolution - you know, as if there is some relation to the general theory of relativity."
520,notsarc,"Well, there is now string theory, which has grown into M-theory, which may have a rational answer (at least a mathematical one). But calling it a theory is really a misnomer.

521,notsarc,I don't find it surprising. It's probably a strategic sacrifice on their part rather than a change in their personal views . They don't want to lose votes and possible support from gun owners for their priorities like health care reform because of a difference of opinion on gun control policy. They know that the Republicans are going to hit them with everything they've got during election time and exaggerated accusations about the Democrats wanting to take away people's guns would hurt them. The Republicans learned during the Clinton years that creating as much as paranoia as possible about the Democrats supporting big government is the way to regain a majority in Congress. It's all politics.

524,notsarc,"So according to one of the people who conducted the study don't go using their results as a tool for arguing against abortion.One woman I know had an abortion a short time after she was married. I also know she has regrets that she had the procedure. I considered what she had to say about her experience and thought about the 14 year old son she now has. From what she told me, I could plainly see she would never have had her son if she had not had her abortion as her circumstances would have changed beyond recognition. Perhaps she gets depressed about the child she never had because of her abortion. However, her son is a fantastic boy whom she loves very much. So we cannot simplify in quite the way you seem to infer that we can."
525,notsarc,"Anti abortion people want to take a womens right to an abortion away period. Would you force someone to get a sonagram of a tumor and be forced to look at it and think ""do I really want to have this tumor removed?"" That is exactly what a fetus is and for some women that is how it is viewed."
526,notsarc,The only reason why that makes no sense is that no one exists inside the embryo. It would be like writing about someone weeding their garden from a weeds point of view. The anthropomorphization of non-mental existant beings is implausible at least.
527,notsarc,"Again, name one that is presented in high school. In fact, name several since you seem to think that there are several. And it really doesn't matter how many times you squeal about how you aren't talking about YEC, you are. You have been duped and you didn't even know it was going on. Why do the people of Kansas elect scientific illiterates to make decisions about science education. Why did they pay a panal of 27 scientists and science educators to write science standards, and then throw them out?"
528,notsarc,"What do you mean by other definitions? Before you stated ""Creation is...."" thus it is implicit in this that you are arguing against a single homogonous construct. And it's embarrassing for you to realise that there's actually as much variance of opinion in this, as in evolution."
529,notsarc,"Private guns were completely private. They were personal property and could not be seized. It was the man that carried the weapon who was required to provide service, and required to provide his own weapon. Since the enrollment and inventory requirements were specifically to ensure that every man had his own private rifle, shot, powder, kit to fight with, it would seem rather stupid to worry that it was infringing on peoples right to bear arms, wouldn't it? Contrast this with today, where registration schemes have been used in places like new york to provide lists for seizure or surrender of firearms. In the one case, you have a law that is meant to insure that everybody has a weapon, i the other, it is a law determined to limit the accessibility of weapons. You really don't see the difference here?"
530,notsarc,"Because natural selection works on a cost/benefit basis. For bats and whales and cave-dwelling birds echolocation confers huge advantage, allowing them to exploit niches closed to competing species. For ground- or tree-dwelling terrestrial animals, it would be of marginal or zero benefit, given the 'noise' in their immediate surroundings."
531,notsarc,"HA wouldnt you say someone who is really overweight actually has more of a problem with stress on their joints, muscels, heart, and bladder than a woman carrying a small child in her womb? Obesity can demand major scarifices in behavior and diet. Some of which can be detrimental.I really dont see your point because this isnt just a woman's problem when it comes to these issues you pointed out.And im not really sure what a ""pregnancy"" is according to you.. please explain.. When i hear the word pregnant, i think of 2 people, not just 1.Also, the baby has its own blood, its own immune system, and contains its own calories once consumed. theres nothing that the mother has that the baby doesnt other than it just needs nutrtion. Just like you need food everyday."
532,notsarc,"so if cells are controlled by their genes (and the environment), what would you predict would happen to the cell if its genes were removed?"
533,notsarc,"Actually, society hasn't said this. 5 judges, in very recent times, have. I for one think that some 17 year olds fully comprehend the full implications of murder, and therefore should be held accountable in the same way as an 18 year old. I guess I just don't see any reason why a jury could not address the issue on a case by case basis. I do not see the ""18 and over execution rule"" in the eighth amendment."

538,notsarc,"So you see, Brady, you're wrong again. The McDonald ruling wasn't an issue of guaranteeing white men their ability to feel safe in the face of growing minority groups. Quite the opposite. The McDonald ruling was about striking against those with racist and evil intentions who would use the law to render innocent people helpless for no good reason. It was as much about protecting minorities from harm as anything."
539,notsarc,"For years I've tried to get one of our resident gay members to debate me on that fact. To date, no takers. Want to step up?"
540,notsarc,Rarely has truth ever supported one side of a political movement.
541,notsarc,Because the modern application of gun control is to target everyone. But that doesn't change the fact that gun control began as a purely racist concept.
542,notsarc,"think of it as a photocopy of a check for a million dollars. yes the copy is in the image and likeness of the original check, but it is not the check. you cannot cash the photocopy, regardless of how accurate the copy is, it is not the check, only an image of it. that doesn't mean anything is ""wrong"" with the original, and it doesnt mean that the copy has to have all the properties and function of the original. its just an image"
543,notsarc,"The logic we use to make statements about reality is derived from the way we observe material things behaving, and that logic is not immutable. Quantum physics demonstrates the fundamentally uncertain nature of reality at very tiny scales: the 'law of excluded middle' in particular taking it firmly in the shorts. Given that logic can vary on such a simple metric as physical scale, your argument is starting to look more than a bit frayed at the edges :)"
544,notsarc,"I think there are some things they will habitually avoid discussing.
 After a while, even Archie realizes the claims he makes that are no-brainer false."
545,notsarc,"What you are talking about here is the *potential* to exist being important. I would personally also thinking that potential existence is important, but not nearly as important as an existing person. After all, unfertilized eggs and sperm also have the *potential* to become full people but no one is concerned about their loss. For many of us it is the actual mentally-existing person that is most important. For both the 'braniac"" case you present and for the early term fetus, if there is no reason to kill it, then don't. However, if there is a contest between the rights of a living, existing person and the rights of either *potential* person, then I think the rights of the living person win out."
546,notsarc,"Actually, if you want to check, you will find that biologists themselves will point out the holes. We still have a lot to learn. Many of the holes have been closed even in my lifetime and the creationist god-of-the-gaps is being reduced to smaller and smaller gaps. But if you want a creationist to ""join the real world"", you're going to have to do more than be offensive and insulting. You might present some actual facts to support your position. Of course, I presume that you will actually educate yourself before presenting the facts.Have a nice day."
547,notsarc,"This is just plain dumb. Abortion is NOT the primary means of birth control. If it is used as birth control, it's because others have failed or haven't been tried."
548,notsarc,"It's even worse than that. He isn't asking for info on how it works; if he was I would supply it gladly. He claims to already know that it's wrong, which implies that he thinks he knows what it's about. But despite already knowing what carbon dating is, he still needs someone here to provide an explanation before he can present his ""proof"" that it's incorrect. As Akbar says, ""It's a trap!"""

They've got their own arms manufacturing plants over there, they can make whatever they need or want."
554,notsarc,"Yes that is a problem. But there is an instance when the 2nd Amendment did protect the USA from invaders:""Someone at the table asked a Japanese admiral why, with the Pacific Fleet devastated at Pearl Harbor and the mainland US forces in what Japan had to know was a pathetic state of unreadiness, Japan had not simply invaded the West Coast"" - http://www.backwoodshome.com/articles2/ayoob70.htmlIf it wasn't for the 2nd Amendment you would be speaking Japanese if you live on the West coast, German if you live on the East coast."

Alito is far too intelligent to be logically trapped by a buffoon such as Shumer.It is also plain to see he interrupts when he supposes the response will indeed make sense against his flailings."
556,notsarc,"In 2000, the U.S. recorded close to 11,000 firearm homicides and more than 16,000 firearm suicides. The European Union -- an area with a population approximately 25% higher than that of the U.S. -- reported fewer than 1,300 firearm homicides for the same year. In Japan, the number was 22.sinjin - The US firearm homicide rate is more than 180x that of Japan."
557,notsarc,"Do you have any evidence for that? And still, I don't know what you mean by kind."

561,notsarc,You blame others for your failure to understand the basics.
562,notsarc,"Yet he hasn't. No pro-choice person I know wants abortion to be prevalent, they just want it to be an option. Wanting it safe and rare and available is not an abnormal positon for a pro-choice person."

I'd like to think that she does care about the moral concerns of most people in the nation, but it's starting to become more and more apparent that may not be the case.At the rate they are going, gay rights people in this country are going to bring a constitutional amendment on themselves before they truly realize the value of actually trying to see the issue through someone's eyes other than their own, and actually dialoging rather than trying to dictate their views onto the nation. By then it will be too late."

Did you know that the same percentage of children that were brought up by gay couples turn out to be gay as children who are brought up by straight couples? I would say that destroys your conception that the kid would be confused.I know a number of people who were brought up by commited gay couples (admittedly not many), and not one of the ones I know turned out to be gay."

572,notsarc,"So, if there was a way to know that that baby would be infertile it would be alright in your view to abort?"
573,notsarc,"here we go Dan. your problem with the law is not whether its fair or not, its whether you can benefit personally from it. you have no problem with abortion because your not going to be the victim of such a law, but youd definitely have a problem if you were the one suffering from the law. Apparently you dont care if the law disadvantages or is unfair to others, as long as it doesn't hurt you, you're OK with it."
574,notsarc,"Yes, it does. Read it all. Also go to this link where an Israeli citizen talks about guns and gun-control in Israel. http://www.counsel.net/chatboards/2n....02.36.24.htmlSounds like Israel has strict gun-control laws but also lots of guns. Gun-control has not led to gun confiscation in that nation."
575,notsarc,"But there is no evidence that it did not come about by natural processes. And, there is, in fact, evidence of natural processes that may have resulted in life. Just because you don't understand it doesn't make it so."

577,notsarc,"You/he could just have said 'slippery slope' in the first place; that argument is an old one, which I though was dealt with a long time ago. You can't disapprove of A on the grounds that it might lead to B - firstly because you have little to no evidence that it will, secondly because A is not necessary for B to happen and thirdly because that difference between A and B is all the argument you need to prevent B but be in favour of A. You can approve of punishing criminals but be against the death sentance."
578,notsarc,Actually true. But I fail to understand the point. mtDNA from Neandertals seems to indicate that they are not ancestral and did not interbreed with modern humans. Neither are mammoths ancestral to modern elephants. In both cases the evidence indicates that they are related species. What was your point?
579,notsarc,"Mythology. But nevertheless, shipbuilding has been going on for a lot longer than 500 years. There have been a lot of skilled shipbuilders who have passed along their knowledge from generation to generation. Do you think that every time someone builds a ship that they invent the whole process? Nah. 300 ft is about the limit for wood no matter how you design it. Even worse it you cast a big box adrift in a huge storm. How did the animals survive the rolling and rolling?"
580,notsarc,"You know what they mean, I know what they mean, but as someone involved in teaching evolution to high school kids I wish they'd avoid the implication of purposeful change and just refer to beak size changing in response to new selective pressure.As I said, I may just be being nit-picky. Language apart, this is another nice example of evolutionary change happening right before our eyes."
581,notsarc,I believe you have even debated that it is conditioned into humans to be religious and therefore it validates religions. So why is there a need to debate whether animals love if they are acting on a conditioned response?
582,notsarc,"End the guessing right now. Don't guess. The meaning of the 2nd Amendment is explained in two documents: 1) The Militia Act of 1792 and 2) Federalist Papers #29. Both of which was written by the same Congress and same men who wrote the 2nd Amendment, the Constitution, and established the political philosophy of our country.First the Militia Act states WE AREA ALL IN THE MILITIA and that all citizens bring thier own weapons. - http://www.constitution.org/mil/mil_act_1792.htmThe more broader philosophy and intent of the 2nd Amendment and the Militia Act is further explained in the Federalist #29. - http://federalistpapers.com/federalist29.htmlThese documents are the thoughts and intent of the men who wrote the 2nd Amendment. So gun control slime are guessing or trying to reinvent history when they think gun ownership is collective. None of these documents anywhere support the collective idea."
583,notsarc,"The terrorists saw it as absolutly necessary. Personally, I disagree. When we kill children in Iraq, we see it as absolutly necessary, call it a horrible side effect of war. I disagree on that, too, I don't think it is necessary at all."

Yet you defend the very gun control laws that the gun haters want!How are you defending the right to bear arms if you want the very same gun control laws as the gun haters?
585,notsarc,"Cite the books. As far as I know, the evolution of the peppered moths is used as an example of natural selection. You don't seem to have understood. Again, cite the books. None I ever used ever claimed that it was proof of evolution."

587,notsarc,"Socialism is a very broad category of political ideals, which particular form were you thinking of?And just so you know, Fascism is not a form of socialism in any way. Socialism does not have oppressive governments. The purpose of socialism is to remove the class differences in society, if there is a small group of bureaucrats enforcing their will on the workers then that's a class difference."
588,notsarc,And I don't expect you to. The reason you won't go into how all men were created equal during reconstruction is because you cannot prove that all men are not created equal.
589,notsarc,"No no; again, you don't get it. He's only struggling because of people like you who deny the obvious.

590,notsarc,"Really? Why? Bacteria don't need to see to exist. They don't depend on light to live. In fact, bacteria thrive in dark, moist areas. Why would natural selection determine this ability as being advantageous?

Back in Jan '03 the UK government finally came clean and announced that they had been seriously fu**ing with crime statistics.You can make the argument that the UK state had something to hide with guncontrol and you would probably be right. Reliable information from UK ministries should now be accepted as less than credible."

However, if she doesn't want to support the violinist in that future, she has the responsibility to disconnect from (and therefore kill) that brainless body before the brain gets transplanted. Otherwise, if she waits to disconnect until it is too late, she would be guilty of killing the violinist (a person)."

Of course, Brady, you offer no evidence of how widespread individual firearm ownership became in the 5 years before Hitler rose to power when it became legal to possess firearms again. One would think that your argument would have at least considered this factorbut I wont fault you because all you have done is borrowed an un-sourced argument. Brady, this is just more cut and paste, this time largely from the website guninformation.org. For example, the statement "

It is SOP for cops to say this with every ticket which requires a signature. And these cops said it to her also. She's either stupid or was looking for any lousy excuse to refuse to cooperate, and then justify her refusal to cooperate with them which is why the Court rejected her argument and threw out her case ala they upheld her conviction and nullified her attempt to unlawfully enrich herself over an issue which she caused herself.

637,notsarc,"Well if it saves my life what is the problem??
 
 Aren't we pro life here?????"
638,notsarc,"If you literally mean ""kill,"" then you are right. However, many pro-lifers use ""kill"" as a synonym for ""murder."" Given the strength of your rhetoric, I assumed that you were a pro-lifer equating the choice of abortion with a choice of murder, which is an unsupported controversial assertion. If you meant that a choice to abort is a choice to kill, regardless of the moral status (murder or non-murder) of that particular act of killing, then I agree with you, although I'm not sure why you bothered to say it."
639,notsarc,"And from this we are to infer that Leakey doubts human evolution? There is by now a huge variety of fossil hominids. If Leakey was admitting that it was difficult to be certain which were or were not directly ancestral to modern humans, this is no more than scientific honesty."
640,notsarc,The goal of anti-abortionist is clear. The job of self restraint is that of each participant in their close encounters.
641,notsarc,"But the belief that 'its gotten us far' is itself a 'scientific' type belief, in fact it has less proof on the empirical assumptions than the science itself. Justifying the validity of experience by experience is the intellectual equivalent of saying'God must exist, because God is good and would not allow a world without God'."
642,notsarc,"I think according to your logic that the man ought to have the right to force the woman to have an abortion. If abortion is a legitimate means for her to rid herself of the responsibilities of parenthood, then abortion is likewise a legitimate means for a man who desires to rid himself of the responsibilities of parenthood. You have failed to show why this isn't the case. You have merely made a statement unsupported by any reasons."

644,notsarc,"It's interesting that you mention this because this was actually prophesied right from the beginning by God. Down through the centuries, women have been mistreated and often considered to be second-rate humans. This is because of imperfection, an imperfection that God could foresee:Your craving will be for your husband, and he will dominate you. (Genesis 3:16)Obviously men are not without blame too, but ultimately, due to disobedience to God, both Adam and Eve have had to pay the price and so have their offspring."
645,notsarc,"I looked it up and apparently there is a synthetic form of THC on the market, (generically known as Dronabinol and sold under the trade name Marinol). But it is only allowed under restricted prescription (it's a Schedule II controlled substance, the same as morphine or cocaine) and is far less effective than plant-derived THC."
646,notsarc,The empire you defend is tyrannical. They are responsible for the death of millions.

648,notsarc,"While I'm still iffy on her with the whole New Haven case, and her off-the-bench comments on race, this is one thing I commend her for and agree completely with."
649,notsarc,"Well, the simple answer to this question is ""No it is not."" Telling convention to shove it is not one of the main points of being gay, not in any way shape or form. Being gay is simply about the people one is attracted to, the people one loves, and the person one wants to spend his or her life with.Now this does not mean that these people do not tell convention to go shove it, but they do so only when they believe convention is unfair, unjust, unequal, and a detriment to happiness. On the issue of gay rights, most (but maybe not all) gay people believe that the specific convention of denying some rights to gay people is a bad one, so they stand against it. They do not simply hate convention because it is convention; good convention is worth retaining."
650,notsarc,"Actually the kid was on a panel, all pretty much saying the same thing. 
 
 Why didn't YOU cite them?"
651,notsarc,"Well, there's also carbon dating... Didn't you post something about a decay curve? Are you now going to deny the accuracy of that?"
652,notsarc,"I know you're talking to Jessica, so I will only comment on this. It would be easier to make it rare if pro-life people weren't intent on making it illegal. Pro-choice people have to make it as available as possible to counter pro-life attempts to shut it down entirely.If pro-life people didn't exist, then the reasonable people could work towards making abortion rare.Take the current debates for example. My entire point is that it should not be illegal. That abortion should be available as a safe and legal choice (it can only be really safe if it's legal). We spend all our time and effort debating the legality that we spend no time on creating programs to help women choose to continue their pregnancies instead of having an abortion, legal or not."
653,notsarc,They still have a lower rate of unwanted preganacies than the USA.
654,notsarc,"Yes, but how do you legally get it into international waters? Once there, where do you go? There aren't too many ports where ordinance is allowed. Since I am a law abiding citizen, where, other than international waters, may I legally have a gun?"
655,notsarc,"""True"" is not a good use of language to describe opinion. With regard to his opinion, I think he makes some good points, so I don't really need to ask him if its true. You on the other hand do need to speak to Olsen as you are claiming his letter rubbishes the concept of evolution- an opinion I hazard he would very much disagree with."
656,notsarc,That's not quite right. More accurate would be: Nothing that occurs outside the realm of physical law is in the realm of science. Science by no means precludes the possibility of there being something outside the realm of science.
657,notsarc,This is a push to promote lawlessness. The San Francisco fiasco is the prime example. People with certain agendas are refusing to follow the laws. This is a devastating precedent for our Nation.
658,notsarc,"Its odd that you would use that concept at all. Do you really think terms used to describe power structures in human organizations are applicable to cells and their subsystems? Genes are the heritable information store of cells, they perform their function, other subsystems perform other functions. The whole constitutes a living cell. The whole who is on top thing is an inapplicable concept. What counts is understanding the functions of the various subsystems. A cell is not a dominance heiracrchy."
659,notsarc,"But behind that are deeper, more fundamental issues about what homosexuality IS and the morality of it. To many people who view homoseuxality as immoral, your movement seems to be trying to write immorality into law."
660,notsarc,"Actually in high school I had a friend who used to be in placement. He was sixteen years old an he said he got the s*** beat out of him by an eight year old boy. ""Street kids"" get their XXX beat every day, pain is nothing new to them. It seems they're immune to it. It doesn't matter how hard you can hit, if you can't take a punch, then you can't call yourself street-worthy."
661,notsarc,The situation has nothing to do with chance. People don't have to draw cards to figure out who is going to have to kill themselves.
662,notsarc,"or just ship it to a frend where it is legal to sell it your self, a legal gun is more expensive than an illegal."
663,notsarc,"Nope. Not part of evolutionary theory. It would be stupid to claim that increased genetic variability would ""disallow"" any portion of the population from breeding."
664,notsarc,"I do not understand why people are stuck in this mindset that we have to define ALL abortions as either right or wrong. In between, there is the option of calling abortion under certain circumstances as right or wrong or calling abortion in certain trimesters as right or wrong. Why limit yourself to the extreme views? I do not believe that the original post asked for an absolute answer, just a survey of opinions. After all, as you say, abortion is not math and there is no one answer that everyone might agree with. However, the question of people's opinions on the beginning of personhood and how it relates to the morality of abortion lies at the very core of the debate on abortion rights. Really ... what other question is more relevant?"
665,notsarc,Perhaps it was an allegorical/metaphorical reference to abiogenesis that creationists just haven't understood.
666,notsarc,"ToE is a mechanistic theory -- it says life is like a machine. Machines aren't intelligent, they just do what they're made/programmed to do. Darwinists say lifeforms do what they do because of the way their particular genes program them. This is basic stuff.....yet you come along and say this isn't so. So which is it? Is life intelligent or not? If it is intelligent, what is illogical about believing life was designed intelligently by an intelligent designer? The intelligence had to come from somewhere. Where did the information in the DNA code come from?"
667,notsarc,They rarely date fossils anymore...instead they look at the strata of earth the bones were found in.
668,notsarc,"I believe such amendments cannot be pushed retroactively for them, so their marriages will stand (Something with US contitution code not allowing things like that to be retroactive)."
669,notsarc,"No I shouldn't be fighting against abiogenesis, I'm for unrestricted freedom to explore it all!"
670,notsarc,"Yeah, see this is the old ""gateway drug"" fallacy.If anything is a gateway drug, it's alcohol, so why is it still legal?If a drug can act as a ""gateway"" to other drugs, isn't that why it's illegal?So are people sitting around drinking alcohol all day, waiting for someone to come by with something ""harder""? No, and the same is true for people who smoke pot. Oh, sure they may also do other things once and a while, but it wasn't simply because they tried that first joint. It's just a personality trait and a common one. If pot didn't exist, these people would be doing something else. The same with alcohol and cigarettes. If they didn't exist, people would find some other type of vice."
671,notsarc,"I'm saying that if we assume reports that don't fit with science aren't true, then we can't use the filtered evidence to prove science is always true. Just like if I rejected as impossible any reports of Christians killing people and then said 'therefore Christians don't kill people'. The conclusion is made certain by the methodology."
672,notsarc,"Then for you, you made the right decision at the time. I'd personally have been leary of not getting to work or go to school easily from the doctors statements, especially in regards to keeping the child."
673,notsarc,"Well that was a good start. Are you planning on insulting everyone who replies to your post?Of course it would be more difficult for criminals to get hold of guns if there were fewer of them around. It would also make it more difficult for children to get hold of them, or feuding neighbours who, on the spur of the moment, think that waving a gun around might bring about a solution to their problems.If you don't think you're going to like the answers to your question, then don't ask the question.Smiley"
674,notsarc,"Well, if some of the implications of quantum theory are correct (and don't quote me on this), then some of those things are actually possible. However, as any scientist worth his/her salt will tell you, just because something is possible doesn't mean it's definite. I don't see any proof of those things happening any time soon, either, but they're fun to think about, aren't they?"
675,notsarc,"Nope. And since the melanic form is the dominant allele, your point is moot."
676,notsarc,"No I am saying a human being. Human is VERY diffent from human being. The hair that is in the drain of my shower is ""human."" It has the DNA charicteristics that make me and it human. My arm is human. It also has human characteristics. The question is, is it a ""human being"" with rights and interests, that was my point. "
677,notsarc,"In my reading of the Declaration (and using the 1st. Amendment as a filter) it doesn't matter who or what the founders meant by ""Creator."" The conlusion is the same; regardless. Namely; The fact that the founders considered our basic rights to be inherrent."
678,notsarc,"But himps living in the jungle were in competition with other himps which didn't migrate to the plains. And pressures from predators, climate and changes in the ecosystem should have continued to force the need or desire to control their environment as our line of himp grew to do. My point is that with all of the same basic tools to start out with such as fingers, opposable thumbs and walking upright, there is no reason why only our line evolved to the level that human beings have attained with the same hundreds of millions of years, and the same pressures pushing us all forward, or towards extinction."
679,notsarc,"They have changed. For example, ancient examples of coelacanth were shallow water species, while the modern coelacanth is a deep marine species (actually, two or three species). And the differences are enough to put them in different families.By the way, ark guy, what do you know about taxonomy?"
680,notsarc,"Cahuella,The Crusades (for the most part) were a justified reaction to Muslim aggression.

That's why it distinguishes an order of morality with degrees of goodness and badness. That's why a war may be permissable but an abortion is not.Parcum, glad to see you back. I was wondering where you had gone."
681,notsarc,Honest question Arch: where is the problem with a potential variance of 10 billion years? I know this question may appear ridiculous to you but could you take the question in the spirit it was meant?
682,notsarc,Apples and oranges. We're not demanding that they have abortions either.
683,notsarc,Not afraid of anything... I want them and buy them because I CAN. They all have different uses and history I collect some of them for that reason.
684,notsarc,"Yes I disagree with that point. The navy, just like the police, can't possibly be everywhere that danger might raise its ugly head. Merchant ships can't afford a 24/7 navy escort anymore than the average citizen can afford to hire body guards 24/7.There's no legitimate reason why merchant ships should be unarmed and unable to address dangers that deliberately come after them."
685,notsarc,"The evidence shows that reptiles did give rise to birds, but nothing shows monkeys became humans. Monkeys are far to evolved in their own way to give rise to us."
686,notsarc,"If putting the child up for adoption, this can be covered too. However, you havingto take time out per doctors instructions is something you might not desire as it could affect career opprotunities in certain lines of work."
687,notsarc,"Preganancy should not be used as a punitive measure against women who are sexual. What you think is not reflective of the reality of women and their cicumstances that exist in the world. The reasons to abort are numerous and complicated. Some reasons are more valid than others. But you have no way of knowing that for millions of women, only they can really know.And although there are some youngsters in this forum who negate life experience, it is not to be negated. Ther is a lot to be said for ""walking in a mile in another's shoes"". Be careful about your desire to take the life circumstances of a stranger in your hands. Are you ready to be morally cuplable for the damage you could do?"
688,notsarc,"Here's a question; which one split from the other? Which one is the ""new"" being? None of them are. If I get a cake and slice into two exact pieces, which one is the ""new"" slice? They are both equally new."
689,notsarc,"Even Darwin objected to the use of the phrase ""survival of the fittest"" in refering to his theories. He never used the phrase before the 4th edition of ""Origin"" and then he never used it without also making a reference to natural selection."
690,notsarc,"Yes, I certainly did consider these risks, and the risks at the time were far higher for continuing pregnancy than getting an abortion."
691,notsarc,Evolution wasn't introduced until 1859. When did abortion become popular?The industrial revolution occurred in the 1800s. Maybe that was the cause of abortion's alleged popularity.Grover Cleveland was elected in the 1800s. Clearly he had something to do with the alleged increase in abortion's popularity.The American Civil War occurred in the 1800s. It must have been the impetus for the rise in popularity of abortion.A human embryo does have features that look like gill slits. They are not gills but pharyngeal clefts. No modern book presents any information that human embryros have gill slits as if it is fact.
692,notsarc,Homo-erectus and Neandertals had different bone structures. How could they be fully human when their anatomy is fundementally different?
693,notsarc,"Actually, I think Kronos is right in this case--at least from the standpoint of most consitutional scholars. Of course the framers didn't envision the wording to be used in this way for this purpose--this is what's simply called a ""loophole"", in this case anyway. It's why there has been an effort in recent years to close the loophole with a constitutional amendment defining marriage."
694,notsarc,"So the initial murder wasn't enough to show ""that they are willing to commit acts of violence""? This makes absolutely no sense."
695,notsarc,"ZERO. I don't think he ####ed one African. Unless you can demonstrate otherwise, your statement is false."
696,notsarc,"Yes, but if seen from space (something the ancients couldn't do) it LOOKS like it hangs on nothing. Don't worry, I don't mind spelling it out for you."
697,notsarc,"In older times man had more questions without answers than today. Some men believed if a God of fire because they did not understand what fire was. Because of their misunderstanding they invented an answer, the Fire God. Today we know exactly what fire is and we don't need to invoke some mythical explanation. Today's atheists know that there are many other questions we don't have answers for and it's OK to simply say we don't know instead of buying into the whole ""let's-invent-some-god-to-explain-it"" mentality...."

Since the typical mother gave birth to between five and eight children, her lifetime chances of dying in childbirth ran as high as 1 in 8. This meant that if a woman had eight female friends, it was likely that one might die in childbirth."""
699,notsarc,"Really, fetal persons are born. Science has demostrated that birth really occurs into the womb, not when one leaves it."
700,notsarc,"Why can't you answer questions directly?anyway, I support ct in passing civil unions or marriage lite as I like to see it, but It doesn't confer equality. If it is really equ8al than it would be marrige. Reason beinbg portablity ( irealize you think that some day we might have that, but we don't so far and we cannot ccontrol other countries who may have gay marriage but not cilvil unions and may not recognize civil unions but recognize marriage.)If it is good for straight couples, it should be equally good for all couples. . No one is more superior. Everyone should be equal. Marriage for all is equals."
701,notsarc,"There is never a question of ""killing people"" in such circumstances, it a matter of deciding if treatment should be withdrawn and thus allow them to die, i.e. where there is no possibility of any sort of a recovery."
702,notsarc,Actually it would be impossible for the monblock to spin. There is NO PLACE OUTSIDE OF IT from which to observe! Any observer would necessarily be inside the budding universe - no place else to go you see. Indeed its still impossible for us to know whether the universe as a whole is spinning or not!!!! Sorry I was being a bit ironic thinking you would see the point. Guess not though.
703,notsarc,"I think your idea has merit. However, before I would fully endorse it, I am interested in how you see it being implemented and administered from the standpoint of equal protection under the law."
704,notsarc,"Pregnancy involves risk. While opting to undertake risk for a worthwhile objective is fine, to compel someone to take that risk is not. Obviously some pregnancies are undesirable, when unplanned or especially when the result of rape or incest. Besides, something that almost any woman can do is hardly a ""miracle"". Wondrous maybe but miraculous?"
705,notsarc,Really? Show me that by quoting where the article says it.
706,notsarc,"Since when are profetallifers ""reasonable people""?
 
 How reasonable can it be for them to try to impose their particular answer to a metaphysical question on others who believe differently?"
707,notsarc,"That is about the same for me (although I never went to church), and I find it more of an intellectual stimulation, and I can learn a lot too"
708,notsarc,"Yep. But our ancestors lived in an area of abundant fruit, and we got all we needed from our diets, so it was no big thing when the gene broke. A few non-primate organisms also have it broken, but it's broken in a different way.Barbarian observes:It's remarkable then, how much progress we've made. You may or may not approve of the theory, but it works very well at learning more about biology."

710,notsarc,"Because Africa isn't one big homogeneous ecosystem. There are jungles, plains, deserts, swamps. Himps living in the jungle weren't in competition with himps that started migrating out onto the plains. Their food sources are different, their territories are different. The more suited to plains-dwelling we became, the less attractive a prospect it was to return to the jungle. Pretty straightforward, really."
711,notsarc,"Far too simplistic to be called accurate, there is some truth in this."
712,notsarc,"Actually, with more data that changes the number of assumptions required, it is possible to reach a greater degree of certainty about something. The greater degree of certainty you reach, the better you will be able to apply your findings."
713,notsarc,"Again, I don't know what happenstance origins are, but ruling something out because it's unlikely doesn't work. I have made the poker analogy very often. If you are dealt in order, the 3 of spades, then the 5 of hearts, then the 9 of clubs, then the 4 of diamonds, then the 6 of hearts, would you decide immediately that it was not true? The odds are (1/52)*(1/51)*(1/50)*(1/49)*(1/48) = 1/311,875,200.This could be done for multiple games. The odds get slimmer and slimmer, but the difference is that something had to happen. No matter what cards you got, the odds of you getting the same card in that order would be this slim."
714,notsarc,"Actually I did not know what Nato had posted. I found it quite interesting. I know that when I and my wife attended church, I thought about that possibility. Someone who Hates us just because we go to church, and I thought about bringing the problem up. I quickly dismissed the probability of something like this happening because right across the street, is the Fairview Police Station. However, this is exactly where things like this do happen. In places where one is not allowed to carry a concealed firearm."
715,notsarc,"Wrong. Crocs, more accurately primitive crocs lived with dinosaurs. Modern crocs did not. Crocs came about 200 million years ago, Alligators much much later."
716,notsarc,"And yet they also claim other reasons ... fraud and $, which I was addressing."
717,notsarc,Incorrect- I think Olsen is very specific in citing those he feels have overstepped the mark in this instance. He is not ruling out the possibility of a link at all- he (rightly IMO) is targeting certain workers and publications.
718,notsarc,"I'm not trying to prove anything. I'm asking if you'd think differently in that case, and you're not answering."
719,notsarc,"That's is ridiculously poor logic. Simply becuase the church makes mistakes doesn't mean it's incorrect in all other charges. The US government is WAY more corrupt than the Catholic Church, and yet we obey every god-damned thing big brother makes us do."
720,notsarc,"As I said earlier, it is garbage. He can't back it up. As a scientist-in-training, you know that real science requires research and evidential support. supersport has neither. The ""support"" that he cites -- when read in their entirety -- do little or nothing to actually support him. On one forum (mentioned earlier on this forum), the author of the scientific paper that supersport cited actually joined the board to tell supersport to stop misrepresenting his research.The only ""agenda"" that the scientific community has is to find the truth. The fact that the scientific community trounces supersport's points nonstop is not what makes his points wrong; his points are wrong on their own merit, and they'd be wrong regardless of anybody's refutations of them."
721,notsarc,"The title of the thread gives a false impression by stating that a Christian Pastor believes that bigotry blocked Gay Marriage. Had the title said, pro-gay pastor believes bigotry blocked gay marriage, his position would have appeared as obvious as his views are. She is attempting to make it sound like the christian community is split, but bible believing pastors wouldn't be caught dead endorsing what this pastor believes in any aspect of his so called faith."
722,notsarc,"Excellent point. If the government only gave civil unions to everyone (heteros and gays alike) and the churches got to do the religious side of it, Civil Unons would be excellent. Unfortunately, those opposing gay marriage would never agree to such a thing."
723,notsarc,"Actually, try comparing murder rates with those of the UK - was my point, especially murder by gun. You've got your table of state shootings, and I've already argued against it."
724,notsarc,Homosexuals are attracted to people of the same sex whether they be adults are children.............The vast majority of the priests who were charged admitted to being gay............
725,notsarc,"Well, I have disagreed. But supposing that you are right (and you are not as I have shown), then you have successfully shown that abortion is frowned upon in Scripture. The verses you quote ALL describe the actions in those verses negatively. Congratulations, you proved what you were trying to disprove."
726,notsarc,"I know what you meant.My comment was to demonstrate the counter side of the issue.Interracial marriage laws were overturned at a time when this country disapproved of interracial marriage by a margin of three to one.By your approach, interracial marriage laws SHOULD NOT have been overturned in the 1960's.In fact, by your approach we still would have had illegal interracial marriage into the late 80's, early 90's.The 14th amendment makes no proviso about allowing unjust discrimination in cases of majority rule.By your approach, WHAT WOULD BE THE POINT?If the majority disapproves of the discrimination, they simply ""vote"" it out of existence. No need for the courts at all."
727,notsarc," I know a bit about this myself.  However the difference is that I was allowed to carry a gun under the reasonable man statute. An Armed person truly cannot be bullied! The old saying is. God created man and Samuel Colt made them equal! Old, disabled, female and all, are on an equal footing with these vicious predators!"
728,notsarc,"that is not true. a levitating guru that has been seen and proven to levitate doesnt make the process natural. an alien that has been seen and proven to teleport and abduct people in their retractor beam doesnt make the process less paranormal. the definition of supernatural/paranormal doesnt automatically mean they can never be observed, just that they defy physical law. the definition of God is a special case that includes never being observed/proven"
729,notsarc,"Again, you are the affirmative, you must support your claims. Please support the claim that we are using an atheist presupposition. I think we are using more an agnostic presupposition, which is a neutral one."
730,notsarc,"All born children, and every woman had the right to be rid of them. Killing them is not required as abortion is when they are in the womb (during the timeframe the majority of abortions occur, at least). They are not comparable."
731,notsarc,"And just how are the criminals and terroists to be kept from entering a school while armed?

732,notsarc,"How is that related to deterrence? 
 
 Once again, deterrence is preventing through the fear of consequences.
 
 What you are talking about is not related to the subject of deterrence."
733,notsarc,"Because the purpose of the US Bill of Rights is to grant or guarantee rights, not to prohibit or curtail personal freedoms."
734,notsarc,"This is a much poorer analogy than mine could possibly be. If drunk driving were legal and didn't affect anyone outside the driver's body it could be analogous. If drunk driving did not affect anyone outside the driver's body, I would agree that they probably should have the freedom to do so if they so choose (even if I personally disagreed). However, the reason drunk driving is illegal is that it endangers everyone on the road around the driver."
735,notsarc,"Very well said, but remember, Evolution doesnt mean atheism, but creationism means religion. I know Christians that believe in evolution, but i dont know atheists that believe in creationism."
736,notsarc,"Did you notice the word ""tend"" in there?
 
 Humans (in general) are actually very careful about protecting their young. Many organisms just produce a few thousand offspring and leave. Obviously, all of those offspring cannot survive."
737,notsarc,I believe that science explains the way God created the universe.
738,notsarc,"Gun registration schemes have been disabled for criminals because requiring them to register a gun they are forbidden to own would violate their 5th Amendment rights. I would assume that if ballistic fingerprinting ever became law, a form would be offered at time of sale where you would be required to waive any claim of 5th Amendment right injury from any governmental authority's use of the ballistic data. Don't sign the form - you don't get the gun."
739,notsarc,"Not at all, I'm simply forcing those making the argument to address the undeniable facts."
740,notsarc,"Well, I can't speak for anyone else, but I support any choice that the woman wants to make. No, I don't support forced abortions anywhere, I don't support what's going on in China and India because they're still taking a choice away from the women.What I don't get is that many prolifers think that prochoicers are ONLY for the choice of abortion. All the prochoicers I know support any choice the woman feels right about making. For example, I was called a hypocrite because I'm prochoice and pregnant. The person said ""You're forcing others to abort while you carry to term."" I have NEVER forced anyone to do anything, nor will I ever. I've also never aborted...and many prolifers automatically assume that if one is prochoice they've aborted."
741,notsarc,"Well, it showed how it was physically possible to generate amino acids from inorganic material. That's rather impressive. Again, irrelevant and unrelated to the Scientific theory of Evolution, regardless of you trying to create that association. Your continued attempt at doing so despite having been shown and told multiple times that the two are unrelated, well that only shows one thing, namely that you are dishonest."
742,notsarc,More people actuallysupport the FSM school of creationsim - would you agree that this could be a suitable compromise?
743,notsarc,No you can prevent the life of the unborn because they are not living but I don't think you should end the life of the born.
744,notsarc,"Please read carefully. He was talking about the US population, not the world. 
 
 The initial post was NOT detailing population control but bringing up the issue of resource allocation and parenting."
745,notsarc,"Bad Religion or misapplied Religion has been in every century, country and culture."
746,notsarc,"It's been reported in the Telegraph as well as several other news outlets. Want to slander them as well or do you want to try to disprove their story based on its content. I suggest the former, because the University has already confirmed the authenticity of the e-mails and documents. emoticonXRolleyes"
747,notsarc,"The VAST majority of abortions are performed within the first trimester. When they are performed in the second trimester it's a serious procedure for the mother to go through, and is something she obviously wouldn't go into lightly. Her reasons for choosing an abortion as late as that would have to far outweigh anything else, and she would need consent from two doctors to go ahead with it. Basically what I'm trying to say is something like the foetus being developed enough to feel pain would not change the mind of a woman who had just found out she was pregnant and she'd been raped, or was going through something you can't understand. For an abortion that late she'd have to deliver the foetus anyway, which is traumatising enough. "
748,notsarc,"Then why does the NRA use that quote at this link? 
 http://www.nraila.org/Issues/FactSheets/Read.aspx?ID=108"
749,notsarc,It has a chance. Any scientist has the opportunity to study ID. We are discussing the science classroom. We already teach it as a hypothesis in most schools. But it simply should not be taught as a valid alternative to evolution. That's what this debate is over.
750,notsarc,Actually it seems you are the one that is sick. You have this obsession with what others do with their sex life and want the government to try and prevent any kind of sex you dont approve of. It looks like you are trying hard to repress homosexual desires you have. Otherwise why do you care what others do when it doesnt affect you?I'm not for or against what other adults do with their consentual sex life. It's none of my business.
751,notsarc,"You're missing the point. The ghetto resistance was drastically outmanned and outgunned, and it still took the professional, well armed German military, nearly a month to beat them down into defeat."
752,notsarc,"Not all ""orgnansims"" are able to breed. Some are sterile (mules or ones with mutations), some die in the ""lottery"" (which is biased against certain traits), and some simply breed less (those who can't get as much food, for example)."
753,notsarc,"Actually, it's not. Mutations are random. Selection is differential reproductive success."
754,notsarc,"This statement is wrong. People from hundreds of years before Jesus was born prophesied that a baby would be born, in Bethlehem, of a virgin. There were over 50 more prophesies that were made about his life, and the sacrafice he made to pay for the sins of man, and the bigest one of all...He completely fufilled scripture when he rose from the dead. These men were inspired by Jesus, God, how can you argue that he is not the christ? The odds of one man filling all the prophesies is impossible. And these scriptures have been unchanged for the past 2000-2500 approx years! Thats proof for me that Jesus existed and that he is God. PM me if you like."
755,notsarc,"So much wrong with that sentence (and I'm ignoring the grammar emoticonXRolleyes)Rights have very little to do with what one perceives to be their (or society in general) moral obligations. Rights are concepts that focus on the actions of government and in the case of the US Constitution, usually represent exceptions of powers never granted to the government. In other words, they are redundant prohibitions (a fact which was a primary argument against adding a bill of rights to the constitution).And most egregious of all, liberty is not provided to you. Liberty is retained by citizens by not conferring to government every speck of sovereignty and self determination."
756,notsarc,"I know that also. But it still doesn&#8217;t say when a fetus becomes a human being. If God knew him two weeks before he was born, he would have known him in the womb. But for 8 1/2 months he wouldn&#8217;t have know him."
757,notsarc,"well i was downplaying your argument because really, pregnancy is not that demeaning to a womans body. ITS NATURAL! OBESITY ISNT!"
758,notsarc,Because God is free to show grace to some and judgement to others. It is what makes Him God and we can't begin to understand His perspective. He is not obliged to explain His eternal perspective to us at all.
759,notsarc,"Well, then I'd have to convert everest to kilometers. I live in the US. Metric is alien. haahh."
760,notsarc,That's obviously not what is said. The sun's energy is not claimed to be a mechanism that makes order of disorder. What it does do is override the tendancy within the 2LoTD where total usable energy in a system decreases.
761,notsarc,"It shot up as soon as Reagan launched his failed campaign of anti-sex education, cutting social services for the poor and destroying the US economy into a recession that favored the rich against the poor. Since social-economical reasons are often the reason why people have abortions it is no surprise we saw abortion sky-rocket under Reagans political atmosphere that was hostile to lower class families. If people were becoming more against abortion in the 90s then how can you explain Clintons popularity in winning two elections? The a friendlier economic atmosphere, contraception education and relief from Reaganism helped reduce the abortion rate. "
762,notsarc,"Actually, the black morph was always dominant. Perhaps you don't understand the meaning of the word dominant in biology. Perhaps that is why you talk nonsense. And why did you find it necessary to repeat what had already been said, and in fact what you had quoted?"
763,notsarc,"No one is saying alcohol is either...I would say both are not smart to use often...however, one beer is still better then smoking a bowl."
764,notsarc,GREED but what you fail to admit is that that standard of living comes at a price for someone.
765,notsarc,"If a scientist doesn't believe his test results are accurate, and expects me to place my life savings on his project would that not be pretty stupid."
766,notsarc,"Origins of science, whether truly started by those of faith or not, is irrelevant. Whatever science was, it has become a body of knowledge, through application of reason."
767,notsarc,"Thank God. I too hope it doesn't keep going back and forth. While I live across the river in Parkville, Missouri, I used to live in Overland Park Kansas and went to school there. I think they are generally pretty good public schools, it's just the state school board that keeps effing everything up when they get some christonazis on board."
768,notsarc,In which you contradict your first clause with the second. You say reason isn't about finding truth; but separating if from what is false; which is to find what is truth!
769,notsarc,Both. It's where a human life begins but not a life yet.
770,notsarc,"Great. Then define information. If it is unseen, how do you know that it didn't increase. Isn't it necessary that there should be a way to quantify informatiion before you can make claims as to whether it has or has not increased? Again, evolution doesn't account for the origin of life, only the origin of the changes in the heritable characteristics that are observed in populations of living organisms."
771,notsarc,"Because if evolution cannot explain all changes it is false, Unless you propose some creatures evolved and some were specially created. Is that what you mean?Genesis says that all creatures were specially created. It fits with the observational evidence but there is no smoking gun that proves it.Statis is the norm not the exception.One is right the other wrong. It cannot be both ways.Do you have an answer to how a lizard can morph into a bird considering the amazing difference in the lungs?"
772,notsarc,"If you still believe this way, then you must believe then it is OK to kill a child that has been born if it might not be loved, or might suffer, etc. That is the logical conclusion to your argument. If an unborn child and a born child are the same to you, then you cannot make a distinction as to which one should be killed and which one shouldn't. That is the spiralling hole into which abortion leads. There is a basic loss of respect for human life. Your defense actually scares me more than someone who deceives themself into believing the unborn child is not alive."
773,notsarc,"I think there are two separate questions here.(1) When does personhood begin?(2) Who gets to make such arbitrary, moral decisions on behalf of a pregnant woman?Both are legitimate issues of contention. You can't just dismiss the one you don't want to argue as unimportant. There are lots of excellent arguments going every which way, and many of them are objectively unresolvable, such as the one pertaining to the onset of personhood. They are truly matters of opinion.So, since there is obviously little agreement between people about when an egg and sperm become a person with full human rights, the practical question really is whose opinion matters most? The woman's, or the faceless bureaucrat's? emoticonXGood"
774,notsarc,"No, I wasn't looking for religious morality, I was looking for general morality, so your argument was the kind I wanted to debate. Anyway, what is with people thinking that an activity that creates children is neccesarily a good thing? There are already a lot of people in the world, and too many more will end up using up all the food, and then there will no people, because we will all die an agonizing death of starvation. Heterosexuality is good, without any reproduction we would die out as well, but homosexuality is also very good and important because without enough non reproductive couples, the population would increase even more."
775,notsarc,"It is so the womans decision. If the baby is in the womb they haven't experience life, so how can they miss it. And if they are a so called ""soul"" then they will come out somewhere else."
776,notsarc,"I see now, sorry. Yes you are right: chemical reactions are not random. Simple reactions will be easy to determine precisely. More complex reactions will be more chaotic, but they still will not be random."
777,notsarc,Because he was found guilty of murdering a minor rather than an adult. Any crime committed by an adult against a child is more heinous in nature.
778,notsarc,"So you made the point on the interpretation of a legal document. The point is it is okay to illegalise abortion regardless of the reasons for doing so. Thinking outside of our current example can you not see the glaring problem with such an approach? I hope you can because the consequences of accepting such a philosophy are dire indeed.However, returning to our original point, that being the former part of the proposed Bill's title I'd like some supporting evidence. I have pointed out the issue's with Steeeeve's citation, so hope you have something else to offer."
779,notsarc,actually some did talk about the complexity of life as well as irreducible complexity even though it may not be mentioned in the title
780,notsarc,"Just by being something man made, this cannot be a right. Any right that all humans deserve comes directly from God. For example, life, liberty, and property. I understand that many people do not have health insurance. It sucks, and everyone knows it. It is not a right, it is a good. Goods can be purchased in a competitive market priced based on the law of supply and demand, well in our capitalist society. This is an expensive good, and not everyone is fortunate enough to have it. That is just the way it goes, there are ways to fix it, there are ways to make it cost less, but not everyone is going to get it no matter how hard we try. Unless, God makes it a right, it is not one."
781,notsarc,"But the responsibility does not end with the woman who experiences the pregnancy. If it did, then men would not be required by law to pay child support."
782,notsarc,"You are also protected by the 4, 5, and 14th Amendments. Your guns can not be seized. You can not be under suspicion for your guns to be seized without due process. All your legally obtained property is yours do to with in any way you want as long as it is legal.Lets not forget privacy. No one has the right to stick your nose into your business to even find out what your doing with your guns."
783,notsarc,"Too much spin there buddy. The potentiality arguement is used by those who believe women have a right to have control over their fertility. As an aside it is also a fundemental tenent in Judaism's view of the unborn- the foetus is a potential life, but has not yet attained that state of being, which occurs at birth."
784,notsarc,"NO, these were all ammedments. all passed. All written recently. There are laws on the book from the 1800's but that isn't what just passed."
785,notsarc,"Exactly. Trying to prove that God, if he exists, didn't make us as good as an all powerful being should have made us doesn't prove anything in the God debate. I could always debate that since God is all powerful and all knowing he could have always thought of something better to do. If he made those changes, then of course there would still be something better he could have thought of. This would be an endless loop of creating something better and better until finally he would have to stop and say that is good enough. But even then this debate that he didn't make us as good as he could have would be valid in my view."
786,notsarc,"That is a nice little pistol with lots of smack for only 11 onces. Also, I like DA automatics."
787,notsarc,"#2 was questioning the personal, non-scientific beliefs of the evolution believer"
788,notsarc,"Well survival of the fittest was not Darwins term- although he may of used it it the later editions of the Origin. The phase was actually coined by Herbert Spencer in 1851.Weiner could be forgiven for his statement- if he had read the first edition of the Origin (regarded as being the best version as it contains no responses to critiscsms that were levelled at the preceeding editions) he would not have come across it under Darwins name.It is moot really, as natural selection is the term that is used in this context today."
789,notsarc,"I think some people will and have argued that. I'll work on finding a quote, but I believe it was somebody here who argued that, because of the recent SCotUS ruling, home invasion in DC would decrease because criminals would be more worried about encountering a homeowner with a gun. You do have a point about preventing a worse crime from occuring,though."
790,notsarc,"Doctors ARE schooled in nutrition, however inadequately, this doesn't mean they're going to recommend crackpot ""raw food"" dietary schemes to prevent destructive ""lamarckian evolution"" on the basis of a single flawed experiment on cats."
791,notsarc,Really? I suspect that you have been duped by creationist ministers. There is no hype about Miller/Urey. It was an interesting experiment that demonstrated possibilities.
792,notsarc,"You are welcome to your faith, and you can use it to believe whatever you like, but this continuing misconception of yours that (on the subject of evolution) we're exchanging beliefs and opinions of equal merit can only be counterproductive. Evidence inevitably weighs in, and apart from a single chapter in a single book all of it is landing on my side. Either the whole world is lying to me, or that one chapter is allegorical, misinterpreted or just plain wrong. It does not require faith, bias or belief to be convinced when the evidence is overwhelming. You proudly proclaim you have the faith, the bias, necessary - that's fine; as I said you're welcome to it. But don't make the mistake of assuming everyone forms their opinions the same way."
793,notsarc,"Yes, but this is why I brought up the bible, because that would be an alternate reason that would not be caused by homosexual brains that could occur in cultures supportive of homosexuality. I believe that you are right about Japanese culture, if you delved into it you would find there is not a genetic but cultural cause for their high suicide rates, but I believe that you would find the same thing with homosexuality."
794,notsarc,"Any geologists want to help me out here?What they mean by this is that there are sediments in one place and sediments in another place. They can date them radiometrically to determine that they are both from the Edicarian period (even though they may be seperated by millions of years). They then verify that they are Edicarian by looking at the layering to determine if the two pieces were at one point connected, but are now seperated due to tectonics.I'm sure I'm not entirely correct about these methods.I think I'd better study up on some of these qeustions HERE.Maybe you should too."
795,notsarc,"If DOMA isn't declared unconstitutional, then those arguing against Prop 8 are micturating into the wind."
796,notsarc,"You can do whatever you want to do with your money. The fact that you don't know any better than to do that with your money is telling, though. If you think that the C(R)SC actually does ID-based scientific research, you're exactly the dupe they're looking for.I'm serious. Do the research for yourself. I won't even give you links, because you'll XXXX them off as propaganda. Find any scientific journal article written by a DI member that's actually based on actual scientific experimentation or investigation and supports ID. I dare you."
797,notsarc,"While this is true, the number of abortions at or after 21 weeks is not insignificant. According to the Guttemacher Institute, 1.2% of abortions occur at or after 21 weeks. That translates into about 15,480 abortions. This thread, of course, is talking specifically about those 15,480 abortions."
798,notsarc,But that is your goal whether you want to admit it or not. And that is your sole way of defending creationism as you have admitted you cannot argue creationism based on its own merits. Creationism is wrong independent of Evolution. Even if you somehow manage to disprove evolution (along with every science) you still have to even take a single step towards proving Creationism.
799,notsarc,"Well either way he didn't answer the question. I saw the video. I saw and heard his responce. He can't squirm his way out of the fact that he didn't know the answer. 
 The internet site also quotes:"
800,notsarc,"You are exactly right and I believe that is Gods intent. When it comes right down to it, each person must make his peace with God. It is our responsibility and our right as individuals. We have the freedom to choose. It is our God-given right to decide what we will do with God and Christ. "
801,notsarc,I think the energy( essence of the human life) always was
802,notsarc,"Again, it's not the point. There are many who don't deny evolution, they believe it was guided. Showing examples of guidence - through artificial selection supports this theory"
803,notsarc,"And as such, the term as you use it is utterly meaningless as it could be applied to any cell or sell remnant of human origin."
804,notsarc,"And that is why there is no plutonium found in the natural (fossil) fission reactors discovered in Oklo, Gabon in Africa.A fission reaction in the presence of U-238 always produces plutonium. In fact, about 1/3 of the energy output from a typical reactor in the U.S. comes from the fission of plutonium-239 that is created by the fission of U-235. When there is not enough fissionable material left in the fuel to sustain a reaction, there always remains several isotopes of plutonium that were not present in the original enriched uranium fuel."
805,notsarc,"For a 13 year old girl that could greatly damage her body to have a pregnancy so young. She is just starting to grow and mature, and its not healthy, natural, or right to have a pregnancy at that age. She could cause alot of damage being that young."
806,notsarc,"No, I mean evolution, in which statistically random variation is but one factor. It's a terrible mistake to equate evolution with pure chance."
807,notsarc,"Yes, it does have value only if the woman wants it, in the early stages, when it doesn't have sentience, only potential and DNA. Because then it has value only because of a woman's wants and choices and her dreams for the future. Nothing else gives it value."
808,notsarc,And how did the Wise Creator come into existence? All that wisdom and creativity cannot come to existence accidentally or spontaneously...
809,notsarc,"It is more along the lines of tree dwelling to prairie. Take a look at how the
 current tree dwelling primate loco move, then look the mammals that live
 on the plains tend to stand up to peer over the grass to see if enemies are coming."
810,notsarc,"Actually, there's a birth every 8 seconds, and a death every 11 seconds, which means the population of the earth grows less than 1% each year...so, even with those aborted babies, the world would NOT be overpopulated."
811,notsarc,"Yes, but gays would also want laws changed to accomodate THEIR form of marriage as well. The fact that one requires less change than the other shouldn't matter, should it? Should having to do more reworking of laws and more paperwork hinder the pursuit of equality? It seems to me your argument boils down to ""polygamy requires more work to make the laws accomodate it."" Yeah--such is the price for marriage equality.Let's face it--if society really wanted to make marriage an open-ended institution of equality rather than for opposite-sex couples which comprise most relationships, they could pull it off--polygamy, gays, letting 17 year olds marry, etc. All those civil servants are there and can do it as directed as legislation is changed. Means could be set up to determine inheritance, for example. Laws can be worded to do it."
812,notsarc,"So youre saying we would not have clindamycin without the ToE? The ToE is supposed to be defined as changes in alleles, not changes in anything someone wishes to assign it to. It seems that in addition to the term evolution being broadened to mean just about any change, it is also substituted for the word science at will. Notice how it was done in post #2 above. The word evolution was dropped, and the word science replaced it. What are the possibilities that evolution is brought in as a narrative gloss after a discovery, rather than being a cornerstone of all of biology, or all of science? CSC - Why Do We Invoke Darwin?"
813,notsarc,"It can go both ways. We all doubt. It is what you do with it that matters.[QUOTE=gnojek]If a child grew up never hearing the words religion, gods, spirits, etc. would this child still have faith of some sort?Is faith some innate human tendency?It could be seeing as how there is the ""god spot"" in the brain, but maybe the god spot wouldn't develop as fully in the child that was never exposed to religion or thoughts of the supernatural.QUOTE]Look around. Faith did not spontaneously generate out of thin air. It is obviously part of our psyche. Every civilization throughout history has felt the need for some type of faith. Even on different sides of the planet.It's as natural as the sun rising."
814,notsarc,"First, why don't you do the calculations yourself and tell me the answer you get. The current rate of change of the earth's rotation is about 2 milliseconds per day per century. US Naval Observatory Please note that this rate is high at the present time because of the current arrangement of the continents.Will get to the rest later"
815,notsarc,"They do it on purpose, alright. But not because it'll be shot down -- in at least one state, the Supreme Court decided that similar legislation did not address more than one issue.The reason they put them together is that, in most states, a ban on civil unions would FAIL."
816,notsarc,"I believe that a system of rights is superior to a system of democracy. The US by the way, was never intended to be a democracy, but a republic - the difference being that in a republic an individual has his rights respected, while in a democracy the will of majority is the law.The ""right to vote"" or ""right to democracy"" is perhaps the greatest offender in the drama of conflicting rights such made up rights create, because where the will of the majority is law, no other rights can possibly exist."
817,notsarc,"We could ask you the same thing. Why do you constantly try and oversimplify things by claiming that gun control will work, while at the same time not discussing matters relating to income, surroundings, upbringing, recidivism rates, prison sentences and other such matters? "
818,notsarc,So you subscribe to the inaccurate idea that Irish people are part of a different group to the English people? Genetics indicate that the UK is made up of a fairly homogenous group of people stretching back for thousands of years....
819,notsarc,"I see that you missed to point. I was correcting you lack of knowledge about carbon 14 dating. You think that you can date fossils of this age with carbon. You also seem to think that you can date rocks with carbon 14. You can't. Time after time you reveal your ignorance by your inability to respond appropriately. KNM-WT 15000 was dated from stratigraphic studies of the area and dating of specific, appropriate rock samples from above and below the fossils."
820,notsarc,"No, say you've got 200 of some species. By some event, 100 member are seperated. Now we have two groups of 100. Each group goes through different selections and they accumulate small changes. Eventually, they will be different enough so that they are no longer able to interbreed. That doesn't mean one group automatically has to die so we remain at the same number of species.Of course, one group might get some significant advantage which allows it to come back and ownzor the original area so the other group gets wiped out."
821,notsarc,"Yes. (In a way.)
 We are ""in"" the same thing that existed way back then. It has just expanded since then, so it's much bigger now.
 
 
 ."
822,notsarc,"And once again, is this a strong enough rebuttal to assert proof? no, Behe assumes that a biochemical system that exists today cannot have a precursor, or less complex state of existence. Clive did a good job of demolishing this notion with the mouse trap example he lin the debate thread."
823,notsarc,But your own link says that the rise in crime was partially explained by the new system the UK police were using for recording crime and that the British Crime Survey showed a decrease in crime since 1997.
824,notsarc,"Intelligent design is a recent concept (not associated with any one religion) and it hasn't had over 100 years to be studied. Why not start now? It can't happen if we block it from future generations. Why not give it a chance, study it, search for evidence, and offer it up for peer review? What are you afraid of? That it can mathematically rule out previous evolutionary theories?"
825,notsarc,"depends on what you consider proof. A beliief that they are is rubbish as it cannot be proven. A argument based upon behavior, history and countless examples, well it seems you don't consider that you be of any use.That sentence doesn't even make sense! I won't go into arguing that your claim is right because I don't believe it."
826,notsarc,So you are saying that the democrats have no choice but to inaugarate Brown and let him stop the bill? You suggest that whatever option they pick will be political suicide.
827,notsarc,"I googled your signature, and I found this just before your quote mine: ""Some of the most mythic of scientific notions lie in the realm of evolutionary biology. Evolution  the proposition that all organisms are related  is as highly verified a thesis as can be found in science. Subjected to close scrutiny from all angles for over a century now, evolution emerges as the only naturalistic explanation we have of the twin patterns of similarity and diversity that pervade all life. The basic notion that life has evolved is as certain as the existence of gravity or the idea that the earth is spheroidal. We call such highly verified notions facts when they consistently escape all attempts to prove them false. Evolution is no myth.""Finally, please present evidence."
828,notsarc,So why are you so afraid of it? If it is bad you will have a choice to go to a private insurance company.
829,notsarc,This is not true or requires at least more justification.
830,notsarc,"I think it would be an exception as well.But if you see an indicator that might point to an ""exception"", I think the question should be asked.Consider the flip side of things. The question doesn't get asked.If Skip had been the type of man to let a gay couple's house burn to spite gays, don't you think that the gay couple would have had grounds to sue the city in such a situation?Part of this is just the city covering its own XXX. If they ask the question, and the guy lies, they have helped to cover their own XXX by asking the question."

However http://www.ncseweb.org/icons/ appears to have a detailed critique of the book and may be of interest to you too. As I say I haven't read the original so cannot judge the quality of the link I'm supplying, so apologies in advance if it grossly misrepresents Mr Well's case."
832,notsarc,But it should be the job of science to establish a clear line between just where established fact stops and philosophy starts. There's no indication that they're getting it done.
833,notsarc,"How else should it be done? It is a constiturionally protected right. To eliminate that right, the constitutional protection must be removed first, is the removal itself, becomes unconstitutional."

835,notsarc,"But my point is that the Supreme Court has disagreed. Hence the illegitimate legal doctrine of substantive due process, which maintains that the due process clause can be violated even in cases where due process has been given."
836,notsarc,"What's your claim? That the seasonal molt of arctic foxes is evolution or that it is not? As usual, your responses show muddled thinking."
837,notsarc,"I think VTs reason for posting that video was to show that this 12 year old girl has more wisdom regarding abortion, and sensitivity to human life than most adults possess today. And she rightfully pointed out the true and very real downsides of what abortions represent for the women who get them. She showed that the human misery of killing more than a million unborn babies a year goes much deeper than just the babies that die from abortions. they affect the mother emotionally as well as her future ""wanted"" children in many cases."
838,notsarc,"Please stop making statements that have nothing whatsoever to do with the debate at hand. We're not talking about Christian fundamentalism and ""reality""."
839,notsarc,"It used to mean that, now it is just a screen name. I was a big fan of AMD back when I was invested in them. They are still a decent company but they can't seem to keep up with Intel.I like your screen name as well. Im guessing you got the idea from Braveheart which is my favorite movie of all time!"
840,notsarc,"Well, here is my take on it. I really believe that only the truly evil end up in Hell. Those like Hitler. I think that anyone else goes to heaven - Wiccans, Atheists, Buddhists, etc. - anyone who follows Christ's message of love, tolerance, and acceptance, whether knowingly or not. Those who preach hate, and those who act on that hate, like Hitler, the KKK, and any other person/persons filled with hate (sad to say, this seems to apply to our own friend Archie here) are the ones who will end up in hell."
841,notsarc,"I agree, that is one very important question the article does not address. I've not been able to Google any answer either; perhaps it is something that is undisclosed."
842,notsarc,Science is the current sum of human knowledge about how the world works.
843,notsarc,Yet another application of a different meaning of the word in an effort to group everything in science that you don't understand and won't accept under one word.
844,notsarc,"Obviously not. If the right to life trumps all other rights, then it follows that the mother's right to life and the child's right to life cancel each other out. 
 
 Mind you, if it's her choice then the pro-life movement endorses such heroism, right?"
845,notsarc,In all fairness the Pharmacist does serve an important vetting role in the supply of medication to patients- they check what has been prescribed by the doctor against they know about and correct errors that are made (which do happen... I was once given a 7 week course of anti-malarials which turned out to be suitable for taking no more than 28 days at a time).That aside I'd agree with sinjin.
846,notsarc,He didn't! I hope you reported that to the admin
847,notsarc,"I think you fail to take into account that for most opposers of abortion, they genuinely feel they are trying to save lives by their opposition. In many cases it's not a matter of trying control sexual prermissiveness in society but preventing lives from being killed. Disagree or not, you can't separate the anti-abortion message from the fact that it holds to the view that abortion is a form of murder."
848,notsarc,"Because I am one who likes see things from different angles. What better way to fight your enemies then to understand their viewpoint. Before I am attacked on the the last statement, just because I understand a viewpoint does not meant that I accept it as true or that I don't reject it."
849,notsarc,"The national guard is related to a standing army under the control of the government, a militia is not genius."
850,notsarc,The process of evolution has no scientifically known teleology and follows no known predestined plan. It does not teach that there cannot be any such things as teleology or forethought. This is where your mistake lies.
851,notsarc,"Creationists need to latch on to the intellectual integrity of science. They know that if they can represent their claims as ""scientific"", many people who otherwise would ignore them will pay attention to their incredible claims.To put it crudely, the creationists seek a ride on the science bandwagon."
852,notsarc,"Yes Peeling; you say this with such assurance, yet what you can't explain with any assurance is why only one offshoot of the Primate genus evolved into what human beings are today. Why only us, when we all allegedly started in the same environment with the same ecosystems putting the same pressures on us. What I'm saying is that in every place where our alleged primate ancestors fossils have been found, so haven't the fossils of animals described as lower primates been found. So your explanation that one species evolved while another stagnated or died out rings hollow with me. Especially since you can actually prove absolutely none of this. Can't you see that Peeling? None of this is provable."
853,notsarc,"Since it wasn't thought up by Hubble, the rest of your post doesn't follow."
854,notsarc,"Thats an odd analogy. Can a child survive without its mother? I'd say a baby is no less dependent on its mother the first few years than it is when in it grew in the womb.
 
 Is the child still a parasite then?"
855,notsarc,"So God already knows if a particular person will become an addict? That doesn't leave much free choice for that person, does it? If I go to a restaurant and God already knows I'm going to choose the poached salmon for my entree, then I don't have much choice in the matter, do I? Omniscience and free will are mutually exclusive. If God is omniscient, then we are indeed ultimately robots. Deluded with the perception of free will, but robots none the less.Unless of course, God is so omnipotent that he can know everything and still allow free choice. But then reason, logic, and thought become delusional. Sounds like a loose / loose situation to me."
856,notsarc,Recent comparisons between the complete chimp genome and the human genome have found that possibly fewer than 3 million nucleotide differences exist in functional DNA.
857,notsarc,"But there is evidence that we do evolve. I'll give you an example. In areas of west Africa where malaria is endemic there is an allele of hemoglobin that confers resistance when heterozygous. In other environments that allele is not beneficial and is, in fact, deleterious. It is fatal when homozygous. Now according to evolutionary theory such an allele should decline where it offers no benefit. Studies show that this allele is less frequent by about 2 percentage points in Americans of west African ancestry."
858,notsarc,"Apologies, that wasn't my intention. My meaning was this; while it was your conclusion, your use of it as an unsupported 'fact' forced us to treat it as an assumption. We had no way by which we could make it a conclusion - that's the purpose of this thread!"
859,notsarc,"You SERIOUSLY need to take a basic biology course so you can stop sticking your foot in your mouth emoticonXRolleyes An egg is NOT larva, and larva is NOT a caterpillar, and a caterpillar is NOT a butterfly - much the same as a zygote is NOT a embryo, and a embryo is NOT a fetus, and a fetus is NOT a baby, and a baby is NOT an adult. I challenge you to prove that a larva is exactly the same as a butterfly. If you can't even do something as simple as that, then you'll never understand the process/transformation of what a human has to go through, and THAT in and of itself should give you a clue as to how much in denial you are in, and how much you have to twist the truth around just to justify your version of events. Deal with it!"
860,notsarc,"Know of them, no, since I haven't studied any of it, however, typing in ""cave drawing"" at wikipedia brought this up, I suggest you take a look. Cave painting"
861,notsarc,Hmmm... He may get things right only when he thinks getting it right contradicts evolution...
862,notsarc,"Well the government track record in health care isn't too good. Medicare is broke and busted by their own accounts. So if they can't run that correctly by what stretch of the imagination do you come up with them being able to manage the whole healthcare industry? Medicaid is broke. The VA healthcare system is a shambles. You would think they would get them up and running smoothly before trying to sell us the snake oil of their healthcare. Then there is the big problem of rationing. No matter what lies are told, health care is rationed in socialized medicine."
863,notsarc,"There are no objective reasons to condemn gays. Marriage is not a matter of state and so it is meaningless to argue whether a state should recognize it.My advocating of perfect liberty allows no contradictions or exceptions, believe me I have lost alot of support from conservatives for this, perhaps even gays if one really applied it to all extremes."
864,notsarc,"you based this (and other claims) on a summary of the biomorphs program at website that either a) didn't also provide dawkins limitations on the program or b) had the limitations and you didn't bother to relay this information to the forum. You then make incredulous statements about how unrealistic the biomorphs are. any quotations of web pages are irrelevant because they do not address the basic issue that you are suggesting dawkins puts the biomorphs forth as a model of evolution and natural selection. This is not true as i have quoted part of his book that puts limitations on the biomorphs program, and draws attention to what ""morals"" should be drawn out of the biomorphs."
865,notsarc,"Dealt with. Wolves and dogs share a genus, not a species. Along with coyotes and jackels. See above for lots of transitionals, also."
866,notsarc,"Well then, my skeptic fellow Australians, what is the answer to the question? Do any of you guys here know? I sure as hell don't. Creationists did not misquote Dawkins because the words came from his mouth. And Dawkins is a professional at biology, but he could not answer such a question.In the little amount of fossils that we do see, they are not evolutionary. There is no clear cut fossils showing the evolution of man, is there. By ""true human"" I mean they were just like us, just varients of human kind that we have today - looked human, walked like us, most likely were quite intelligent. I have got to go to school, continue this later."
867,notsarc,"And you've been failing miserably, partly because your definition of ""atheism"" is asinine. Even most Christians would disagree with you."
868,notsarc,"Yes, it is very hard, even for theologians, to explain."
869,notsarc,I've seen people (on TV:)) who would actually know about such things say that the fact that these things passed in these states pretty much spels doom for any possible constitutional ammendment. Don't ask me how they figure this. It's just what they were saying.
870,notsarc,"Well, one can't be truly logical and not be an atheist (or at least agnostic.) As any religion simply flys in the face of logic. Faith and logic are poles apart.
 
 Keep truckin' Jim! Happy weekend to you bro."
871,notsarc,"In the examples you gave, the doctor is clearly trying his* very best to save the most lives he can. What if the Siamese twins were in no mortal danger while together? And what if one Siamese twin has legs but the other doesn't? Isn't the other twin dependent on the one with legs? Could a doctor ethically remove the legless twin if the legged twin wanted to and if the legless twin was retarded and the procedure would leave the legless twin dead?*(or her best.. I'm sorry but my doctor is male, so I will no longer use ""his/her"" or ""he/she""... it just gets tiring after a while...)"
872,notsarc,"Now you're playing word games to confuse people. Page 11 of the Heller ruling stated that the definition of ""arms"" include all modern forms of bearable arms that're in common use. They didn't rule on machineguns because they weren't part of the case."
873,notsarc,"Would that work like the ban on illegal drugs in American? Does that ban keep illegal drugs out of American? The ban on illegal drugs does one thing, it does keep illegal drugs from law-abiding citizens. Law-abiding citizens are the only ones that respect the law when it comes to bans."
874,notsarc,"Your statement is a logical fallacy. It is not proof but simply illogical. The fallacy is called the fallacy of inconsistency. You argue from two contradictory premises. 1) God is all Powerful, 2) God can not do something.You state one as the conclusion of the other but that is just a funny way of stating two premises. The statement is illogical. Look up your favorite text on logical fallacies and you will see that I am right."
875,notsarc,"Invalid argument to assert that mutations can map a road outside of their assigned task in illogical, where would the information to do so come from? Biology works because every individual cell doing what it was created to do along with what the one next to it was, though created to perform another set of instructions creates the molecular change that the combination of the cells together would produce. But there is no additional information there... not int he way you assert."
876,notsarc,"Not in this instance, no. It isnt trying to parallel pregnancy per se(though it is most relevant for us if we take it as only 9 months), but trying to parallel the moral scenario of having a person attached to you against your will and without your consent. If the pro-life mantra is to be believed, it is never correct to disconnect someone if they will die if you do. So, the argument is applicable for 9 days, 9 months, 9 years or forever."
877,notsarc,I agree. What is the point? Felons with firearms do not bother with CCW licenses.
878,notsarc,I believe I said I would change my view. I will change my view on the issue of whether homosexuality is genetic.
879,notsarc,"Actually, this (if what that article is true, which I am not quite sure) is a healthy part of science. Old theories are disgarded and new ones come in as more evidence is brought to bare. Every theory made by fallible man is prone to being disproven and destroyed. Man's theories change everyday, while God's word has remained the same."
880,notsarc,"Since evolution is a non-theistic theory (it does not consider if there is a god or not), you will have to look at some like http://www.theistic-evolution.com/I would also look up Kenneth MIller on the web... a highly Christian biologist who defends evolution."
881,notsarc,When the needs of the two are in conflict this is unavoidable.
882,notsarc,Well he has further political aspirations..........The 9th circuit in Sodom (SF) is always making law instead of interpreting it........That is why they are over ruled so often.......
883,notsarc,"Although i personally oppose abortion,i agree that two wrongs dont make it right."
884,notsarc,I think you're mixing up socialist and fascist. Patriotism is anathema to socialism.
885,notsarc,"Well, it is being challenged in the courts, so the only way to overturn it would be to deem it no longer constitutional.
 
 
 Oh, and thank you!"
886,notsarc,This seems to conflict with some of your earlier posts wherein you support terrorists.
887,notsarc,"No nation is perfect, Rev. Not even the USA! A singular instance that you quote is not an argument as anyone can just as easily find criticism with the USA over people freed early from jail.You will find black people over-represented in the jails of the UK, the USA and Australia. There is injustice everywhere."
888,notsarc,"Actually you are incorrect. The most commonly used rifles on the competition circuit are so-called ""assault weapons"".The ""assault weapon"" moniker is a term just recently fashioned to describe a military looking weapon.There are several target competitions designed solely for these types of rifles."
889,notsarc,"Yes, I believe there will be a lot more to come (as you said, just look at the ""hobbits"" that were recently discovered). I love this sort of look into the migrations of everyone over the last 160,000 years or so."

Actually, the uranian tapeworm hypothesis,. as far fetched as it may be, is more testable than a supernatural designer.I think maybe the kids SHOULD be taught intellegent design as an example of pseudo-science. Hopefully they will see why it is not science and why evolutionary theory is."

 One of my favorite Sidney Harris cartoons was two scientists coming out of a conference presentation, and one, absolutely thrilled, says to the other, ""What a wonderful talk - everything we know is wrong!"""

894,notsarc,"Well, assuming that when the Bible says ""you"" in passages that are telling ""you"" to do something with your soul, I would hope that it also applies to women. But it never comes out and says ""women and men have souls."" This doesn't mean they don't have them.Same thing with animals. The book isn't written for non-humans, so when it says ""you"" we can assume it doesn't refer to non-humans. But the book never says ""animals don't have souls.""So we can't assume that they don't (according to the bible)."
895,notsarc,"So why should you care about their non-scientific beliefs in a debate on science? Most people who believe in evolution do so because of science, so their non-scientific beliefs are irrelevant."
896,notsarc,"Because, when each is in its natural habitat, they are reproductively isolated."
897,notsarc,"I know of at least 3 personally, including my brother. He fought for custody for years and it nearly bankrupted him.

902,notsarc,Your XXX-umption that is a poor attempt to certify a false delimma has long been answered. How many people have been killed in Africa with short handled hoes and machetes? Nary a gun amoungst them.
903,notsarc,"To those who are sympathetic to gun control. Can we get anyone to listen and change society, ooooor will you just use this problem, and these under trained and under socialized kids to persecute the 2nd Amendment! I am 61 years old, and I can remember when schools filled the gap and taught morals. Now they are not allowed for fear that they might offend someones religious unbelief and be sued. We reap what we sow. If we sow nothing, we reap nothing."
904,notsarc,"So you know how foolish you are and hope that name calling will distract from that being recognized by everyone. Erectus skulls were smaller because the brain was smaller. You brought up KNM-WT 15000 (Turkana Boy) and you weren't even aware that as an adult he would have been about 6'1"" tall? Why is his skull smaller than modern humans?"
905,notsarc,"But let me guess ... if they step down RIGHT after they find they will have to issue to gay couples, you'd be in favor of them being able to be sued for it, simply because the ""discrimination"" in such an event was toward gays? Right? At least if you are consistent with your stance elsewhere in regards to 'timing' ... emoticonXRolleyesAnyway, aside from that inconsistency with your position elsewhere, I agree that county officials should need to comply. After all, there are probably OTHER examples whereby county officials have to do things that they are religiously against, such as issue divorce papers. Or marry some drunk couple that they know aren't really being serious even though they're tying the knot ... If all county officials could just refuse to do their job because of their objections--for WHATEVER reasons--it would be a collosal mess."
906,notsarc,"So atheism doesn't ""need"" facts? If it claims to have complete knowledge of evolution, doesn't it need all the facts? If the answer is no, then how can it argue against religion? Miller didn't explain it."
907,notsarc,********. Utter fraking ****. Scientists have already accumulated mounds of evidence which suggest the common ancestor. You choose to ignore it as do most scientifically ignorant christians.
908,notsarc,I don't think that any marriage rights are required at all by the Consitution.
909,notsarc,"Yes. It's not logical to simply cite, ""the Bible tells me so, the Bible was written by God,"" and consider that an argument. The Bible has been wrong. It's also not logical to cite authority to God. It necessarily begs further questions about your God's unproven existence to those who don't believe in that God, or in any God. If we don't simply believe in your God, on the basis of your presupposition, he can have no authority over the rest of us. One must come up with another argument.Should each religion have it's own definition or completely different idea of logic, which favours that religion and its God? "
910,notsarc,"Because there's absolutely no due process in this proposal. Your name is on the list, your rights are revoked. That's not due process. There's no court of law, no trial, no verdict, no attorneys, no chance for the accused to defend themselves, etc. We still haven't forgotten the Homeland Security memo that said veterans and those opposed to abortion could be potential terrorists."
911,notsarc,By your own admission you havent 'hung out' with stoners for a while and you're making generalisations about them to people who do spend a lot of time with stoners?
912,notsarc,"Actually, they didn't. The whole tragedy was caused by gun control. If even one student was packing when that occured, 33 lives could have been saved. But no, more victims of botched laws and corrupt politicians."
913,notsarc,"Not quite.

It is your administration costs what are getting you the most. We only spend around 11% on administration while the USA spends around 25% of their health care dollars. We have a cap on how much a doctor can be sued for as well. Yes, our system isn't perfect, but it still works.Nearly 50 million Americans don't have health care at all, that is around 18% of your total population. This is quite shameful. As I've stated, the USA is the only Nation in the Industrialize world to not have universal health care."

I thought we were talking about changes in allele frequencies and differential reproductive success, and you barf out some nonsense about information and molecules to man. What does that mean? How is that applicable to evolutionary theory? Are you a parrot or can you actually define information. Are you talking about Shannon information? Yaukey information? What do you mean when you say ""information."""
918,notsarc,Who said it did? I was only pointing out the absurdity of gun control laws and how they lead to federal overlords deeming that your not capable of playing with matches. (I would not be suprised if this were next.)
919,notsarc,"No-one experiences the existence of an outside world. Explanations such as the Matrix can explain sense impressions as well as some concept of 'external reality'. We have no more evidence for one than the other.The fact no-one takes them seriously is a psychological point about human beings, nothing to do with reality per se."
920,notsarc,Most of the time one should be able to tell the sex of the baby by about 20 weeks and very often even at sixteen. Second trimester starts at 12 weeks. You cant get an abortion after determining the sex because its illegal.Where are you getting your data?
921,notsarc,"I don't think this approach is all that new, but I have to admit that I haven't been around as many of the old-school creationists."
922,notsarc,"Actually, it is a mutation. Just like the color of the fur is a mutation. Polar bear fur is not white, it is colorless. Moreover, it is hollow. That is another mutation. And Polar bears have longer legs than their closest relatives, the brown bears. They have smaller ears. None of the changes are caused by ""friction"".By the way, the webs between the toes of a Polar bear are very much like the webs between the toes of a duck.Adaptation is, by the way, evolution. I presume that is the word you meant to use. Adaptation is not adaption. You talk about the process as if it were adaption and then call it adaptation. In reality it is adaptation."
923,notsarc,"Not at all. The issue is receiving the marriage benefits. If gays were given all of the benefits of marriage for just living together, we wouldn't have a fight at all as you would have gotten what you want. It isn't the marriage that is important to you but the benefits. And the debate in Italy of singles who live together seeking marriage benefits also is a good example of the can of worms that will be opened if society concedes to the gay crusaders the undue rights they are demanding.Why is it absolutely impossible for you to reply to an issue without first redefining it to fit your warped World view? Have you no objectivity within you at all?"
924,notsarc,"Please note that I added the word ""human"" to your comment above IANGB. After all it is not my claim that all zygotes are human beings / ""persons."" Agree? Also, I want to make it clear that I am arguing only for the most basic of human rights (life) and not for the full panopoly of rights that say an adult human individual would have."
925,notsarc,The problem here is that Christians (such as I am) consider the Bible to be Proof.
926,notsarc,"I think that's a good question. I also wonder how long the medical establishment has had this rule? Since there must be some long-standing procedures in executions in the United States that require, by law, a doctor's supervision."

928,notsarc,"The whole ""change the definition of marriage"" is mainly a scare tactic used by anti-gay religious bigots. They don't seem to realize that words can have several meanings."
929,notsarc,"But pro-lifers often base the pro-life stance on preventing harm. Not just religion. (And in this case they are one-in-the-same anyway.) This isn't a case of harm-preventative-morality versus religious-morality; it's a case of two harm-preventative moralities in conflict, due to each only focusing mostly on one aspect (either the mother or the unborn baby)."
930,notsarc,But I think that is the point. What if you didn't agree with the germ theory of disease? Does that mean that it shouldn't be taught in health classes in our schools? Should it be replaced by the bad humors of night air theory? But not everyone agrees with that theory either.
931,notsarc,"Well firstly we do not know that ""volition"" must be embodied in living organisms only - computers MIGHT be capable of exhibiting it. I think you will find that there is NO valid reason for believing otherwise. And volition itself is NOT a defining characteristic of life. No biologist would buy that assumption. Sponges, bacteria, corn plants etc etc etc are mindless organisms and so far as can be determined do not act out of volition."
932,notsarc,"That would most likely (imo) reduce the number of abortions performed. It would depend, I think, on how viable it is to transfer the embryo into the artificial womb. Forced surgery would not be an option if I had anything to do about it."
933,notsarc,You should have said that. I might have agreed with you.
934,notsarc,"I think we should not spend inordinate amount of resources on trying to determine who is homeless and if it his own fault. Anyway, whose business is it where someone lives?"
935,notsarc,"On the issue of not living at all i""m not shure there is a reasonable answer as to how someone who was never born could possibly recognise not exsisting as being "" worse than living... ""Let me say I personally don't like the idea of aborting a pregnancy. However I can't possibly understand how we would not FIRST adopt all those kids in homes first and then fight the battel for saving the unwanted unborn."
936,notsarc,"And yet, even though creationists ask for detailed lists of every creature in transition over a period of several million years, I have never found a single creationist who can trace his ancestors back to Adam, a period of only about 6,000 years. The best I can do is to trace my ancestors back to the 1600s."
937,notsarc,"Actually, I don't remember that they did. What they did take bets on was that AIG would be able to find enough stupid people who would buy into their ignorant and scientifically illiterate tripe. As I recall, most who were actually aware of how stupid creationists can be bet that they would be able to do so. So now, besides their other so called 'peer reviewed' magazine, they want to pretend that they are doing science here."
938,notsarc,"Sounds anti-government to me. Are you against your President's economic policies, the fed, bureacracy and tee poor public education?Sounds probably who SEIU should have directed their gall toward and not a man's personal property and family...with the police help of course and purloined school busses. Do the taxpayers owe the SEIU anything? Nope but the SEIU according to CNN owes more than 90 million along with 4 million in interest. Perhaps if they paid their bills they wouldn't add to the public debt by using government property to protest government policy?You wrote it but didn't understand what you wrote...darn public schools emoticonXGood"
939,notsarc,"Well, there are books and scientific journals and what not. This XXXX shows up in my son's science class and he will be hearing each and every day from his mother how it is not science and I will get him access to real science information.
 
 Yikes."
940,notsarc,"What would you know about fair and balanced?emoticonXCensoredI know a lot of truths about gays. Do you want me to start posting incessant threads pointing them all out?And I am the moderator for the formal debate forum, not the entire board. Want to debate me on the benefits of gays on society vs Christianity?"
941,notsarc,"What's ""cumulative selection?"" Do you mean a series of mutations with small but beneficial influence that occur over the period of thousands or millions of years? Just how do you propose to observe such mutations? In fact, we can observe such mutations by comparing the genomes of related species."
942,notsarc,"Not needed? It is evolution. The collor of the moths is genetic - caused by 2 alleles of a single gene. The frequencies of those alleles were observed to change in the populations of moths over many generations. It is by definition, evolution."
943,notsarc,It's still not right for religious people to have to never speak their beliefs. It's a form of tyranny.
944,notsarc,"Form 4473, question 11a reads as follows:11.a. Are you the actual buyer of the firearm(s) listed on this form? Warning: You are no the actual buyer if you are acquiring the firearm(s) on behalf of another person. If you are not the actual buyer, the dealer cannot transfer the firearm(s) to you.Sarah Brady lied on the background check form, she bought the gun on behalf of her son and supplied it to him, thus ensuring that he wouldn't have to worry about the NICS check red flagging him. By gun control standards she's guilty of a straw purchase and should've been sentenced to ten years without parole in a federal prison."
945,notsarc,"That's not what he said. Why do you find it necessary to lie? But of course, you are quoting a news story. I have had experience with news stories that purport to quote what someone has said."
946,notsarc,"Of course not. That battle has already been lost. Creationism is religion and it cannot be taught in a science class, even when it is called ""creation science"" and the data is distorted and mininterpreted. The most recent attempt by creationists in Kansas on the State Board (and yes, they were YECs) was to eliminate all requirements to teach evolution, and all references to an old earth from all curriculum standards."
947,notsarc,Umm...thats the point of saying God of the Gaps - when science fills in the gaps then there is less for your God to do.
948,notsarc,"You realise I'm talking about if the burglar is running away, not the householder, right? Looking at it again I realise I may not have phrased it clearly enough. I'm saying that some of those ""violent"" crimes may simply have been burglars pegging it when disturbed."
949,notsarc,Which falls to logic I laid out in my thread-starting post...
950,notsarc,So what this guy is saying is that he believes in natural selection but not evolution?
951,notsarc,When was the last mass murder at a UK university then?

 Dono"
954,notsarc,"But you know what really doesn't make sense? Why are they evangelising to people (who they know most of them will reject them) if those people get a special dispensation? They'd be condemning people to hell by evangelizing, would they not? Why not leave the people be and let them get the special dispensation? emoticonXConfused"
955,notsarc,"Yes, but what I meant about the legislature passing it is that the legislature could fund it. If there is funding, it becomes a funded mandate. As I've said in the past, though, whether it is classified as an ""unfunded mandate"" or not does not suggest that same-sex marriage is wrong or right."
956,notsarc,"And what is the full quote? Was it talking about, lets say for example, tutles, where over 90 percent of them die before reaching adulthood?In many species, that is true. The 'rule of thumb' is that the more individuals do not reach adulthood, the more offspring that species has."
957,notsarc,"On the contrary, anyone who takes an interest in such things is well placed to appreciate just how hard it is to grasp such distances."
958,notsarc,"I say, since there are medical uses for the stuff, the drug is not pure harm (as the authoritarians assert.) Marijuana has its benefits and harms, and some of these benefits boil down to a matter of personal preference. Illegalizing it, in effect, dictates a personal preference."
959,notsarc,"What is a 'higher' species. If you mean a more intelligent primate?? The concept there is a hierarchy of 'higher' and 'lower' species is incorrect. Theonly difference between man and the other primates is that man has a hyperdeveloped brain. There are two sugars that are naturally produced by body by most mammals. When investingating the presnece of these chemicals, one of them is present in much lower concentrations in the brainsof all mammals. However, humans have a mutation that interrupted the production of this chemical. A piece of random junk got inserted into the middle of the gene that produces this chemical,and disabled it. Sometimes,evolution is not so much about what is added, but what is removed."
960,notsarc,"If you have evidence for something, what purpose is faith with respect to that thing?Faith is belief with no evidence.Or from the dictionary:  Belief that does not rest on logical proof or material evidence.If you verify something scientifically then is it even possible to believe it by faith?"
961,notsarc,"Like the docking simulation, in development there is a pre-existing fitness landscape (the womb). Both processes converge on similar endpoints each time it is run, both process are biased to a few endpoints and both processes reach local optima (e.g. skin"
962,notsarc,"Terrible logic. The first problem is, 99% of the people who truly love Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior are not rapists, murderers, etc. The second problem is, God loving a person and that person going to Heaven are completely different things. It's God's love that allows you to go to Heaven.Crim-"
963,notsarc,"Just like in memetic algorithms, there are many paths to an endpoint. Both memetic algorithms in development and in the docking simulation converge on similar endpoints each time it is rerun. (e.g. skin in development)."
964,notsarc,"You either did not read my post thoroughly, or are intentional misrepresenting me. Post 250 (which I had actually read before starting this thread) is nothing but DamEtel rambling about homologies between vertebrae embryos. That has absolutely nothing to do with the unexplained homologies that the Denton talks about. Evolution simply cannot, reasonably speaking, account for the homology between your arm and leg, among other examples."
965,notsarc,"My point exactly. Carbon dating is by no means accurate, there it does not refute creationism. emoticon_xangel"
966,notsarc,"I believe it's there, but I'm certainly no one to push that belief on anyone."
967,notsarc,"Yes, kind of reminds me of Abraham Lincoln's thought: ""Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt."""
968,notsarc,"And Atilla's army of as many as 1/2 million men was beaten and forced into retreat by the Romans and Visigoths in 451AD. A year later, he was forced to make peace after devastating the Roman countryside...but NOT Rome itself.He died a year later in 453AD."
969,notsarc,"A fairly good explanation, toned down a bit from Darwin's explanation (for the average person who does not have a PHD in biology)."
970,notsarc,"Chloe, the point of this thread is to help you understand what the argument is, not to give analogies to abortion."
971,notsarc,"I am hardly a phyicist, but I am under the impression that there is at least some people who feel there is reason that there are 'uncaused causes'. I think thatthe terms used are 'Vacuum flucuations', and 'virtual particles'. I am not awareof any peer reviewed articles on it , but a popular press book is 'Achilles in the quantum world' by Richard Morris."
972,notsarc,Genes transfered horizontally are as subject to selection as anyother form of gene. Once intergrated into the recieving genome they are simply one more heritable element and if they alter the phenotypes (many are either neutral or even inactivatee) then of course they are subject to selection. Why do you think otherwise? Remember that horizontal transfer is a rare event roughly on a par with ordinary mutations.
973,notsarc,And that is why they are wrong. They don't understand science. Science is not the presentation of proof but explanations of the evidence that have been tested.
974,notsarc,"I did not say that evolution precludes God, all I am saying is that many Atheists seem to think it does, and thus it likely contributes to the number of people who beleive there is no God. If a person does not beleive in God, then they must beleive there is no ultimate morality."
975,notsarc,"He is concerned that you are taking things to far, Simone."
976,notsarc,"Just because we interpret the available evidence differently, for you to assume from that, that we believers know nothing about the universe we inhabit is arrogance to the max."
977,notsarc,"**Here you reveal exactly what I've just spoken of--you assume that science and the scientific method equates to, is synonymous with, materialism/mechanism. It most certainly is not. Nor is the accompanying assumption, i.e., that any science which does not strictly adhere to materialust/mechanist assumptions, is not, and cannot be, real science. Equally untrue.Both assertions are unnecessary to an objective approach to science, per se, but are part and parcel of an emotional defence of materialism/mechanism and its biological aspect, RMNS darwinism."
978,notsarc,"If that was not possible evolution would be impossible, it is direct evidence that evolution isn't impossible not that evolution exists. The same can be said for adaptation, natural selection, and mutation. They are all concepts that evolution stands on but their existance does not necessitate evolutions.For instance if I had the theory: when heavy ceramic objects fall on top of one another a very few super energetic particles fly outwards and cause leaves to fall.I could offer the fact that leaves and bricks do in fact fall, as ""evidence"" for my theory but it would not be in any way that the rising and setting of the sun was not evidence for both rotation and orbit."
979,notsarc,"This is exactly what I said in a pm to her. I also suggested that she talk to women who have had abortions, who have not, who have had adoptions, and who have been adopted. I wish there was some kind of ""place"" you could go to automatically get this kind of dialogue. Not internet sites, but face to face stuff.Want to start a counseling center? :)"
980,notsarc,"Come on, people. You don't butcher an innocent baby for the conveience or sins of the parents. There's plenty of people in the world who would have adopted that baby. And if no one else would have, I would have."
981,notsarc,"They do not differ in any significant way. The living species today closely resemble the fossils. The prediction was made based on the mindset that everything evolved from a common ancestor over billions of years. Furthermore, it was based upon the fossil record, which is supposedly shows how everything evolved."
982,notsarc,And we all know that is what it will become. I'm willing to bet money that Marc is going to argue that abiogenesis is a part of evolution as well as the big bang. There's a clear reason why he won't accept the definitions before the debate starts.
983,notsarc,I see your point and this goes back to my reply that emotions really show nothing as far as being spiritual.
984,notsarc,"And I think it would be good to point out that cannibalism in this context is the eating of human flesh (not necissarily that of a mentally existant human, just the fact that it contains human cells - the same could be said for eating cloned human cells). Otherwise nutjobs like Steeeve, Chloe, and this new SuperSport/EZ clone will start claiming that you have to consider foetuses living human beings for it to be cannibalism, which I am sure they would do."
985,notsarc,"I think you misunderstand my view. I think that a third-term fetus is already sufficiently a person, so I would CERTAINLY consider a newborn baby a person. To me, a person is one who has the most basic, rudimentary sense of thought and emotion. A late-term fetus, from my point of view, is no less a person than an Einstein. An Einstein, of course, is much more useful to a much greater number of people, but from the simple point of view of whether he is more of a person, I would say not."
986,notsarc,"So what is being monitored by the ribosome? Information. Material representations (amino acid sequence vs DNA sequence) of information. But, it does not only monitor it, it manipulates it as a means to an end... fidelity."
987,notsarc,"** Except that hypermutation is not something that happens to a 'cell', but happens to a collectivity of millions of inter-connected, inter-related cells, and that hypermutation in bacteria colonies is not 'stochastic', but 'heuristic', and you are just going to have to accept that those words are not synonyms."
988,notsarc,"So, you are going to ignore the fact that you just suggested that it was the Democrats trying to pass the immigration bill when it was really bipartisan? Really, Phyllis, are you too proud to admit that you were wrong?"
989,notsarc,"Maybe Massachusetts should allow for divorces via notarized mail by non-residents or whatever else is needed to make it easier to do so remotely and more timely, if someone has a serious need to get a legal divorce for such a marriage that only exists somewhere else. What interest would a state that doesn't recognize gay marriage in the first place have in allowing gay divorce?"
990,notsarc,Oddly enough I found Thomas's opinion to be most compelling. The dissent was surprisingly weak...even for a dissent. It didn't even really make sense. The actual opinion was kinda weak but I got bored reading it so I skimmed the second half. Ha.
991,notsarc,"You state ""the woman comes first"". This seems to be your only ""absolute"". Why does the woman come first? Is it because she is fully developed? Is she more important than the child she is carrying?"
992,notsarc,"""He"" is real to all of us fjp, whether we acknowledge Him or not, God is alive and well on Planet Earth. And the day comes for each man when he faces that reality. For some of us it's a long awaited day of joy and for others a long dreaded day. But believe me when I tell you that just because one denies that God exists, it does nothing to lessen His reality."
993,notsarc,"My mom can only trace her family back a few generations. By the time we get to the clan that lived in Ohio in the middle of the 19th century, the records get very confusing and very incomplete. By creationist logic, we must then accept that my ancestors, white Americans, were specially created in North America by God."
994,notsarc,"No, Christianity holds that Jesus IS God. 
 
 That Jesus also is NOT God just shows how contradictory the Bible is for Christians (but they overlook logic and hold blindly to their silly trinity position anyway)."
995,notsarc,"Actually, natural selection tends to preserve a species with only minor changes in a stable environment. But environments tend to change. I don't know what that ""incipient organ"" junk is supposed to mean. Is that another way of saying ""what good is half a wing."" Well, check out a penguin to find out. Look at a seal flipper. It has the same bones, arranged in the same way as a monkey. What good is it for a land animal? And what does ""fully functional"" mean? What function? Perhaps the new organ had a different purpose - take the clawed hands of fossil birds for example. They were good for catching prey and climbing, just like they were for their dinosaur ancestors. But those clawed wings also allowed early birds to fly."
996,notsarc,"False and that doesn't invalide evolution given how it's a misrepresentation of one of the statements in the theory. 
 
 Gould can take his comments and shove them up his ***."
997,notsarc,"Well that may be your contention, but medically that is not necessarily true. Maybe being gay doesn't mean you are suicidal or depressed, but there is more of it going on in the gay life than in the hetero. That in itself is a wake up call. Depression and suicide are harmful, even if it doesn't touch you personally. If it were as simple as you say the APA wouldn't be re-evaluating ""reorientation therapies"" would they and with positive critiques too. You wouldn't have prominent gay activists like Camile Paglia deriding the gay community for being malcontent when those unhappy with being gay seek and desire the way to be hetero."
998,notsarc,"That is not a law to respect, the civil right in the Second Amendment IS!It is unconstitutional to require a license for a right freely given in the Constitution. - Murdoch vs. Pennsylvania plus about 8 more such rulings.You just don't like the BOR brady, that is the Supreme Law of the Land."
999,notsarc,"Hello, please read http://www.reasons.org/resources/apo...ing.shtml?mainIt is a good christian site that explains that there are lots of problems with Dr Russell Humphreys' hypothesis.The universe and Earth are very old. We know this as a fact. Why would God lie to us? If the Universe looks old, then it is. To claim otherwise is to call God a liar."
1000,notsarc,"Actually, I find it near impossible to discuss the second amendment without gun control advocates bringing up the third argument. Weak? Yes. Rare? No.
 
 In my opinion, all arguments in favor of gun control are weak."
1001,notsarc,"But the big bang did not create matter. Matter can neither be created nor destroyed. The matter was already there.You might just as easily ask if god was there to create the universe, where did this god come from.Your answer would be that god has always been there, but I would argue that the matter has always been there. The only difference between these theories is that mine has one less assumption."
1002,notsarc,"The Word of God says otherwise. Romans 1:25-27 - They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creatorwho is forever praised... Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. You've rewritten Biblical Christianity. 2 Timothy 4:3-4 (New International Version) - For the time will come when they will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear."
1003,notsarc,"Well then maybe you can prove it somehow. California has all these laws you support, and even more than that. So if they have these laws on the books and have had them for a while now, and if they're effective at fighting crime, then you must surely have evidence of some sort to prove your case."
1004,notsarc,Kerry is pro-choice. He is in favour of allowing abortions to continue. It matters not why. That's not what we're discussing. It is irrelevant then to speak of the history of the USA etc. I'm not questioning his motives. I'm stating he's in favour of abortion. He is. I quoted from him. You continue supposition that he is not.
1005,notsarc,"So you feel that Mrs Vo should have been allowed to run the risk of dying?
 
 Your statement ""An abortion never has to be done"" only holds true if you place the value of the unborn child over that of the mother in all cases. Do you really believe that?"
1006,notsarc,"I'll address the later question. They may not ""need"" teeth that big, I couldn't say. Just because a creature has a feature doesn't mean its necessary or useful. While evolution does select for useful traits and against harmful traits, that doesn't mean that a trait won't develop that is simply odd. As long as it isn't particularly negative there's no reason to assume it will go away, and so sometimes you get traits that aren't ""useful"", they're simply not harmful. Those teeth could be such a case."
1007,notsarc,"You know what, since simple contradiction without reason while ignoring any responses seems to be good enough for you evolutionist I will simply save my words.
 
 Evolution does not explain the advancement of life.
 
 OHH AHH, beat that one."
1008,notsarc,"Actually, at 24 weeks is when the the interconnection of the fetal brain begins. The nerve cells from the neocortex begin to synapse with the nerve cells of the thalamus. It is at this point that bursts of recognizable brain waves start to appear among the random signals that go on before. It is at this point that some scientists believe a fetus can feel pain as well.It is also at this point that a fetus can possibly survive outside of the womb (23-24 weeks), though the cance of survival is low and the risk of impairment very serious. This point probably won't change with technology either because the fetal lung is not mature enough until this point for even mechanical-assisted breathing."
1009,notsarc,Purposefully communicating information as a means to an end... wound healing.
1010,notsarc,"Who was Isaak? Where did he say this, when did he say this?"
1011,notsarc,"In this case, I will present the Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection as evidence that life is evolving. As the evidence has been shown to support it, you are the person who should be presenting evidence. Currently, your assertion that organisms are ""devolving"" because of mutations has been shown to be faulty."
1012,notsarc,"Being refuted by organized groups with an agenda they support does not make Supwersports ideas wrong. You call it garbage. I AM interested in what Supersport thinks about how his ideas will get wider respect and how he thinks this will change our society.I think this is an important question, because otherwise posting here seems like a kind of mutual masterbation trading facts and arguments that have no effect.Until I hear from SS, I give him the benefit of the doubt."
1013,notsarc,"Well there you go again mixing up a belief in creation (creationists) with a belief that the idea of creation can be based in science (creation science)This is why you are anti-religious in your post. Not everyone who believes in creation, is a creation scientist. I believe in creation, and I'm not a creation scientist, so when you attack us all through confusion, you are, well... attacking us all. Such is your zeal to do so, based as it is, on a philosophy of science."
1014,notsarc,"The ""study"" fails to do this. It offers a philosophical ""proof"" only, as the scientific method is not used in any way in the ""study""."

1019,notsarc,"The laws of physics are short, descriptive statements that describe the operation of certain natural phenomena that always seem to occur in the same way.

1022,notsarc,"They can ""marry"" whomever they love. Benefits though, are a different matter. The state and society views marriage as an opposite-sex institution. It's not about anyone getting harmed; no one said it was."
1023,notsarc,"I believe in a strict interpretation of the Constitution, this makes me neither a liberal or conservative. The SN was inspired by VOR who kept signing his posts with quotes from Karl Marx."
1024,notsarc,"Actually there are already a couple floating around. One fascinating one: Gaia theory and the Daisyworld model. It's all around self-organising systems and the earth as a self-regulating system/organsism/something or other. James Lovelock and co. Interesting to read but sometimes feels a little too 'lets-all-just-get-along' to be real, hard-core theory. Either way, it's probably a lot more likely to be accepted than creationism, should evolutionism for some reason be disproved."
1025,notsarc,"How do you know there isn't a tiger in the bathroom? You feel very strongly and have over-whelming evidence that there is no tiger in your bathroom? (You live in an urban area, there are no zoos, you don't hear scratching or biting or the maiming of your poodle, and the water is going) But you cannot prove a negative. Which is also why you won't be able to prove that creationism is wrong, and why we can't prove evolution is wrong. The focus must be on proving one right. How you might do that depends on your method of reasoning and thought."
1026,notsarc,The thing is the Dempski didn't provide any kind of testable or detectable definition about what information is either. He used vague but scienficially sounding terms to push his case. He knew it too.
1027,notsarc,Well it's more efficient than the bill we just passed...I think we agree that much.
1028,notsarc,"(My evidence does not require this quote, it's for comparison only)The theory of evolution is based on evidence, the existence of god, is not..Reason cannot be applied to it. Furthermore, since evolution relies on reason, faith cannot be applied to it. To attempt to label science as a faith is a contradiction. I know it irks you that your faith cannot be proven, but that's the definition of faith!! It wouldn't be faith without it. As Montalban says in a contradiction of motives: His particular faith does not rest on the foundations of [reason]. Why then look for support from reason?"
1029,notsarc,"Well, I personally agree that I 'spanked' marc9000 (http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=6348). But we'll have to leave it to the judges to make the formal decision."

1031,notsarc,"Oh dear, you're back to your nasty ad hominem self. I could have made fun of the fact that you don't know about materialism, and how its a major force behind evolution. Which is itself a suggestion that you are unaware of the socio-political forces driving western evolutionary theory.**The issue is about people behind sciences, making many different 'sciences'; based on bias, cultural/political/historical. 'Peer' doesn't mean anything because 'peers' are just people with the same background/bias etc.I notice you didn't touch upon Nationalist Sciences. Or for that matter, Capitalist Science.*You mean 'understanding' written English.**I say 'western' because there are other evolutionary theories - Marxist, Nazi, Feminist etc.Thank you, come again."
1032,notsarc,"But you're missing one important fact.
 NONE of those ""reasons"" are required for marriage.
 Absolutely none of them. Any combination of man/woman can marry for whatever reason they want. Even if it's just drunken fun."
1033,notsarc,"And melting the entire surface of the earth and boiling the oceans. Even creationist who propose the nonsense that you spout admit that they have no way to explain where the heat went. In an effort to answer where the water went, they encounter the problem of explaining where the heat went."
1034,notsarc,"Well, what faults? You say that innocent people are sentenced to death far too often. Well, the death penalty does not sentence people, our judiciary system does. The death penalty is mearly a punishment. I will agree that some innocent people have been sent to death row, and when their innocence was discovered, they were released. A perfect judiciary system would not sentence innocent people, and would alleviate all problems with the death penalty. If we had a perfect system and no innocent person was ever sent to death row, we could take them directy from sentencing to a little room beside the courtroom containing a bed and a few drugs, put an IV in them, and carry out the sentence before the jurors got out of the courthouse. Of course, we know that our judiciary system is an imperfect thing, so we understand the need for appeals. "

1037,notsarc,So you're not denying that pro-gun activists in Heller used (or misused) the courts to further their own agenda?
1038,notsarc,BUt it comes down to gay people being harmed by not being allowed to marry. Any time a group is excluded because of someone elses religious beliefs that group is harmed.

If you think that increasing the volume and social acceptance of drug use to the same level of alcohol will 'solve' anything, then you are just an idiot. You have obviously never seen whart drug abuse does to families and people's lives. You're right, alcohol is worse, and the main reason its worse is because of 2 reasons, volume and availability ala social acceptance. Legalizing all drugs would have catastrophic social impacts.Don't feed me that line about taxing it and using the money for rehab. We have taxed the XXXX out of tobacco and alcohol the last 100 years and the last time I checked alcoholism and lung cancer hadn't been erradicated."
1040,notsarc,"Actually, that's not true. While all of the sciences actually support one another, one can be a chemist and not accept evolution. One can even do good science without accepting evolution, but it is difficult. For example, cosmology, astrophysics and astronomy see a very old universe. That's not compatible with young earth creationism. Geology finds an old earth, wich isn't compatible with the mythologies of sacred writings. But that is not to say that one cannot be a qualified scientist and a deist or a theist. There are lots of good Christian scientists who accept evolution."
1041,notsarc,"And yet quantum physics tends to be very contradictory, at least to our perceptions. Acausal events happen. A particle can be in two places at the same time. A particle can disappear and reappear in a different location without traversing that distance. And et cetera.Since the beginning of our local universe occurred at quantum levels, I would be cautious about drawing philosophical conclusions based on our macro-world experiences."
1042,notsarc,"Did you read the article? A capuchin is type of monkey, in this case, the type that was used in the experiment."
1043,notsarc,"this is where the most confusion comes in, and why many evolutionist that are particular about the definition of evolution gets into arguments. #3 is the only one close to the scientific definition, and still this is technically lacking and only serves the very layman levelyou continue to insist that all misinformation is a result of YEC's distorting the definitions. YEC's didnt write the definitions in dictionary.com, noe the hundreds of other dictionarys that have similar definitions. furthermore, your definitions have done nothing to educate people who are seeking more information. they only serve to display your disdain for creationists and your lack of objectivity"
1044,notsarc,"It's the first couple of paragraghs from the article in this weeks NS. If you had an online subscription or got a copy from your newsagent you could read the whole thing, unfortunately with this one the intro rambles on a bit and doesn't get to the point till the second column..."
1045,notsarc,On what grounds do you seek to redefine the institution of marriage from it's accepted standard in this country?
1046,notsarc,"But, it is a new TYPE of butterfly. 
 
 It would be more like if a bonobo and a human had a child. That is theorotically possible..."
1047,notsarc,"Congratulations. You are now part of a minority group. Marriage tends to either work or it doesn't. I know, brilliant observation. What I mean is either the couple is together for decades or spend x amount of years being unhappy until the unhappy is more than the baggage of divorce."
1048,notsarc,"how many animals do you think were on the Ark? how many species existed at the time?
 
 the story of the ark does not coincide with contemporary science, but it does work with the rest of Genesis. this is Genesis 2: 15-23"
1049,notsarc,"Well, thank you for this thread Santafeur. I must say though that I peruse various threads just to read stuff. The C vs. E topic does not strike a nerve with me. In fact, I also wonder what it is about the human mind that makes people so desperate to want to know how we came about. What difference does it make? We are here now. Could we possibly just accept that we got here somehow, and just move on?"
1050,notsarc,"I don't see how one can be a agnostic and be a Deist either. Deism requires a origin, some form of a clockmaker. To not be sure that such a being exists is to fail one of the most basic ideas of Deism."
1051,notsarc,"Oh I hated being pregnant. However I am not really arguing whether pregnancy in and of itself is punishment, I suspect that is an opinion matter - there are some crazy women who actually liked pregnancy. ;) Julie - however clearly feels that it is acceptable to use a pregnancy and parenting in a punitive matter against women she feels are irresponsible."
1052,notsarc,"Again, it's not just 'evidence' but 'evidence constructed into a workable theory'."
1053,notsarc,"Yes, you do have a problem with Archaeopteryx. You can't explain it from a creationist point of view. I'm not claiming that it is a ""link,"" whatever that may be. It is a transitional form. It is a small theropod dinosaur that has characteristics that are common to theropod dinosaurs and only theropod dinosaurs and their ancestors. It also has characteristics that exist in birds and only birds. Some characteristics exist in both. The furcula, for example. A furcula has been identified in some theropods, but it is rather rare and then only imprefectly preserved. An indication that it may be mostly connective tissue. Archaeopteryx has a furcula. But even at that it doesn't compare to the same structure in birds. It is intermediate. Imagine that!"
1054,notsarc,You say that alot but discussion is about taking other people seriously.

1072,notsarc,"This is a pretty loose definition.It's like saying you have faith that Jesus will come again because you personally witnessed his ressurection.But you didn't, you have faith because you believe this with absolutely no material evidence or logic to back it up."
1073,notsarc,"I did not say that violent crime ""rarely"" occurs, merely that the risk of being a victim of such is lower relative to other risks. I am genuinely curious if you care as much about protecting your heart as you care about protecting yourself from criminals."
1074,notsarc,Well both could be a good mother because i know a mother who was very certain she didn't want her baby and went for an abortion but was too late on in her pregnancy to have one and then she was going to give himup fpr adoption but as soon as he was born she loved him and couldn't bear to give him up and know she's a great Mum. Being a good mother mainly depends on what you are like with you're child after birth.
1075,notsarc,"Well, all I can say then is that no action is just about as bad as failed action, and IS as bad in terms of anything current. Either way you don't have gay marriage. You have a majority in Congress right now, and you're not demanding much change just because of fear of backlash? Yeah, there would be backlash. Heck, the Civil War was the ultimate backlash, but that didn't stop abolitionists from demanding more than TOKEN change, and it's a good thing they did. It's your gig, though, so do what you want. I don't see much point in laboring this discussion any more; I'm just pointing out my observations."
1076,notsarc,"It is clearly not a strawman argument. I think he doesn't know what ""straw man"" means and I think he is meaning to say ""red herring.""It isn't a red herring either; it's a perfectly logically related question. I would guess he doesn't see that as he neither understands evolution nor bacterial resistance and, thus, the relationship."
1077,notsarc,"Well, ya know, if you actually, oh I don't know, VISITED THE SITE, you'd see that the ""friendlyatheist.com"" is a blog-like page (and not the one that is actually giving the info on the evolutionary migration of humanity) and it gave a link to the actual website that we are talking about (the second link I gave): http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/journey/But then, maybe we're expecting a little too much from a creationist. emoticonXBanghead emoticonXBanghead"
1078,notsarc,No but the fact that infants have brain activity makes them a world of difference between a zygote that has no brain activity. They can think and feel and exhibit all the characteristics of other human beings. A zygote exhibits none of those characteristics.
1079,notsarc,"Well, by the strict defintion of the word ""born"", an abortion is considered a premature birth."
1080,notsarc,"Really??? You think most people would incorporate the golden rule? I don't think so--I think most people are willing to make a buck off of others (business ventures), land that job they want before someone else gets it, curse someone for cutting them off in traffic, get that parking spot before the guy coming around the corner gets it, or even get in an intentionally insulting dig to someone in a discussion forum such as this. The examples could go on and on ... I think a lot of people like to THINK they incorporate the golden rule, but at close, honest examination would find that they rarely do."
1081,notsarc,"Because the men who wrote it mixed their mythology in with their heros. The first 11 chapters of Genesis are obviously mythology. And if what you say is true, then I guess that means that the Illiad is historical. Why would Homer be right about some lives and events, but wrong about others? And of course, there are other parts of the Bible that are pure fiction - Jonah and Job for example."
1082,notsarc,"Right. We are explaining natural phenomena by natural means. We do so simply because we can test natural explanations while we cannot test the supernatural. We use methodological naturalism (not, by any means, philosophical naturalism) to observe, test and explain the natural. This is not a denial of god or an assumption about the existance of a god. It is a recognition of the fact that we cannot investigate the supernatural by natural means. Even methodological naturalists can be theists - Kenneth R. Miller for example."
1083,notsarc,"No, it is not a bad deal for the child. However, my beliefs do not permit murder, even if it is a better ""deal""."

1085,notsarc,"This is a very simple, easily answerable question. Most people, especially in America, have problems with people telling them what to do. Teenagers hate being under the authority of adults. Adults hate being under the authority of the government and enforcers of the law. Everyone in the world is under worldly authority, but to actually have a God who created you, which gives him the right to make commandments stating what is good for you and what is not, that makes most people really XXXXXX off. "
1086,notsarc,"So what's the deal when GWB ""gives"" $3,000 but the insurance premiums cost $6,000, the family can't make up the difference and the $3,000 goes unspent. All we've accomplished is to transfer $ out of the U.S. Treasury. You think it's a good idea to just give money away and not get anything for it? You're thinking of the Clinton years when there was a surplus."
1087,notsarc,"You lost this debate Skeptic, why drag it back up again? There are plenty of other subjects that we could debate instead. Pick one of them and let's debate again. Alternatively, how about a formal debate on ID in which you never once mention Behe? That'll be a completely different one and worth considering."
1088,notsarc,"Simone is quite right...women will no longer breed to order according to the dictats of outdated religion. British Muslim women will follow at some point (many already are). There are a few hothead extremists who sit on London street corners with placards stating that ""UK will be Islamic"", ""Sharia Law for UK"" etc. etc. But those nutters are ignored along with all the other (non-religious) nutters currently walking the streets of London. (For the record, Muslims make up 2.1 per cent of the total United Kingdom population. They are hardly ""taking over"" ).""muslims are taking over the world"" is a poor excuse of a reason to be anti-abortion and shows desperation, IMO!"
1089,notsarc,"oh yeahrubbish rubbish,scientifically speaking, human life (using a most bsic term) begins at conception. the twins exist as two seperate entities the moment each contains the individual human dna. seems to me you better be certain when it begins before you go around ending it. if you are driving at night an you ""think"" you might see a person ahead in the middle of the road you are hopefully not gonna drive over that person. Instead that uncertainty should lead you to stop. If you dont like that example, consider a hunter who is unsure what is in the bushes."
1090,notsarc,"It should be noted that other exotic amino acids are also used by a few other codes (derived form the original). E.g. Selenocysteine and pyrrolysine are encoded for in many archaea and vertebrates. Archaea, however seem to be the most primitive organisms, thus these encoded amino acids must have been fixated early on.Thus an interesting question can be applied to an ""evolving"" code as posited in the above quote:Are these ""still evolving"" mRNAs, still evolving? Or did it hit an inevitable global optimum? Secondly, from the article:"
1091,notsarc,"That's not quite true either. Federal laws grant many rights and privledges to married people. The feds may not have a say on who can get married, but there are federal laws that benefit married people."
1092,notsarc,Do you see the other cities pushing for outrageous standards like NYC?
1093,notsarc,"I suggested nothing. You are reading into this some thing that is absent. ""The nurse then informed me, if I had answered yes to any of the questions, I would have lost my concealed carry permit as it would have gone into my medical records and the VA would have reported it to Homeland Security. Looks like they are going after us vets."""
1094,notsarc,"But bestiality consists of animal cruelty, so very much hurts another. Just not another human."
1095,notsarc,But faith is not religion. Religion is the expression of belief in a god or higher being or power of the supernatural.As an agnositc I think that both theists and atheists are wrong since it is impossible to know for sure wheither a god exists or not while one is still alive.
1096,notsarc,Good old monkeys! What can't we learn from them :)Since we are in the Creation vs Evolution section I'm guessing that your debate here is that monkeys and humans show some similar ways of thinking such as in this experiment. It does seem like further evidence that evolution did take place between our two species although it isn't a case cracker by any means.
1097,notsarc,"No one said he invented guns!A straw man argument is an informal fallacy based on misrepresentation of an opponent's position.[1] To ""attack a straw man"" is to create the illusion of having refuted a proposition by substituting a superficially similar proposition (the ""straw man""), and refuting it, without ever having actually refuted the original position.[1][2]"
1098,notsarc,"Holy grail implies it is like a religion, which it is not. If evidence is found that overturns this theory, it will be discarded in favour of a better one."
1099,notsarc,I have noticed he seems content to drop a Ad Hominem neglecting to actually argue.
1100,notsarc,"Just as you make certain assumptions that never change regarding evo, so does the Creationist hold that certain absolutes exist regarding Creation, such as a personal God created all that is. We understand science can't prove God which is a huge stumbling block for the evolutionist, but isn't one at all for us because we can see the spiritual which evades the scientific perspective at all levels of understanding. And ID would insist that it is evolution that's the atheistically motivated pseudo science, so we will continue to disagree there also."
1101,notsarc,"Nope. Frame-shifts move the whole code down one step, making entirely new genes. Often, this is disastrous, but sometimes, a useful new enzyme results.Barbarian observes:It's remarkable then, how much progress we've made. You may or may not approve of the theory, but it works very well at learning more about biology.And, as you may have noticed, we've been very successful at interpreting the data. We've learned to do a lot of things as a result. One of the most important reasons scientists accept the theory is that it works."
1102,notsarc,"No I'm not Kronus. I haven't made excuses for him or denied what he did. OP said he is a conservative Christian which is a lie and I'm exposing that lie for what it is. Unless she can prove he is anything more than a conservative secular Republican, then he is no more a morally responsible person than an atheistic democrat. To attempt to mark all fundamental christians with the actions of this guy because he's a republican is a truly fallacious argument and a slanderous lie regarding me and all believers. None of this excuses what Vitter himself is responsible for doing. But she is wrong for immorally attempting to paint us all as adulterers because of his sin."
1103,notsarc,But the military is pretty much all a volunteer thing. It's not a hiring process--employer/employee thing. That arrangement lends itself more to the soldier not volunteering for service in the first place.
1104,notsarc,I'll assume this is figurative since they do not literally melt.
1105,notsarc,"Nice raising the bar. Fallacies are a creationist's best friend. You claimed:""have never shown to add any new structure or even a new part to any existing structure.""Now you are changing your argument away from structure as new proteins and especially enzymes (which are proteins) don't count."
1106,notsarc,"True but this progesses nothing twoards a conversation because you have no told me the nature of such an existance.
 
 You have said if A is then A=A.... thats saying a lot without saying anything at all because you have failed to provide what A is."
1107,notsarc,"It hasn't happened yet is not absolute proof, just that it makes the probability of it being wrong quite small. By the way, if you are in the least bit intellectually honest, I challenge you to actually act on any of those doubts about the reality of existence and any other reality that we understand from all human experience. Otherwise, if you never act on those doubts, you are simply being hypocritical."

 You have not had many REAL conversations with pro-choicers then.
 
 The Planned Parenthood Motto is ""EVERY CHILD A WANTED CHILD.'"
1109,notsarc,"Actually, if you look at the example I've given, that's false. The probability of A in one organism may be low, but the probability of A in some organism approaches 100% as the population and the number of generations gets larger. And if A is useful and comes to dominate the population, then the probability of an AB individual appearing then also tends towards 100%. In the example above, the chance of an AB mutant occurring, if A and B are substantially useful mutations, is almost a dead certainty. It would be amazing if they didn't stack. So saying that AB occurring is less likely than A is misleading at best, downright wrong at worst. Behe is clearly misapplying probability theory."
1110,notsarc,"And he accomplished all this human carnage without a gun. This just proves that if it was possible to eliminate all projectile firing weapons from existing on earth, men would find a way to commit atrocities against his own kind just as he did before such weapons existed if murder was in his heart. Guns are not the issue, the corrupted heart/nature of humanity is."

1116,notsarc,"Very well said. However, we also believe that gun owners should get as much training as possible, necessary, desired etc. It just should not be required to participate in a Right Recognized by your Constitution as Inalienable, and therefore protected.

1118,notsarc,"Well, in the case above, it was step-by-step. First, an existing enzyme was modified to a new use, and over time, became refined to work better and better. This is the way evolution works. Nothing is de novo; it's always a modfication of something else. Second, a mutation produced a regulator that only allowed the enzyme to be produced if the substrate was available. Again, this was refined by natural selection over time. In the end, the newly-evolved system was irreducibly complex, because all three parts have to be present for the system to work. And do show us your numbers proving that such processes can't produce new information. If you don't know how, I'd be pleased to show you how a mutation changes the information in a population."

1120,notsarc,"Well, that was a bait-and-switch but it wasn't very masterful. Actually, there are two color morphs in arctic foxes that are determined by a single locus. You are incorrect to claim that the brown morph becomes pure white. That is incorrect. It becomes a very light brown and appears to have a blue sheen. That is why it is known as the ""blue morph"". The ""white morph"" is a light brownish gray in summer and becomes pure white in winter. However, the fact that arctic foxes do (not can) change color seasonally is not evolution. All arctic foxes always do change color with the seasons (it happens much quicker than the ""matter of months"" that you state), and that isn't evolution. It is evolution that the arctic foxes, like many other northern and arctic animals like the Mustelidae, have evolved the ability to change colors with the seasons."
1121,notsarc,"That's not something you can really blame on the pro-life movement. In fact, a lot of effort in the pro-life movement does go into helping single mothers. Many pro-life counseling services help single mothers offering support in a variety of ways, including financially."

At this point, I actually have you questioning Planned Parenthood's definitions? QUOTE; "
1123,notsarc,"Yes, but we do not know that homosexuality is not inherited, and it is the arguments like this that make people want to prove that homosexuality is genetic. Also, people born infertile cannot reproduce, so are those people inferior in a relationship because of what they cannot do?"

1128,notsarc,"No it doesn't. First, the changes may not be neutral. I will presume that you are intelligent enough to grasp that idea the mutations in and of themselves are neither advantagous nor disadvantageous, and the they have no purpose. Evolution happens when the mutations (and other mechanisms that increase genetic diversity) are acted upon by other mechanisms of evolution. Even in natural selection there is no purpose. Natural selection is differential reproductive success. Some organisms tend to produce more offspring because they have characteristics that give them an advantage in a particular environment."

1140,notsarc,"Well, it does say on the site ""Any concealed handgun permit holders who are eventually acquitted of their alleged crimes are not included in the tallies maintained on the site although the facts surrounding the shooting are detailed.""So if you go to their pdf file you can still find out details about the very few cases that were acquitted or dismissed:http://www.vpc.org/fact_sht/ccwtotalkilled.pdf"
1141,notsarc,"As proved above by definition of reason above, it all depends on what premise or starting assumption you have as to what conclusion you will reason out. You are correct that faith does not neccessary require evidence. But there is usually always evidence to support the validity of a particular faith, in this case Christianity."
1142,notsarc,"Greater legal minds than yours or mine see laws against same-sex marriage as unconstitutional ""limiting"". Quibble with them if you want, but that's how they put it."
1143,notsarc,"Well, I would agree that as many constitutional ammendments probably would not have passed, but I certainly don't think they all would not have been passed, and I don't think that Massachusettes allowing same-sex marriage was a bad thing. Constitutional ammendments are difficult to overcome, but no one can ever change a law if people aren't willing to take a stand and fight for it.Can you tell that I love the quote in Jyoshu's signature?"
1144,notsarc,"That's right, a higher view of the fetus than there currently is typically in our culture. I have no problem with anyone referring to it that way."
1145,notsarc,I think that the type of weapon does make a difference. A tyrant would be more dangerous to the world if he was armed with WMDs rather than knives.
1146,notsarc,"Well this involves the free will / determinism debate, you say you aren't free if your preferences are implanted... I say you are free when you act in accordance with your preferences, regardless of how those preferences were arrived at. I think to claim you need to ""choose"" your preferences is absurd, as the act of choosing requires prior preferences, which presumably also required a choice.... and the question of how we acquired our first preference arises..."
1147,notsarc,"To the extent that working toward social change on any moralistic issue is an 'imposition', sure. But I think one could say that about anything that has a social effect."
1148,notsarc,They are not exactly the same. See the examples above. It is not random.
1149,notsarc,"SNIP
 
 This isn't evidence, this is an opinion piece made by someone with an agenda. Come back when you have something of substance."
1150,notsarc,"First of all rape is one of the most under-reported crimes so it makes sense that abortion due to rape/incest is also under-reported so that makes your assumptions and numbers off.But of course you are missing the whole point.You are not the one being raped so it isn't YOUR choice.I don't need you making choices for me or telling me what is and isn't good for my emotional health.If one gets raped and DOES NOT want to be pregnant who are you tell them they have to be? Abortion should be legal for everybody who wants one not just rape/incest victims,for the simple reason that no human being has the right to substain life by using the body of another why should a fetus have more rights than actual persons?"
1151,notsarc,"Really, with C being between 1/2 and 2 million defensive gun uses per year. Or perhaps the hundreds of millions of legal, non-defense related, gun uses per year. When you compare the number times a guns are used legally to the number of times they are used illegally, B becomes pretty insignificant."
1152,notsarc,So? The point was that people who support gun control are not necessarily communists.
1153,notsarc,"Notice that even in this version there are elipses just before the quote in question. My bet is if we were to actually refer to this 44 years old book, Simpson would not be saying what Toxey wants him to say."
1154,notsarc,"The first article is from 2002 and the second one is from 2006, molecular genetics changed massively over that period of time with the completition of the human genome project and the development of new technology. What they would be looking at and comparing would have changed drastically as well, from just the genes in the first case (the 99% figure) and everything in the second (94%)."
1155,notsarc,Out-and-out lie. There's really no other way to put this.
1156,notsarc,Evolutionary scientists is a confusing term. A geochronologist might work out an age for a lava sample for example. Astronomers have also made comment on the age of the earth as have paleontologists studying certain fossils.So why would no flood make radiometric much more likely to accurate as you say? Can we hear some specific detail on this as it is kinda significant to backing you your assumption.
1157,notsarc,"Well, that is not what your colleagues quoted herein seem to feel... and that certainly is not what empirical evidence is bearing out. Evolution simply put, is the creation story for secular humanists and nothing more, which in and among itself if fine - I don't personally care if believe we evolved from Mountain Dew, but don't try to pass that off as fact when there is substantial evidence that says otherwise. I am sorry... you have not made a convinving arguement here... and I dare say save your breath, you never will."
1158,notsarc,And I've never seen anyone present observational evidence that would indicate that all creatures were specially created. Please do so.
1159,notsarc,"And the point was, Benjamin, that it is dishonest to cite the work of others, with no indication that it is the work of others. If you take what someone else wrote, they you need to indicate that, telling where you got it. If it is a book, then the author, title, publisher, date and page. If it is a web page, then the URL should be given.Even better, express your own point and tell how reference supports it. Tell why it is important and why it shows your opponent wrong - then just give a link. Generally AIG is really bad science and isn't very interesting. It is misleading, intentionally. However, on these boards are familiar with their stuff."
1160,notsarc,Do you think that the woman will not relive the rape on a daily basis if she destroys the child? Not likely. I think she will still suffer through those thoughts. Killing the baby complicates this. What happens if she has horrible thoughts about a rape with more thoughts about the abortion?
1161,notsarc,"Actually, I am of the opinion that the fetus has no natural rights of its own. Any rights we grant to a person as a citizen or national are granted at the moment of birth. By granting equal rights to a 3week old fetus that you do to a 20 year old man, you are endangering the rights of the woman who carries that child. Yes, I believe that in most circumstances, the child should be carried to term, but there are exceptions to every rule, and I'm not quite ready to forsake the lives and health of women to protect unborn children. Yes, I think the unborn child is worthy of protection, but not any more so than the mother, in fact probably less."
1162,notsarc,"Actually, it's not conjecture. The genetic makeup of the several subspecies of arctic foxes bear it out. The dominant allele is rare because it is less adaptive. The dominant allele is most likely ancestral. But even foxes below the Arctic circle show differences in their fur between summer and winter. So yes, foxes that were able to change color in the north had a differential reproductive advantage over those who couldn't."
1163,notsarc,"Please define ""climb upward"" and ""downhill slide"" in biologically meaningful terms. Please define ""degeneration."""
1164,notsarc,"True, but what i was trying to state is that the bible has little to do with christianity if you dont believe in it. I know many christians who believe in god, and jesus etc, but think the bible is completely false, and is only a book of fables. Thats what i was trying to imply."
1165,notsarc,"Because the 'founding fathers' were not as foolish and gullible as people like you (especially, in foreign countries) to believe that ANY form of government is above the possiblity of tyranny against it's citizens."
1166,notsarc,"Not only do their superiors in higher courts think they are a joke, but their peers in other circuit courts think they are a joke."
1167,notsarc,"And here our Government recognizes:

1168,notsarc,"But what about the married couple who know right up front they do not intend to have children, don't even intend to try? Do we ban them from marriage to?"
1169,notsarc,"Very many have: dolphins and whales, for example, and some cave-dwelling birds."
1170,notsarc,"And here we have a leading YEC showing how he starts with his preexisting religious position and is not about to change it, no matter what the scientific evidences show."
1171,notsarc,"because all children should have parents who want them dearly.btw, ""moral relativism"" is absurd. a phase people pass through as they discover diversity and is bewildered by it, thinking all are equally valid. it is a stance of both immature/superficial reasoning and moral depravity."
1172,notsarc,I'll let you know to what extent the movie documents it. I'm off to see it in a few. :)
1173,notsarc,"Yes I know, a lot of people have done a lot of work to try to refute Behe's work. From your link;"
1174,notsarc,You only say that it won't make a change because you support the effects it will have.
1175,notsarc,"Because self-defence, unlike most other 'reasons', automatically allows all citizens firearm access, and in most cases allows firearm acess without mandatory training/evaluation. When this occurs, you are much more likely to get misuse of firearms.If you read around you'll see that I consider all rights as needing justification. This comes both from my stance as a relativist and as a UK citizen, where there is no formalised Constitution. Ask yourself this - if a right cannot be justified, why should it be treated as a 'right'?"
1176,notsarc,"Yes, the Byzantines are a Catholic Rite. The Catholic Church is divided into rites- there are seven I believe, the Roman, of course, being the largest. The Byzantine Catholics are an Eastern Catholic Rite, and as you said are almost identicle to the Orthodox Churches except that they acknowledge the Pope as the head of the Church.East to West, a website regarding all the churches of the Catholic Church, especially those of the east.Real quick, the Orthodox acknowledge the Pope as the successor of Peter, but not as the head of the Church. Am I correct?"
1177,notsarc,"Since when does the fate get decided by the victim? A woman could be said to have a biased opinion on it because she is an involved party. Even so, I take the stand that no one has any authority over the other to make that decision."
1178,notsarc,"Actually, scientists who discard the global flood are taken seriously."
1179,notsarc,"Actually, I believe that there IS not entity that is supernatural, and therefore do not have to define it any further than that. It is the believer that has to define it futher,.. which often they don't."
1180,notsarc,"If the justification for morality is obedience to a divine authority, it has no place in a public school. Those without religious beliefs are not by definition immoral."
1181,notsarc,"In case you were wondering, no one here has missed the fact that you're trying to divert attention from the real issues by beating one minor issue into the ground."
1182,notsarc,"Your claim is not supported in the least. If we look to the landmark abortion case Roe v. Wade, we find that it was not women seeking abortions that were punished, but the people who procured the abortion that were. It would be the same if abortion were again made illegal. To prove this, we need only to look at a recent abortion regulatory statute: the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. Needless to say, there are far less doctors who perform abortions than there are women who seek them, and because it was not a problem executing abortion law prior to 1973, it likewise won't be a problem executing abortion law should abortion be made illegal again."
1183,notsarc,"so what about jesus' life is credible if the source is unreliable? was it that jesus didnt walk on water but he fed 5000 with 5 loaves? was it that he didnt forgive the samaritan harlot but he raised lazarus from the dead? what did the authors get right? i mean, i can easily believe jesus said he came to bring a sword and not peace. but you dont. so how do we possibly pattern our lives according to how jesus lived if we dont know whether what they recorded was actually what he did?it is necessary to believe that the gospels are true, otherwise you cannot follow a pattrn you dont have."
1184,notsarc,"Not many women would say they had an abortion now, let alone back when it was illegal.It is an emotionally trying event. I can understand why she wouldn't for that reason alone. Another possibility is that the Administration is buying her silence, or it could be a combination of the two."
1185,notsarc,"Just as you are uninformed on the other subject?
 I honestly believe that is the only reason you don't at least partially accept evolution."
1186,notsarc,"That's because these questions were never, ever, EVER raised in the original Parker case. None of the six DC people who took the city to court possessed a felony record, they didn't bring up anything other than the fact that DC made it impossible for them to legally buy and own a handgun. That's all the court addressed. If they addressed anything else in the Heller case it would've been judicial activism, legislating from the bench."
1187,notsarc,"If everytime I say something you(you in the general sense) bring out ""that is oppressive to women"" then please don't bother posting. If you don't believe in it you don't...I guess you could say if you don't support drugs you are oppressing the drug users....but you really arent."
1188,notsarc,"Again, this wasn't just about you and me. I do think you corrected someone's spelling and if you didn't it was another creationist."
1189,notsarc,Right. And that is the reason for peer review. Creationists don't subject their ramblings to peer review. That is why so much care is devoted to the proper construction of experiments to test the hypotheses by real scientists. Creationists just invent ad hoc stories without any experimentation.
1190,notsarc,"Actually, I've been posting more than ever...just not here. This place has become gay central and it bored me. I posted the above because I knew it was a topic near and dear to both of our hearts. emoticon_xkill emoticon_xgood"
1191,notsarc,"They are safer. The 300 gun deaths per year rate has dropped since then.Let's have a little reality intrude on the gun porn fantasies. Only 13% of Swiss homes ever had an Army-issue weapon in them, Militia service extending only from age 20 to age 30, and the ammunition was stored in a sealed pack, with severe punishments for the seal being broken."
1192,notsarc,And they have been found in volume buried together in the same strata in Ohio also. Vertebrate Fossils - Ohio History Central - A product of the Ohio Historical Society
1193,notsarc,"But it took a lot longer to develop. My point was that only after about 5000 years of human civilization did empiricism as science develop. Religion, supernaturalism, and mythology trace back into prehistory. What we know as science didn't even begin to exist until the late 1500s and 1600s. Before that it was OK to do science like Aristotle did - no experiment, only thinking about a logical answer. Thus, heavy objects fell faster than light ones and any fool could tell that the sun orbited the earth.But science is more than an inner way of thinking. It is a process and a method for learning about the universe. It is called methodological naturalism. That is not to say the science asserts that nothing exists except what is natural. It says that science can't study the supernatural."
1194,notsarc,The article said very little about his observations and almost nothing about his methods.
1195,notsarc,"And if they are governed and regulated people can be victimized by the system. In fact, the regulation might be the very thing victimizing people. Again, it isn't the system but the people who are in society that make a morality."
1196,notsarc,"It is worse then that they just don't get it. Once you put some civil rights on the ballot nothing is off limits. Freedom of speech, religion, assembly ect.. they are all up to be voted out of existence for an unpopular minority by the majority. They just don't get it."
1197,notsarc,So what? If somebody wants to die then they'll kill themselves no matter what.
1198,notsarc,"He had ALREADY MADE the animals. ""now the Lord God HAD FORMED..."" not ""now the Lord God formed..."" See the difference? He already HAD FORMED the animals before he brought them to Adam. He made the animals before Adam."
1199,notsarc,"logic would lead one to believe abortion is wrong...but why be consistent in your thinking.The point is, logic and rational thinking is not a requirement to make a law. You can ban abortion is you want...the states did it and the constitution allows it, even if 5 legislatures think otherwise."
1200,notsarc,"Actually, there is no such thing as ""an evolutionary mutation of a gene."" A mutation is a mutation. For evolution to have occurred requires neither that a mutation be new nor useful and they don't require new structures nor structures.Here's a little mental exercise for you. At most, a person can have only two alleles for any gene. This would have been the condition of the human race 6,000 years ago according to creationists. It would not have been possible for there to be more than 2 alleles for any given gene. Now consider that for every gene in the human genome there is an average of 14 different alleles, sometimes more, sometimes less. Where did all of those alleles come from?"
1201,notsarc,"**Nor do I think you at all stupid. I do not debate stupid people, there is no challenge in it. Nor do I debate arrant foolishness and irrational notions such as biblical literalism. It's no more challenging than shooting fish in a barrel, and no more satisfying than destroying a child's faith in the tooth fairy.But I do take offence at you characterizing my ability to reason logically and to think with some originality as being nothing more than 'manipulation' and sophistry."
1202,notsarc,"So every woman who has an abortion lives an irresponsible life. Care to give any examples, or are you just spouting rubbish with no experience or knowledge whatsoever?"
1203,notsarc,They don't have to. The government is exercising violence by threatening people with jail time if they cause injury to somebody else who's attacking them.
1204,notsarc,"The dictionary.com definition is vague, whether you use all 5 divisions of the definition, or only the first one that you quoted. I think that's what Grocott was saying - that it's not definable in a precise, non controversial way so that everyone can agree on exactly what it includes and what it does not. Even the word ""phenomena"" is vague. The reason I said (and maintain) that it's a murky combination of facts and theories is because it can branch off in different ways and follow different paths, depending on the presuppositions (worldviews) of those assigned the duty of directing it. In this case it's the teaching establishment. There is only a finite amount of instruction time in schools. Some paths get more time, attention, and detail allotted to them than do other paths. "
1205,notsarc,"Actually, the storm lasted for 40 days and 40 nights. The ark was actually afloat for a year or so. So I guess the answer is that the ark had all kinds of pestilent insects winging about and biting and stinging the occupants. The problem is, how did these aquatic breeders actually propagate in the feces and urine infested bilge of the ark?"
1206,notsarc,"Again, nonrandom is not the same as Lamarckian. Phenotypic variation can be nonrandom because the organisms can select the most attractive/successful mates with whom to breed. Once again, you're totally stuck on one aspect of the ToE, random mutation; the ToE is much more than that."
1207,notsarc,So the founding fathers and their work is basicy viewed as an authority based on their competence?
1208,notsarc,"You know that under most public healthcare systems you can still buy private care if you really want to, don't you?As for OldSarge's claim of bean pushers deciding what care you get, isn't another name for them ""claims adjustors""?

He doesn't have to call anyone to check the funding is there, if it's covered for anyone, it's covered for me as well."
1209,notsarc,"Because quite simply, it is all what we observe. One has never observed a mutation that has been seen to increase the information in the genome. If there have been any mutations that have led to an increase in information, please state it."
1210,notsarc,"Yea, i got one about the UK. Let me find it, hold on."
1211,notsarc,"well heck, if lifeforms cannot realistically be strung together by small, gradual, materialist increments (which they can't and there is no evidence for) then the only alternative is special creation."
1212,notsarc,"Actually it started when they wrote the consitution - you can practice your religion, but you can't make me do it or even give a flying monkeys XXX about it."
1213,notsarc,"Thomas favored incorporation through priviledges and immunities, correct?That likely makes the most sense but the Court probably feared how far that could go, since the logical conclusion is the abolition of individual State law. Not that the ""substantive due process"" is well defined, but likely the Court felt they could rein in any excesses through that interpretation."
1214,notsarc,"Well, it might help if you could propose a mechanism for such changing traits that would stand up as well as the current model of genetic inheritance."

1219,notsarc,"Actually, it is. There are multitudes of known characteristics that have been shown to be the result of a single point difference in the gene. The discovery of regulatory functions of some translated segments of DNA does not in any way discount what is known about gene function."
1220,notsarc,"But does anyone actually need a marriage to do this? No.
 Are there any laws stating one must be married before giving birth? No."

Yesterday, a spokeswoman for the Delaware Department of Justice said it misinterpreted the law and that Brady was not obligated to state that the gun was for her son as long as he was legally qualified to own a firearm.""In addition, a spokesman for Brady said, 'Sarah Brady told the gun store that the gun was for her son and filled out the forms that they asked her to fill out.'""The News regrets the error.""CORRECTION"
1228,notsarc,"And what did I say? 
 
 I quoted the title of the video, said ""Enjoy"" and labeled the link ""link""
 
 So how is saying ""enjoy"" and ""link"" which were MY words mockery? The only thing that suggests otherwise is the VIDEO's Title, which I did not create."
1229,notsarc,"Well, I didn't really mean to go that far. But I'm talking about problems like that all worked out, thought about previously, and that the problem was worked out. I'm talking more about, what if you could make laborers stronger, scientists smarter, and rid us of physical and mental abnormalities ( such as down syndrome, narcolepsy, etc.). I don't think of making everyone the same for that reason. I'm just saying, what if there was a way to better society without going overboard? If the problems were worked out, which I'm sure they will be, what would your moral view on it be?"
1230,notsarc,"Well, if you breed them, you could get taller monkeys with less hair (and other humanlike characteristics). Even so, it would take a long time."

 I believe as you do, that having a child is not always the best and most responsible thing to do in certain circumstances. For what it is worth, I think you did the right thing, for you and your current children."
1233,notsarc,I don't agree with this debate. If preventing the Devil from interfering on earth should not be prevented by God then why is it that God did prevent the Devil from interfering in heaven after he was defeated? They are both essentially taking the Devil away from an area where he could potentially harm those that are good. God seemingly saw fit for one to occur but not the other. Why would that be?
1234,notsarc,"Actually the Apocrypha is made up of pre-Christian texts, and late 4th century is a bit of a stretch for the new testament, certainly all its component texts were widely accepted by the 2nd century. I don't whether it is ""generally accepted"" that the text was altered, it seems to me that you are projecting your own views based on the hypotheses of some scholars on to Biblical scholarship in general."
1235,notsarc,"So gay people, in your opinion, have no right to form the families of their choice? So you are defending the continued oppression of gay people?We are sick of conservative family types. We are tired of the closet. The phrase ""we are mad as hell and we are not going to take it any more"" applies. I see in your response the comming of the camps to lock and exterminate gay people. It is that type of thought, that jews were subhuman, that led to the final solution. As it is here with conservatives and religious right nuts, who believe gay people are sub human sickos in need of curing or killing."
1236,notsarc,"Actually, selection occurs by differential reproductive rates. What this means is that organisms which reproduce more will have more offspring than the others (obviously). Therefore, traits that help organisms reproduce will become more prevailant."
1237,notsarc,"I think you might want to check your logic here... As far as I am aware, drug addicts cause a great deal of crime to support their habit. As you are, I am not terribly fond of policing someone's personal habits, but when drugs are the motivating force behind burglaries, assaults and muggings and addicts carry diseases such AIDS and tuberculosis then means of curtailing this should be explored. This may include policing or controlling the supply of drugs to an area to cut down and the amount of drugs sold, and thus less crime to support fewer habits.Easy access to drugs is, logically, part of the problem."
1238,notsarc,And where exactly did you hear this? I find it hard to believe a governent that couldn't keep an affair or a low-level break-in under wraps could keep something like that secret................. Also if it is true and among alliance forces why do you blame solely the US?
1239,notsarc,What you quoted is what Answers in Genesis said. Please do not be dishonest and tell others that I said this as I did not.
1240,notsarc,"Not at all, more stories that have been fed to you. The notion of a literal Genesis was rejected two hundred years ago, when no evidence of it could be found. the leading scientists of the day were often also trained in divinity, so they were looking HARD for it. But they had the integrity to admit that it wasn't there."
1241,notsarc,"Intelligent design comes in many flavors too.ID that submits as a designer something that has any quality of the unknowable is irrational.ID that submits we were created/designed by things inside the universe that are knowable are rational claims. However, they have no evidence, so they have a long way to go to be shown to be worthwhile to pursue. Even a simple application of Occam's razor tells us that to suspect a thousand theories on how life has changed on earth is unecessary when another theory can fulfill the description entirely, of life, and they have evidence to support it. It's why this theory is discarded onto the heap of any number of theories that simply isn't going anywhere. You can make up a theory right now about how life began, but if it cannot be supported by evidence or is redundant to a theory already described...why would we?"

You should see some of the other ""books"" he has at his site as well.Well, now we know that Muslim creationists are even nuttier than Christian creationists, but both still use the same twisted ideas and concepts to justify their pseudo-science of creationism (Read: Religious beliefs). ;)"
1247,notsarc,"Here, the atheist satirists assign perfection to astronomers. They have no comprehension of God being above and beyond time, and this causes them to feel that theyre on the same level as God, able to question him and challenge him to the same extent he can question us and challenge us. Yet they know that there are characteristics of reality that they themselves cannot explain, though they probably seriously believe that astronomy is an exact, non-controversial science. "
1248,notsarc,"No, for murdering innocent babies in the womb by performing abortions that were not necessary but just being done as a means of birth control........."
1249,notsarc,Just because a clump if cell will develope into a live human being doesn't mean the mother is obligated to let it happen in her body whether she want it to or not. If that bothers you then STOP DWELLING ON IT.
1250,notsarc,"Actually, I had no intention of responding to WW. As I'm sure you can see by now, he doesn't actually respond to what's written, but rather just engages in lies and insults. He's not worth the effort to debunk; he's self-debunking."
1251,notsarc,"No, we shouldn't abolish every flawed system. However, when the flaw results in putting innocent people to death, it is not worth the risk.In 26 years the death penalty has been in effect in my home state of Illinois, there have been more people exonerated due to irrefutable evidence than have been put to death. I think that constitutes a serious problem."
1252,notsarc,"Because they couldn't own models like the AR-15 or AK-47? Last I checked those were banned in Chicago and much of Illinois, limiting people to mainly deer rifles."
1253,notsarc,"Well, there is a little more to it than that, but agreed."
1254,notsarc,"It's not just a kernel of uncertainty. Jews and Christians alike say that Moses wrote the Pentateuch, but a reading of the Pentateuch makes it obvious that this cannot be true. Luke did not write the book of Luke, the apostle Matthew did not write the book of Matthew, and we don't even claim to know the authors of many books of the Bible. Look up the Documentary hypothesis; early scholars shuffled ""holy writings"" together like a deck of cards to get the Old Testament that everybody today knows and loves."
1255,notsarc,"It would be 'an' analogy, but like the language analogy, it has its limitations.It is interesting to note that creationist computer software developers/programmers cannot seem to agree on the implications of 'mutations' when using such analogies - one such person, C.K. Lester, declared that computer programs can accumulate up to 30% 'random change', just like DNA (hypothetically) can, therefore, the computer analogy is a good one. But programmer R. David Pogge declares that even a single altered bit in a line of computer code a million bits in length would destroy it."
1256,notsarc,"Your question itself is a problem. God is 'He who is', not a 'what'."
1257,notsarc,"City council vote only, not sure about public sentiment, but from what I gather, most people don't care because they don't own guns. Whenever an issue like this comes up, people who are interested seem to become the loudest, both the pro- and anti-gun crowds."
1258,notsarc,"Working on it. Apparently we are still waiting for to to be graded (it was really big, at leat 20 typed pages). I plan on buying from them when they get it back, and maybe putting up a whole page in honor of it. Partly because I think it is very telling, partly because I remember what it was like to be in college and get a little recognition for your work."
1259,notsarc,"That's because its sophistry. Its an inherent contradiction and it simply means we don't have the capacity to understand it. Another more common example is that the assertion that the universe cannot be endless, and yet as far as we know it is. Trying to understand it is for us humans like an ant trying to fathom the theory of relativity.Damn are we ever conceited as a race...we seem to think that if we can't understand something, it cannot be. We also tend to think, in every generation, that we have achieved somehow the pinnacle of progress."
1260,notsarc,"A more precise term would be ""broaden,"" since nothing about the definition pertaining to the people currently covered by it would be affected, ""diluted"" or altered in any way anyone has yet demonstrated. Nothing about the definition that pertains to people who already are, or can be married changes one iota. Their rights, benefits, and protections remain exactly the same. The only ""change"" would be to other  people, people who have no connection to, nor impact on, the marriages of anyone else: the gays who'll marry if the legal definition is broadened to encompass them. And the only ""change"" in that regard will be the fact that they are  encompassed by it, nothing more. No substantive aspect of the definition as it currently stands changes in the slightest.The change is not in the definition itself. It's in who it applies to."
1261,notsarc,"But you know it is more then just that. The poster gave a specific date that is relevant to when abortion was legalized. It shows the poster is being selective and may hold prejudice to fetuses who arent aborted by legal abortions. You see, it is the pro-life movement's selective outrages that makes me think they aren't serious about abortion as a whole. "
1262,notsarc,"So for example if I say ""you are a part of my body, and therefore I have a right to kill you"", is this simply a matter of ideology?I admit the distinction is not clearcut at early stages of development, but how do you support the idea that post-birth children are ""a part"" of their mothers' bodies and therefore legitimate to kill?It is no more legitimate to say that a fetus is a part of a woman's body than it is to say that a woman is a part of a fetus' body. Just as a woman is not a subordinate slave to the fetus within her, the fetus cannot be considered subordinate in rights to the woman it is inside."
1263,notsarc,"Pregnancy is always harmful to the woman's body. However, if the pregnancy is desired then the changes are welcomed by the woman.To a woman who does not want to be pregnant then those changes are very unwelcome and are a bad thing. Pregnancy is always harmful, but the perception of what is happening changes depending on the woman.You do not understand that whether or not pregnancy harms the woman's body is objective, but whether or not the woman wants the pregnancy anyway depends on the woman. You are mixing the two."
1264,notsarc,I've been posting at least a few times a week. That's a lot more than once a month. I pointed out that the US has higher levels of gun crime than most developed nations while you tried to focus on a few tragedies in response to someone questioning the claim that criminals will always get guns. I think it's obvious whose argument is more cherry picked. 
1265,notsarc,No more so than the Scalia/Uncle Clarence Thomas cabal opining that the words NO LAW mean something other than what they do when they rule in a First Amendment case.
1266,notsarc,"Bellesiles claimed his data was destroyed in a flood. Lott claimed his data was destroyed in a computer crash. Some people have been calling John Lott ""the Bellesiles of the Right."" Read this article ""The Bellesiles of the Right? Another firearms scholar whose dog ate his data.""http://slate.msn.com/id/2078084/John Lott has already admitted to inventing a fan (Mary Rosh) to praise himself. That's intentionally trying to deceive people. http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp...&notFound=true"
1267,notsarc,"Theories change since they are just that - theories. Once time and sufficient investigation has given them sufficient weight, they become laws. Newton's laws were derived to explain direct human experiences (we deal with relatively large objects going at slow speeds relative to the speed of light) and for that regime, they remain true. Since there were still a multitude of basic unanswered questions at the time in Science (about light, the nature of matter, etc.), investigation continued and found, in the 20th century, the laws of relativity and quantum mechanics to explain occurrences outside of the range of the large and slow that we experience. At the beginning of science (say ~17th century), there were a lot more questions than answers. Now, its the other way around - at least when it comes to the essential theoretical basis behind things that human's experience."
1268,notsarc,I think more than this is the principle of human dignity. That humans have inherent dignity and value at every stage of life. This is transcendent of whether they are conscious or unconscious and it is why we treat 24 week premies who have no real conscious existence and a 30 year old automobile accident victim in a coma on a respirator and you and me the same. So strongly do humans recognize this inherent dignity that even in death a person is dignified with a funeral ceremony recognizing their life had inherent meaning and value. We build memorials to those who were victimized in life.
1269,notsarc,"Well, in the sense that we cannot actually detect the intelligent design Behe proposes, then it it OUTSIDE the limit of actual detection."
1270,notsarc,"I have a feeling that the tradtitional marriage the Dobson is refering to is only about 100 years old. Hardly traditional if you view it in the perspective of history. Up until the turn of the 20th century marriage was about property. The man physically owned the woman and the children. I sometimes laugh at these cithgaps, espically the women, when they talk about defending the traditional marriage. They are trying to defend a redefinition of something that has allready been redefined."
1271,notsarc,"What Is a Human Person and Who Counts as a Human Person?: A Crucial Question for Bioethics by Prof. William E. MayThere is also an extremely academic school of thought which views the human person in terms of the ego in all its derivations. I cannot hope to summarize what this is all about, please refer to:Philosophical Critiques: The Human Person - 3 One could also consider the social development of an infant, inasmuch as humans are, in most cases, very social animals.According to primatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, the human species is specifically developed to be part of a social system and a newborn infant comes ready made to push all the buttons of the system:"
1272,notsarc,"Well, your parents' parents also had parents who had parents who had parents which all streams back down to 2 people who God created...adam and eve. so ultimately your life is a gift from God because the whole human race was created by Him."
1273,notsarc,"I believe a man should be able to opt out of fatherhood.The problem with this article for me is the moral ambiguity - there is no consistent argument laid out for free choice, that is choice for women and men, or even one for consistent slavery (forced births from women, forced money from men). It reeks of the vindictiveness that can be seen in any number of fringe movements, of the ""I don't really care whether we live in a just society, as long as you're not treated better than me"".So yes, I ""a real pro-choicer"" agree with Matt here, the pro-choicers who are portrayed as disagreeing appear to be some kind of stereotyped 1970s feminist-socialist-activist-bra-burning type."
1274,notsarc,Because there are still a lot of people in this country that support oppression and injustice toward gay people.
1275,notsarc,"Aside from this being completly wrong, it is quite compelling. You make a good point in regard to an organism's form only making sense in relation to its environment. Of course, this is a cornerstone of evolutionary theory. Organisms that are more successful in a certain environment will reproduce and be the ones present in said environment. It actually is possible to look at genes without the context of the orginal creature. This is why we can move genes from one organism and place them in another. Given a complete understanding of molecular biology, we could contruct any form of organism we desired from scratch."
1276,notsarc,"Yes I do understand this. But you must admit that the instantaneous formation of a living organism, even an extremely primitive one, complete with the complexity of the DNA code as a result of random encounters of atoms and molecules is a little too much to buy. There is evidence right there for creationism. Only intelligence could have formed such an elaborate complex system for the structure of life and its propagation. "
1277,notsarc,"Actually, I've heard it all before and it is wrong. The article is full of misinformation and misrepresentation. It is, as you say, slanted rather than an honest report of the data."
1278,notsarc,"But I see two people involved here. Whether the women is better off or not is irrelevant to me. She has no right to kill the other just like you have no right to kill your neighbor. I'm not for allowing decisions on everything and to be against ""choices"" is not a bad thing considering every law restricts choices."
1279,notsarc,"So? In your religion's view, everyone sins. Their sin is no greater or more unforgiveable than yours."
1280,notsarc,But the number of criminals that have firearms can be reduced. In developed nations that have very strict gun laws there are a lot less criminals obtaining and using guns to commit crimes. How does your theory explain that?
1281,notsarc,"There's much more to it than that. There are several different kinds of genetic changes that are called mutations. Evolution is not limited to the effects of point mutations alone. Why don't you demonstrate your competence to discuss this topic by defining a point mutation, and then name and define several other kinds of mutation.And, of course, there are other mechanisms that increase the genetic variability in any population besides mutation. On the other hand, there are mechanisms that tend to reduce the variability in a population in addition to natural selection. Please name and explain at least 4 others in order that you do not continue to look like a fool."
1282,notsarc,"Then, how much money should spend on the war on terror? Should we bankrupt the country to do it? Is it necessary to spend so much that we go bankrupt, or is it better to wisely spend the money we have and to fight an intellegent war against terror?"
1283,notsarc,"Sure they matter. But that isn't the issue here. You posted this in the abortion forums as if this medical malpractice which is taking place in an impoverished third world country is justification for it in America. That is a ludicrous and totally bogus argument to make.If you thought rationally, you would have it in the health forum and be complaining about how third world countries are so ill prepared for this common problem when we have the technology so readily available to avoid it. My Lord simone, a simple C-Section is all that is required to make this a non issue for mother and baby. But you ignorantly post this drivel as if abortion is the solution. It makes no sense at all, and yet you post it thinking that you're contributing something rational. Go figure, huh!!! emoticonXFrazzled"
1284,notsarc,Actually all decisions based on the self ARE selfish decisions. I really don't care. I make them all the time too. Everyone does. While this is a philosophical issue I really see it as odd that people claim not to be selfish when doing something that benefits them or prevents harm to them with little regard to anyone else.
1285,notsarc,"Well of course everybody is entitled. But as history has shown many southern states in America chose to ignore the Constitution and deny black people their rights on the basis of their skin color, using the ""black codes"" enacted after the Civil War. If it weren't for the 14th Amendment that forced state governments to abide by the constitution, minorities would still be out in the cold.The only thing we've been over, is that government and gun control is racist, not the Second Amendment."
1286,notsarc,pro-choice is only pro child if the choice is not abortion and they are only pro family when the choice for family. So really pro choice can be pro child or anti child and pro family or anti family.
1287,notsarc,"This is ridiculous. Evolution is ""scientifically neutral"". It's you who has the bias."
1288,notsarc,"Ouch jyoshu...you are hitting them outta the park today.
 
 Exactly, it sounds nice but it certainly isn't the only moral rule and it certainly doesn't mean one follows it. I'd say selfishness is probably the underlying value in many cases."
1289,notsarc,"So now you're freely and willingly admitting that you'd take pleasure in inflicting pain and suffering on innocent people who have never done anything to you?
 
 Good God! No wonder you don't like guns and want to see everyone disarmed!"
1290,notsarc,"The only 'duty' that any human being has with a parasite is to extract it as quickly as they can, if they chose to do so."
1291,notsarc,Such personal attacks as yours indicate a bankruptcy of argument and reveal much about you while revealing nothing about me. If someone says that you are more likely to die in a car accident than in an airplane accident would accuse them of not caring about airplane accident victims? Would you accuse them of taking delight in the number of car deaths? 
1292,notsarc,"True, but I was referring to psychological explanations, not genuine reasons."
1293,notsarc,"No.I am saying. Privately owned guns serve the purpose of the militia, which is all citizens over 17 years of age.I am saying, a list of names and addresses do not serve any purpose of military readiness.My signature, yes it has no bearing on the Brady.org. I appologize for any confusion if anyone has interpreted as so. Your signature is about gun registration in a gun registration thread."
1294,notsarc,"This can only be plausible if the victims were killed before they reproduced.
 
 But, still evolutionary psychology is tenously at best called ""science.""
 Just as most of psychology IMO is barely science, if at all."
1295,notsarc,"Oh it's no mistake Montalban. I, unlike you, am quite clear in my arguments, and have a direction and a goal. We can take your other definitions of creationism one at a time, thank you very much. I'd like to first focus on the one that involves your god, or any god, described as being unknowable (which you have said your god is). Will you ""allow"" us to focus on ONE thing? You see, if we have a list of 4 things, and we go through them one by one, we can maybe arrive at the end!!! Crazy thought isn't it!"
1296,notsarc,"So do I, but my reasoning is highly speculative, even by my own standards."
1297,notsarc,"What has this got to do with the non-material world, of which God and you and I are a part of?I know that the Apostles witnessed God's miracles. I too am witness to God's miracles. The evidence is adequate for me and for much of the world's population... even many scientists (including evolutionists). You are in a loud minority, railing against the irrational hoards about you."
1298,notsarc,"Actually, I think that lack of support for your mythology is one of the reasons that it isn't accepted as literal. I suspect that your documentation is just assertion that you believe because it tells you what you want to hear.Why is it that creationists keep claining to have ""proof"" and never present any? Have you checked out the threads in the Religion forum where some posters are having trouble demonstrating the historicity of Jesus? How can you claim documentation for Adam & Eve, the Garden, talking snake, the flood?"
1299,notsarc,"Well, the claim isn't that they were identical, just that they preceded Jesus and were very similar."
1300,notsarc,"That's ridiculous. The purpose imposed by man is what makes it artificial in the first place. You have the idea expressed in the definition backwards. It isn't that natural selection operates on the same principles as artificial selection, but the reverse. The principles are that differential reproductive success will have an effect on the gene pool of the species."
1301,notsarc,"This obviously depends on the person. Both are not good...once again, a comparision is not gonna work. Whether you are an alcoholic or a weed-a-holic(not a real word) you will still mess up your health (which is a good reason we shouldn't have public health care)."
1302,notsarc,"I fail to see where I broke any of those rules, no names were called, there was no labeling, there was no none of it. And even if there was, you do it all the time, so what makes you any different. Practice what you preach Penfold."
1303,notsarc,Well I'm glad its no problem for your son. No child deserves to be harrassed.
1304,notsarc,"It is much more important that you concern yourself with the destiny of your soul, not how many years you can stay on the earth."
1305,notsarc,"Actually, submitting samples that will return bogus dates is dishonest. Creationists have done this several times."
1306,notsarc,"i'm impressed! this is a very precise description, in regular englishand yes, the deduction in 9 seems presumptious if all we state is God has a ""possibility of existence"". how this was cleverly cleared up (from the same source site) was simply a trip back to the definition: ""greatest possible being"". the ""greatest possible being"", by definition, MUST have a possible existence. in otherwords, we cannot assume that there is a possibility that the greatest possible being does not exist. yeah, it sounds like the whole ""proof"" is pointless because your premise is already the proofjust keep in mind that for the purposes of this proof, God is defined as ""the greatest being possible"". as long as that definition is maintained, the proof works...does that mean that God exists? hmmm....emoticonXFrazzled"
1307,notsarc,"This is different than stating that abortion is the same, in principle, as killing a born child. We are back on the question of ""Why would someone do this horrible thing"" which pro-life people continually ask and has been answered in many ways by many people. There are many threads on the subject :)That the fetus did not come into existance by it's own choice is really irrelevant. That it did not cause problems of it's own actions does not mean that it does not cause problems."
1308,notsarc,"The fact that they were too heavy, is simply untrue, see previous post. Hunting depends on many ecological factors, such as their predational preference. Also new fossils suggest a trees down development of bird flight so fully developed flight muscles and feathers were not necessary."
1309,notsarc,"and the pro-choicers claim pro-lifers appeal to emotion too much. Nevertheless, I think the embryos would probably be dead if they were just sitting on a counter somewhere so you then save the child."
1310,notsarc,I suppose the fact that Indian law only applies to its people. Who qualifies as an Indian is another matter. Many people who have as little as one-tenth Indian blood qualify for liberal hunting privileges here in Minnesota.
1311,notsarc,"Nearly all the food humans eat today, even in the Western world is GM including maize, tomatoes, and soy, etc, etc. used as ingredients in products such some soymilk. Essentially everything is with the exception of ""organic"". However, as i noted above, I wouldn't make this argument because I think GM soy esecially is not very healthy for people snd GM foods tend to be more prone to bacterial infection which can make people sick. I haven't read from all sides, however."
1312,notsarc,"Oh deary me, no. Where do I even start?The bacteria and enzymes in your gut and intestinal tract that digest food are every bit as microscopic, and they thrive on specific compounds, not elements. Sugars and fats are plain old carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. You could get exactly the same atoms into your body by drinking water and eating graphite - and you'd die. Can you digest cellulose? No - but other animals can, because they have enzymes that can break it down. It's still all just carbon, oxygen and hydrogen - but that's like saying everybody's front door key is just 'brass'. It isn't the fact that it's brass that unlocks your door, it's the shape it's formed into :)"
1313,notsarc,What this highlights is that the laws of the land are ignored and some people try to place the blame on the victims.
1314,notsarc,"A being is something that is conceivable as existing...or something that actually exists.A human being is one of us, a homo-sapien, a member of the group of beings known as animals.A rock is a being of inanimate qualities.God is the supreme being, not capable of being understood totally as this would put Him (or It, or She) on the same level as those that He created.We will never be able to define exactly what or who God is!God is great.God is good.Let us thank Him for our food.God is my shepherd.God is my Light.God is my Co-pilot.God is what keeps me from believing that all this (the totality of all things and happenings) came about by accident.When God made man, She was only kidding! ;)"
1315,notsarc,"Actually, penguins are birds. Therefore, they don't have fur, but feathers.
 
 However, your point still holds."
1316,notsarc,Could it be that the Supreme Court does not view the right protected by the Second Amendment as being fundamental? This is the same court that said that only guns in common use are protected by the Second Amendment. That tells me the Supreme Court doesn't think the right to bear arms is as fundamental as other rights protected by the Bill of Rights. The protection of a newspaper by freedom of the press does not depend on the newspaper being in common use.
1317,notsarc,"He's pointing out that the situation is about the mother and the baby, and that the baby's right to life ends exactly where the woman's right to personal autonomy begins. That's the interesting thing about rights-based ethics, that the rights of any individual are limited precisely by the rights of all other individuals."
1318,notsarc,"Well, ""reasonable"" is clearly subjective... So the authors of the letter are practicly saying that any gun laws not interfering with the state militia would be permited according to the second amendment. But that gun laws obviously should be reasonable. But what reasonable is, is best left to the democratic will of the people. Or am I reading it wrong?"
1319,notsarc,"Well you don't need to doubt it. I like to be rational but I also wish to believe in God. I need some evidence, any evidence, to believe in God and that would be all I would need."
1320,notsarc,"This is why people shouldn't have opinions, rather facts. Opinions should remain neutral untill sufficient objective evidence can be gathered. When people run off having ""opinions,"" they cause trouble.The fact that someone doesn't do or believe what he is selling doesn't affect the validity of the argument. There are teachers who don't believe in evolution, yet they teach it because it's standardized.You have people who promote an idea because it's popular, because of convention, or because someone tells them to.Someone can be saying something, believing something else, yet be totally wrong. THeir belief isn't the fact."
1321,notsarc,"I believe that's true, and as a ""believer"" (creationist), here is what is hard to understand about that; In Matthew, 12:30, Jesus says ""He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters"". It is safe to say that both creationists and theistic evolutionists would accept that statement from Jesus, and would seek to be ""with"" him, while agnostic and atheists would consider themselves ""not with"" him. Yet theistic evolutionists are comfortable to (usually politically) be ""with"" agnostics and atheists, and separate themselves from creationists. If they're genuine Christians, knowing about the warnings in the Bible about false teachings, how can they be comfortable with that?Miller laments in several places throughout the book that atheists use evolution as a weapon against religion, and that it shouldn't be that way - that it causes more strife between the two than should exist. "
1322,notsarc,"The observable universe represents an event horizon, outside of which we cannot see. The actual extent of the universe beyond that is at present unknowable. Current versions of M-theory hold that our universe was formed from the collisions of branes in a higher dimension."
1323,notsarc,"deliberate acts of fabrication to produce false and fradulent claims as to what others have said. You cited my posts which did not imply anything of the sort you claimed it did and what I thought. In fact, some of the cited refute such claims."
1324,notsarc,"Just common sense. If a mutation provides some benefit, it tends to be retained. Over time, (sometimes over a very short time) this can produce a new structure as we see in this case."
1325,notsarc,"No. That's not what I said. I said that natural selection is differential reproductive success. I said that those organisms that possessed advantageous characteristics would tend to reach reproductive age more frequently and therefore they will tend to produce more offspring, while those with disadvantageous characteristics will tend to produce fewer offspring. As a result, the heritable characteristics of the population will change over time."
1326,notsarc,I think an open mind is the best thing to have when it comes to theories. I think there is some truth in everything.
1327,notsarc,This is correct. It is almost insulting to regard people as either a) Christian OR Catholic - as this also implies that Orthodox are neither
1328,notsarc,"The counter arguments put forth by its critics do not defeat the Violinist arguments, at the very least. Whether one accepts the argument anyway is another story :P"
1329,notsarc,"Yes you do. I've already posted your words saying you believe it exists. Deal with that first. I note now you have a habit of just ploughing on ahead when faced with evidence.
 How do you know nothing about the unknowable?"
1330,notsarc,"People are protected by law from being harassed, assaulted and/or murdered because they are people. Not because they are a certain religion. Because they are people it would be wrong to allow such things."
1331,notsarc,"Yes, because congresses powers are actually pretty limited. It hink it will be interesting to see how the 2 upcoming supreme court cases (one has already been accepted, the other is pretty much a shoe in) regarding the commerce clause will be handled, since the majority of the laws that congress passes are tied to it. "
1332,notsarc,"Pretty close to what we are doing.It is going to be outdoors, in my boss's backyard (nice area). It will be small, family, friends, 40 people tops. We will have some kind of food, haven't figured that yet. Got a really small budget. We plan on the vows, and rings and our parents doing something.Lucky for us, we have great friends who want to plan it for us. But some details I feel we should decide."
1333,notsarc,"Without the Fall, Jesus would have no need to come to earth and be resurrected. Without Genesis, the entire bible-as-literal kinda falls apart."
1334,notsarc,"Yep. Here in the U.S., the 5.7 ammo is the ordinary hollow point for Civilian use. It does not penetrate. It is not Armor Piercing."
1335,notsarc,"Excuse me, but you didn't fully read what he wrote. He didn't say that he supported abortion. He said that he wasn't as much a freak about it as you're being."
1336,notsarc,"The big bang, life from non-life, the progression of life from the simple to the complex, just to name a few. None of these can be proved (even on the balance of probabilities) to be true by operations science. All of these contradict scientific observations of the present. As a result, you must take them by purely blind faith."
1337,notsarc,"just how i said it...
 opinion... 
 like, what you think
 of it"
1338,notsarc,But you know that this is not what I was saying: We have a basis for comparison.
1339,notsarc,"So please, feel free to leave this thread to those who DO wish to discuss the issue. No one is forcing you to discuss the topic of this or any other thread. I notice you evidently are not interested in ""Understanding ""Sexual Prejudice"""" That is absolutely fine with me.Or are you now opposed to ""Freedom of Speech"" also?"
1340,notsarc,"Well, many argue that pro gay rights is a conservative. They say that conservatives favor government staying out of people's lives and not dictating the way that people should live. They argue that conservative people are using religion, not conservative principle to stand against gay rights. I don't know if that is true; I do know that whether conservative, liberal, both, or neither, I cannot find a way to call myself a good person if I do not support gay rights."
1341,notsarc,"Well if you're going to quote that article that mentions Canada to support your opinion, then does that mean you're in favor of gun registration and licensing? Canada has them. And if the NRA is really interested in enforcing laws why do they ask congress to reduce the budget of law enforcement? The NRA uses its political muscle to make it easier for criminals to obtain guns. Robert Ricker, former top lawyer of the NRA, talks about it. "
1342,notsarc,"Yes, but the statement directly contradicts proponents of ""creation science"" and of ID. Their claim is that they are doing science, even though they can't show how. Scientists have claimed all along that creationists/IDers are doing philosophy and religion, but not science. That is the problem. They never offer any evidence that supports their assertions, only mythology and superstition.But now we have Ray admitting that creationism and ID are not science and can't be included in science. They either philosophy or theology, but not science."
1343,notsarc,Well do you mean Texas or Texans? Because Texas holds the record for execusions in the US. Not something I'd be proud of.
1344,notsarc,"This was a comment on the physics book that has biographies of great physicists that were Bible believing christians. Right. Many believed in alchemy (they were wrong), harmful effects of night air (they were wrong), spontaneous growth of maggots from rotting meat (they were wrong), rats arising from grain (they were wrong), and the Bible (they were wrong). If it is important that Newton believed in the Bible, why isn't it as important that he believed in alchemy and did not believe in the divinity of Christ.There isn't any such thing as science from a Christian perspective. Either it is science, or it isn't.You claimed to have studied evolution. You didn't. Why would you tell us that you did?"
1345,notsarc,"Not all evolution takes place over billions of years. There has been speciation that we have actually seen occuring within a few years at a time. ""bacteria, birds etcs.""Natural selection occures frequently. You can ""observe"" evolution through the fossile record, DNA, morphology etcs.Evolution has made predictions, these predictions have come true, ergo, it's good."
1346,notsarc,"You not differentiating between the beaver and the beaver dam, the bird and the bird's nest or the man and the man's truck. The dams, nests and truck do not occur naturally...they are constructed by the naturally occuring animals using materials that occur in nature (albeit we have to smelt the iron and vulcanize the rubber whilst the birds and beavers just stick stuff together)."
1347,notsarc,"Yep - that's someting that many ""pro-lifers"" also never take into account."
1348,notsarc,"That's NOT the equivalent of ID - you're mixing causes & effects. The theory of evolution, and the theory of intelligent design would equally observe, measure, and publish the effects of the apple falling. Then the evolutionists would say that happenstance origins caused gravity to work that way, and ID proponents would say that a supernatural design caused gravity to work that way. Students shouldn't have it implied to them that happenstance origins are the only possible cause of gravitational behavior. Your ""apple falling"" scenario is a simple one - the original cause of gravity has practically no impact on how we observe and deal with it's effects. Other scientific subjects aren't that simple. "
1349,notsarc,"Well, creationists claim he said that. However, there is no real evidence he ever did. They give two sources.. one says it is was in the 100th edition of the 'origin of species), and the other one was on the centinial edition (which is a real trick, since that is 4 years after his death). No one seems to be able to find the primary source for that quote. Imagine that."
1350,notsarc,Where has it been shown? How is it used to make predictions about species chances of survival for the future?
1351,notsarc,"I think the Obama administration has been working with Republicans, and much too much. That's why the bill is what it is.
 
 Although I think it was Feingold who said that Obama has gotten the bill he intended to, from the beginning."
1352,notsarc,"Well some call me liberal (VoR anyone?) and I am definately pro-choice, I'll chime in here. I completely agree that in Roe v. Wade they made the wrong decision. I think ammendment X comes into play here. Nowhere in the Constitution does it allow for the federal government to make restrictions based on abortion. This should be up to the states. Now on that same note it is also unconstitutional for the federal government to make a law banning abortion. This is a law that should be addressed by the states as it is not resered to the federal government."
1353,notsarc,So what are some examples of restrictive gun laws in South Africa? The people in South Africa think their gun laws are not strict enough. In one of your previous posts you seem determined to use South Africa as evidence that outlawing guns doesn't work. But gun ownership is still legal there.
1354,notsarc,"Well to get healthcare from $6000 per person to $3,400 per person you'd have to pay them less or fire them. So do I understand you correctly that we will either cut pay or fire doctors and nurses?EDIT: that seems dramatic...not ""fire"" them but they will basically go into another profession since they are no longer needed."
1355,notsarc,And that has happened in some cases. Mosquitoes are changing the development cycles to coincide with increasingly warmer temperatures. Fish species are enlarging their habitats as water temperatures rise. Many species are moving north as temperature rises
1356,notsarc,"Of course everyone has some basis for their views. Not even denying that. However there are ways that using that ""basis"" most certainly is an imposition and the gay rights battle is a prime example. There are many, many, many people who have done work to stop/block gay marriage and other gay rights when they, themselves, are not gay. That is not merely passing judgement - that is imposition. All I am asking here is that Archie, you, JP, etc. own that."
1357,notsarc,"There's absolutely no way in hell this could be legal in any sense. That California school got ***** slapped for expelling a student who had a gun off campus, beyond the jurisdictional reach of the school. So how can this school believe they can get away with such an insane policy?"
1358,notsarc,"But still, if you think there are rights in the bill of rights that is wrong, that should not be granted or guaranteed, it would be a viable option to vote for removing them.What debate are you trying to end here? The debate: 'do you want little or less gun-control'?"
1359,notsarc,"Actually the Bible has changed, not to mention had omissions."
1360,notsarc,"Maybe sentient would have been a better word to use.
 
 In a nutshell my position is it is no more immoral to kill a baby before it becomes sentient (if there are good reasons to do so) then it is to euthanatize a dog at the dog pound."
1361,notsarc,"Are you saying that without emotional investment in not believing in evolution, evolution makes sense?"
1362,notsarc,"In the split second something happens, we must protect ourselves."
1363,notsarc,"And how have I deprived you of your right to teach your religion to your children in your home and in your church. How does an objection against the imposition of your religion by force of the government deprive you of your rights. I can certainly see how the imposition of your religion would deprive me of my right to the free exercise of my own religion, but why do you feel that you have a right to impose your religion on me?"
1364,notsarc,"tortured? you shut ur mouth..,... if ur not achristian then yes, i will pray for you...."
1365,notsarc,"And I just say that it would be unjust and unfair of you to force metaphysical belief systems of your own which constitute religious belief upon your follows who may believe otherwise than you. Get pregnant and treat your fetus as a full person if you wish, nobody will force you to abort it. Let others follow their own beliefs differing or the same. Otherwise you attempt to obtain justice by doing injustice.Mo"
1366,notsarc,Well you've made a good point; just because something is banned or made illegal doesn't mean that it'll have an affect on reducing the numbers.
1367,notsarc,"You can have reasoned faith, but it need not rely on 'empirical' evidence. There are very many forms of evidence."
1368,notsarc,"Actually, the fossil record does support it. Both Eldredge and Gould have discussed it. Both men made observations of slow gradual speciation in the fossil record in a small geographical area. These changes were reflected at other locations as an abrupt change from one species to another. But given that such changes take place very quickly in populations that are usually under environmental stress and isolated from the main population, and given the rarity of fossilization in the first place, we don't expect to find many examples in the fossil record. It is a bit like trying to time a 100 yd. dash with a sundial. The fossil record just isn't fine grained enough to see the rapid (50-60 thousand years) changes."
1369,notsarc,"But not just any seven judges, seven judges who's job is to define the constitution."
1370,notsarc,"And for years they did. They still can. Again, there is not a real problem with pirates."
1371,notsarc,"But it did have (if we are talking the very first non-unicellular organisms) tiny ickle wickle bits and pieces that eventually became what we call 'organs'. Seriously, if you can't answer my questions above then you have no business questioning the theory, because if you don't know what the theory says, how can you argue against it? Your questions in this thread make no sense because they do not even address the issues from the standpoint of what is already known."
1372,notsarc,"So a free society is one where the goverment does not have tabs on their citizens? How could then the goverment work when it does not know who they actually govern? The foundation of economics is that you have correct data, else its the beginning of corruption not freedom. And since when was there a dichotomy between freedom and socialism? Further how does the usage of identification ease the rounding up of suspects? Wouldnt it be rather MORE risk to be rounded up if you couldnt identify yourself and thus automatically become suspect than be able to and take yourself out of the calculation?"
1373,notsarc,"So you're admitting that Sarah Brady intentionally committed a straw purchase of a firearm, especially one that can be modified and turned into a long range sniper rifle."
1374,notsarc,"No one mentioned helping or not helping people here, or even dealing with the consquences of pregnancy at all. Its more;'If abortion were banned, what measures or research would you suggest to reduce the pressure for people to have illegal ones or unwanted pregnancies'."
1375,notsarc,OH get off it!!!! How many times have we seen the argument from your side that gay marriage would increase the incidence of AIDS?
1376,notsarc,"But you need proof to back up a explantion. If you didn't, all you'd have a creationism. Explanations without any support."
1377,notsarc,"jessica, all these problems you've listed, the human body takes care of automatically and remarkably well. the fact still remains that only less than 5% of all abortions occur because the risk is great enough to be deemed life-threatening to either tha mother or the child. and that percentage is diminishing as well. the overwhelming majority of abortions occur simply because the woman decides she does not wnat to be a mother."
1378,notsarc,actually they probably drifted much faster than that.....probably upon a pole reversal.
1379,notsarc,Manslaughter involves a direct action that causes an unintentional death. Miscarriage is involuntary; besides the person suffering a miscarriage might well want to keep the baby. To equate miscarriage with manslaughter is preposterous.
1380,notsarc,"Most people are not pro-abortion, they are pro-choice. No one here is going around demanding that women must have abortions."
1381,notsarc,Sounds pretty neat. I've never been there but I'll keep it in mind for a road trip some time.So you are of the belief that dinosaurs and man lived at the same time? I know that there are people who believe in this but I don't come across them very often. So what information do you have to share with us about this idea?
1382,notsarc,"You know that, I know that, but the creationists do not know that."
1383,notsarc,"Yes, there are differences, but the claim is not that the other stories were identical, just that they preceded the time Jesus is claimed to have lived, and that elements of these various foreshadowing stories were very similar to those told about Jesus.Continuing for a second on the idea of the eucharist having been borrowed by Christians from earlier traditions:"
1384,notsarc,Whether a fetus is a person is not something open to consideration. An apple is not an orange. The reason that we have two words to apply as labels is simply because they absolutely are not the same thing. It is that simple.Suppose that a fetus is frozen and implanted in a female 22 years later. Is it of legal drinking age at birth? Obviously not. We currently have the technology to actually do this.
1385,notsarc,"How is that conclusion derived at? The passage is speaking to the consequences to a man who's actions cause the death of an unborn child. And the proscribed consequence is death according to OT Law. So although the passage isn't speaking to abortion at all, it is making a very clear statement regarding the value of the unborn, as it is requiring a life for a life just as for any other sentient being according to the OT Law. So these arguments I get from the likes of you and Iangb which argue that until a child shows mental awareness, it isn't actually a person deserving of human rights is a bogus and shortsighted position according to the scriptural point of view. Of that, there is no question."
1386,notsarc,"Throw off our conclusions about what? I'm getting a bit confused as to what you're trying to cast doubt upon.Dark matter is stuff that doesn't interact via the electromagnetic force, so again by definition anything that we can't 'see' using EM waves is dark matter. this is an interesting article about one way we can observe it indirectly"
1387,notsarc,"That is just conservative bias. Conservatives are just as guilty of the same things as liberals and then each has their own ideological idiocy that is unique to each group. Conservatives like classes and don't like change. A pure conservative society would fail just as quickly as a pure liberal one. The last 10 - 20 years as we have become more us vs. them the overall prosperity and well being of the country has declined. With both sides taking the country to extremes. Conservatives eased restrictions and corporations run wild. Those laws are in place for a reason. Liberals overreact and put a choke hold on growth. There was a reason for less restrictive laws, but now they can't do anything meaningful."
1388,notsarc,For once I agree with you. Your wrong on your thoughts and views with evolution but your right in saying that abortion is wrong.
1389,notsarc,"So what you are saying is simply that the genes do not actively control the body.What is wrong with assuming that genes therefore do not control the body is the fact that the genes were the blueprint for the body. The genes decided the arrangement of cells, the number of fingers, etc.The body, the cells, and the organelles within the cells are therefore strongly influenced by the DNA sequence."
1390,notsarc,"Because violent crime and violent criminals is something that I can't control. Heart disease, that can be worked on with good diet, exercise and medicine if necessary. It's manageable, controllable and can be avoided. You can't do that with a violent criminal."
1391,notsarc,"Well, HRC estimates that the costs would be negligable and that some governments would actually save money. They site many studies on the issue, which I have not taken the time to look up, as I think this sort of statistic is worthless. It is unreasonable to ask same-sex couples to pay for the marriage of opposite-sex couples without asking opposite-sex couples to return this payment. Still, you seem very concerned about it, so I will provide this link:http://www.hrc.org/Template.cfm?Sect...entDisplay.cfmIt is an interest group in favor of gay rights, yes, but that doesn't make them wrong. I did have a link to an actual study on the topic, but I cannot seem to find it. I'm sure if I scoured the Internet more, I could come up with something."
1392,notsarc,"No, there isn't a consensus among Christians, at least not beyond the fact that God was responsible in one way or another for the universe existing. There is no consensus about method."
1393,notsarc,All of these examples are scientifically recognized as human life with a unique genetic code.
1394,notsarc,"And some of those tests fail. There are holes in the theory of gravity. Yet gravity remains fact in simple every day terms. Evolution is fact because ""we can observe it's effects on objects and we can do tests to determine more about it"". Further there are very few holes in that theory. Evolution is therefore more deserving of being called fact than gravity is. What I think you are really trying to say is that you can think you understand gravity (drop ball; ball falls) therefore you see it as a fact. But evolution is complex even at a basic level, so you do not see it as fact."
1395,notsarc,"I wish you guys would quit trying to ""muddy the waters"" by introducing facts that contradict my claims, innuendo, cliches and WAG. - signed X gazer"
1396,notsarc,"Sounds like the same skeptic argument above. I don't know about you Nu Leader, but when I'm certain my mind exists. Are you not certain? You are actually required to be, to deny you exist would require existence, and that would be logically contradictory."
1397,notsarc,"Please go to 
 http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/
 and do research. You will find some hard to understand articles and some easy ones. All of them, however, are very informative."
1398,notsarc,Apparently you thought I was claiming that pro-lifers thought that the baby's life was more valuable than the mother's life. So I clarified:
1399,notsarc,"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/hosb703.pdf
 It doesn't look like the UK has been doing too bad. Crime has actually been decreasing."
1400,notsarc,"Ok. I'm not a YEC. So, God creation through science is a viable option for my faith."
1401,notsarc,"Well let me put it like this, I consider it your duty because if you don't protect yourself then you basically shift that responsibility to someone else. Not only is this incredibly selfish, but 9 out of 10 times the 'protection business' gets outsourced to the State.This in itself it dangerous because when people decide that a third party like the State (which has no real accountability) has control over their lives it can all to easily lead to a situation where the State becomes tyrannical.More people have been killed by their own government than by any foreign government."
1402,notsarc,So you put words in Machs mouth. This would be acceptable if you were not doing it in a malicious fashion to get some sort of sadistic pleasure but you were instead actually trying to get him to explain himself. At any rate it totally disproves your nonsense about how you above me because you do not put words into peoples mouths because you do the same. You were not being dishonest to start with I admit it would be wrong to deliberately misrepesent you but neither of the circumstances apply here.
1403,notsarc,"Stuff I picked up in Uni, along with the Human genetic code being 40% identical to a banana... so no specific reference, sorry."
1404,notsarc,"And compare that to an equivalent sized human - if you compared the skill to a 10-13 year old boy, the erectus skeleton's cranial capacity would be significantly smaller. Doesn't contradict in the slightest other than the bizarre positions you decide other people should hold."
1405,notsarc,"732,000 DIDN'T sign the petition. It seems only 5% of South Dakotans say ""repeal the extreme abortion ban"" and that is ASSUMING that all the signatures are valid. The good news for South Dakota is that come November they can show America how they really feel about abortion as opposed to having the courts decide laws."
1406,notsarc,"If one can't attempt to falsify a theory then it is not open to science and therfore useless to science.
 
 It becomes simply an untestable belief."
1407,notsarc,"See the above critique. Of course, this also is underestimating the power of natural selection and random varition, and includes the logical fallacy of personal incredibiltiy."
1408,notsarc,"Yes, do you? It's in a country with no medical facilities, no sterile place to get it done. A country full of HIV and AIDS. I wouldn't be surprised if these mothers had HIV/AIDS and knew they'd leave their child an orphan."
1409,notsarc,"I'm sure you reproduce these quotes in good faith, but you ought to know they are not necessarily what they seem. The Darwin quote is a particularly craven quote mine: he was expressing empathy with those of his readers who found it difficult to imagine how such a thing as an eye could evolve by stages; effectively putting himself in their place so that he might more readily take them by the hand and show them how such evolution may occur, with ample supporting evidence from the natural world. I refer you to the Quote Mine Project for further edification."
1410,notsarc,"Creationism is not something new, it was the prevailing view of scientists up until Darwin. None of them belived in a divine parrot that is just plain silly. In the crucible of natural science throughout the Middle Ages, the Scientific Revolution and well into the 19th century theology was the queen of the sciences. Now we subject students to higher math studies that they will most likely never use and speculations about conceptual mechanisms like natural selection that have no practical application. Naturalistic presumption has become sacrosanct in the rhetoric of the professional scientists who have been crystal clear on how they define creationism. You can ignore the statement by D.J.Futuyma and identical ones made by Gould, Mayr, Dawkins, Dobzhansky and others but not without departing from mainstream evolutionary biology. "
1411,notsarc,That's a pretty tortured comparison :) What exactly makes the forecaster's error one of measuring distance?
1412,notsarc,It's not just cars and catalytic converters have greatly decreased emissions.
1413,notsarc,"If information came into being by chance, how can we know that anything is true? How do you know what is false and what is ""true""? If we are just products of chance, your brain is also a product of chance. Therefore, the thought patters that determine your logic are also products of chance. If your logic is the result of chance processes, you can't even be sure it evolved properly. You can't even be sure you can reason properly (using your definition) because you can't trust your own logic.As for the second part, no, you've got it backward, rational belief is based on faith in a rational creator.

No, of course not. Many other things there said to be 'true' are only 'true' in a transient sense of the word (that only science seems to use)http://www.clarku.edu/~piltdown/map_...klywiener.html Suggests that Piltdown Man had good science behind it, at the time.Never-the-less the Natural History Museum provides many examples of artistic licence, such as the 'human-like' hand given to a restoration of Australopithecus, displayed at the museum.""Shattering the Myths of Darwinism"", p205"

1422,notsarc,"One reason for conversion is that they do practice many religions. Jesus said He is the only way to God. I believe that, so how can I just turn a blind eye when people follow so many different religions? I would not be following the commands of my Lord."
1423,notsarc,"As much as it pains me I'm going to agree with Mathew here. If you own a private business then you should be able to hire and fire people for whatever reason you want. If a private company only wants to employ one gender that should be their choice. If a private company only wanted to employ people choosing a gay lifestyle, I would support their right to do so. I also support a persons right to not use businesses who have hiring practices they don't agree with.Note: I don't include gov't in this, the rules are and should be different for government."
1424,notsarc,To be honest i think that the risks are equal they are no higher in childbirth than they are in termination there are no qaurentees in either.
1425,notsarc,"Which, to my mind, is the more proper way to do things. Having the people decide on legislative matters seems alot like having a commitee of your neighbors decide on the proper way to perform your heart surgery. Too many states make it far too easy to get an issue on the ballot, and alot of very stupid laws and constituional amendments have resulted. Take a look at California politics if you want some examples."
1426,notsarc,It hasn't been proven that the Second Amendment is solely about tyrannical governments and not about dealing with violent criminals.
1427,notsarc,"And as I said, Herbert Spencer's ideas predate Darwin's. Meanwhile, Dawkins writings on religion are irrelevant to whether evolution is good biology."
1428,notsarc,"And what is an inheritance? Proverbs 13:13 he who feareth the commandment shall be rewarded. 14 The law of the wise is a fountain of life. 15 Good understanding giveth favor 16 Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge 17 a faithful ambassador is health 18 but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured. 19 The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul 20 He that walketh with wise men shall be wise 21 but to the righteous good shall be paid. What inheritance should a good man leave to his children's children? Solomon wasn't talking of money, but of God's law. In Solomon's view, the wicked can have their money, the true reward goes to the righteous. Why this should contrast with selling your luxuries and giving to the poor I'm not sure. "
1429,notsarc,"What do you mean by this? Could we not have the law treat under-18 capital offenders on an individual basis, determining whether the individual offenders in the individual cases were sufficiently developed?Also, what would you say to the response that our current law provides that juveniles are sufficiently developed enough to have the responsibility, without parental involvement, to decide whether to obtain an abortion? Is it not a conflict to say juveniles should not be eligible for the death penalty because they are not morally developed enough, but at the same time say juveniles are morally developed enough to decide whether to obtain an abortion without involving their parents?"

1434,notsarc,"So religion must be systematically abandoned and eradicated, not completely, just enough to be out of the public and political realm, leaving atheism as king. It's not my pet theory that evolutionists are saying that, it's a fact that they are saying that"
1435,notsarc,"This is obviously incorrect since Earth and Mars are were created only 6,000 years ago. And how did they know that Mars would be so close this year?I have other questions too. How do they know that Pluto has a 249 year orbit of the sun since it wasn't discovered until 1930. No one has seen it orbit the sun yet. How did they know that it would actually come closer to the sun than Neptune in 1979 and move forther away again in 1999? They told me that when I was young. But no one had ever seen it. It was just speculation - a scientific theory, right?? ;) :p"
1436,notsarc,"So given that there are cases where both dies... we just have to give up the mother's right to live over a fetus (which will die)? What if the mother isn't physically ready to have a baby. In the case of a young female (I'm talking age of 9 and younger, cause there are cases of young kids having their periods) being raped, doesn't she a ""baby"" (and I say baby, because she is still at an age where a parent would consider her their youngin)... have the right to live? For me, if I knew my child was raped and is in no way ready for a child of her own, physically or mentally... I would rather her not risk her life to try and bring that fetus into the world.Abortion should be pro-choice."
1437,notsarc,"Actually, the only people who I hear talk about ""sub-human"" are creationists.

1439,notsarc,"Actually, I'm not looking for shootouts at all with the criminal element. But what is crazy in my opinion, is admitting that there are holes in the system that allow criminals to get automatic weapons illegally, and you see the solution as banning automatic weapons from being purchased by law abiding citizens rather than screaming for the holes in the system to be fixed so the criminals can't get them. It seems to me that you have an anti-gun agenda and will use any flaw in the system as an excuse to ban all guns for all people. Is that a fair assessment of where you stand?"

1442,notsarc,Really? Have you ever heard of population genetics? Do you know what Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is?

I dont trust guns to only be used in 'selfdefense'.I want my government to uphold justice and to protect me from criminals. Thats one of their purposes. And that is impossible without a certain amount of control over the citizens.""This is liberal.. you believe governments are smarter than people.

Also, I worked with emotionally unstable children aged 3 and older, and observed what a delightful species the three-year-olds are. At that point, infants have progressed from the largely self-involved awareness of the 24-month infant as the developing human deals with the problem of separateness and, as a result, issues a robust declaration of independence.

The result was a litter of hybrid offspring. It seems that polar bears and brown bears are perfectly interfertile. Not only that, it has been shown that the offspring are also interfertile with either species. DNA analysis has been able to distinguish brown bears from polar bears except in the case of the brown bears of the ABC islands. They are indistinguishable from polar bears.And yet, even if a brown bear where white or a polar bear were brown, they are so obviously different in morphology that they would be classified as separate species. The differences go far beyond color."
1461,notsarc,"Depends on the usage. Generally, it just refers to the Theory of Evolution or a change in allele frequencies in a population."
1462,notsarc,The article is saying that it was genetic changes. Changes in genes encoding certain transcription factors is what caused changes in the expression of other genes.
1463,notsarc,NO I mean every word of what I type. If they institute these rules I will back off gay claim to marriage and accept that marriage is about children.As long as they continue to let 70 and 80 year olds get married marriage is not about children and there is no reason to exclude gay people.I would also add one more lisencing rule8 No one may have children with out a marriage lisence.

I DO know that this had nothing to do with the British refusal to conscript indians into the British Army. This was directed at the disarming of the Indian Army under british rule. The indian citizens were never actually disarmed under British rule, just the army. During WWI, indians were allowed to volunteer for the British army (the British knew it was a bad idea to conscript men from colonies)."

And if not, (the more important question) how would they determine what constitutes civil rights. (Which you didn't answer, but rather basically said 'I don't know but rest assured they do' (to paraphrase). Get it now?

1487,notsarc,"I believe the Bible is correct in every detail. The difference is how those who read them choose to interpret their meaning. You, for instance, look at a verse that says the earth cannot be moved and take that to mean that the Bible says that the earth does not move PERIOD. I believe that that means that God is powerful enough to keep the earth from simply ""flying out"" of its orbit and rocketing off into space somewhere. Yes, I proudly ""cling"" to the idea that a flood covered the mountains. I believe fully in the ENTIRE Bible (unlike some people) and I DO NOT ""pick and choose"" what I believe."

It's not just that PZ and Dawkins object to the content of the movie -- the makers of Expelled don't want them to be able to object in the first place.

However them simply stating this, is no different than Obama making a statement on national news, and then several months later saying ""I never said that"" and trying to reverse his position.Until it can be proven beyond doubt as being untrue and simple propaganda, the memo is real and explains in detail exactly what the gun control groups are after."
1497,notsarc,"That is exactly what I am saying. By no means do I condone big government saving the economy by any means, defense spending or anything resembling a modern New Deal.What may suprise you here is that I am afraid of people with guns!

It is a large credit to our professional officer corps that we don't have a miitary coup every few years.I just wish the rest of our government had the same discipline.

Before I get flamed, I am not advocating a military junta as form of government for the United States."

A round square, a colorless green idea that sleeps furiously, you name it."

But this has nothing to do with scientific truth.There is no ""version"" of science that one chooses from a menu of possibilities.By definition, scientific enquiry arrives at hypotheses after gathering evidence from observations and experiment. Any law, knowledge, etc. thatis arrived at by scientific method is open to modification or falsification if new evidence comes to light that must be taken into account. All science in this sense is provisional.The apostles may have believed that Jesus walked on water: that does NOTmake it true."

1550,notsarc,"As others pointed out, this is a misconception. I have little doubt that the great majority of pro-choice people are quite positive about wanted pregnancies. I suspect that this misconseption comes from the fact that almost all abortion discussions are about pregnancies that are not wanted. Pregnancies that are wanted are almost never discussed since they are not relevant to an abortion debate. After all, who would want to abort a fetus if they wanted to be pregnant and have a baby (excluding rare cases of risk of mother's death, severely deformed fetus, etc.)?"
1551,notsarc,"Those abortions that are perpetrated as ""birth control"" should be outlawed."
1552,notsarc,"Amen mekayla, and welcome to the forum. Now prepare for the ensuing hate speech which is sure to come from the pro death and infanticide advocates who are sure to attack you for daring to share your common sense and compassionate opinion. emoticon_xangel"
1553,notsarc,"I dunno about that, but possibly. They do know that those afflicted with ADD have some unusual structures in their brains too. Last I heard they were investigating the causality of homosexuality with developmental deficencies in the brain. The jury is not out yet"
1554,notsarc,So the stats come from John Lott.... Wasn't he the one who got caught making up statistics and impersonated a woman for three years to support the pro-gun cause? http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may...on/oe-wiener31http://whoismaryrosh.com/....a bizarre individual who I don't think can be trusted.
1555,notsarc,"Yes, but I think you missed my point. I stated this above, remember the prohabition? People actually drank MORE alchohal. Without a ban, law abiding citizens and criminals will have them, with a ban, there will be just criminals."
1556,notsarc,"Again: No, but I like to think they have! Im assuming you refer to council tax which is meant to be for community services like rubbish collection, fire protection etc... I agree I dont think we get value for money, but this isnt a tax on actually owning property. You pay it if you rent!"
1557,notsarc,"The maintenance of the integrity of the code is not dependent on selection, but dependent on internal variables (feedback system) for maintaining functional integrity. Again, showing another form of optimality.In article 10:Fascinating research was conducted whereby a sundry of different unnatural amino acids with novel three and four base codons have been selectively incorporated (engineered) into proteins yielding viable organisms.An intriguing question arises from this research. It is easy to imagine these to arise through chance and selection (e.g. amino acids with photoaffinity) and then be incorporated into the standard code. Yet the code seems to remain stagnant. For billions of year after fixation, little evolution happened in the code. Why? Did it arrive at a global optimum in a pre-existing fitness landscape, with a pre-existing fitness function?Finally, Article 11:The article cites many of the optimal properties above and concludes:"
1558,notsarc,"Exactly. That the change in moth color was due to natural selection was first posed in about 1896 by J.W. Tutt. The funny thing is that as pollution increased, the moths turned black, and then as the pollution was cleaned up, they turned white again. carbonaria have become pretty scarce."
1559,notsarc,"It is disappointing that you would continue with this mistake. I said that God is both knowable and unknowable. You simply think that equates to the same thing, and thus you argue against what you believe I say, rather than what I said."
1560,notsarc,"Demographics plays a role, but it does not explain away the whole shift in the numbers."
1561,notsarc,"I can well believe that pandion cannot answer this question; no one can accurately answer it. We know that baldness, as a genetic condition, is polygenetic (ie it's controlled by multiple genes) and autosomal (the genes [or at least the bulk of them] do not reside on the X or Y chromosomes). Despite being autosomal, people appear statistically slightly more likely to exhibit balness if the trait comes from their mother's side of the family. Even if we knew precisely which genes were involved and which of those genes your kids had, we still cannot tell you the likihood of your children being bald. The chances of the gene combination being expressed in the correct way to cause baldness are dependent on age, hormone levels, stress and probably a variety of other environmental conditions."
1562,notsarc,"Again???? Gun control laws by design are meant to kept inner city citizens (i.e. black) from owning guns... Liberal terms such as ""saturday night special"" all have racist undertones. Also since the majority of gun violence in the US is minority on minority... Who are these laws meant to target?"
1563,notsarc,"You are the only one defending them now...the funny part it, planned parenthood had the stats as reasons why abortion should be legal (or is legal). But wait! As we established the number of people that died from abortions went down to under a thousand so this reason is still not accurate and is still misleading. Anymore ideas?"
1564,notsarc,"And that's the rub: it never has (apart from when it has of course, with the various versions that exist). You choose to put faith in the writings of a primitive bronze age society. I prefer to trust a textbook that is regularly updated to reflect our latest findings; our most up to date and accurate knowledge of the world."
1565,notsarc,"Actually, it is quite correct. You misunderstand. The text book was trying to make it simple so that you would understand. The text book wasn't simple enough. The first record of carbonaria was in 1848. The discussion you quote was trying to explain quite simply, so that you might understand why the change took place. There is no record of anyone ever seeing a carbonaria before 1848. It is probably a safe assumption that an occasional mutation caused some to be born from time to time, but they were not able to reproduce to the extent that they were ever noted before 1848."
1566,notsarc,"we do......most fossils found are surface finds -- which means anything found on the ground probably contradicts uniformitarian principles because every fossil found laying on the ground probably -- according to ToE -- did not die at the same time. For example, many mammal bones are found on the surface -- yet so are dinosaur and other ""ancient"" bones from animals that supposedly lived millions of years beforehand. Of course evolutionists will come back and claim ""erosion"" with no evidence of such, not to mention how rock can be removed from bone after millions of years of being cemented to it.I've got a 900-page book called ""Hidden Archeology"" (Cremo) that dives into hundreds of fossils and artifacts that are in the ""wrong"" strata. Your assertion is blatantly false."
1567,notsarc,"And if you don't think it was justified? It's a public alley, she can walk down it whenever she wants without justifying herself to anyone."
1568,notsarc,"Certainly he did. I have known many scientists (mostly biologists) who had a similar attitude. The problem is that you have it upside down. The study of glorious, naturalistic science informs us of God's creation. You are trying to impose your childish version of your god on the universe."
1569,notsarc,"I agree it's a threat to us but the point is whether it's really caused by increaing amount of carbon dioxide and how big the threat is.Maybe global warming is just a part of process of global climate change which occured several times long time ago, ie, ice age things like that.As far as I know, global warming is one of the catastrophe which leads to extinction of human beings. However, there might be another problems which are also big threat to us and all creatures on the earth.Anyway, I'm not an expert of environment, so I might be wrong but at least I can say it seems there are some bad effetcts of global warming such as rising sea level, abnormal climate pattern, things like that.We should do something, which might not be appropriate way to solve the problem but it's surely the beginning."
1570,notsarc,because that's the subject of this thread: what designing a solution to a problem actually entails.
1571,notsarc,"I see the difference, but that's not what Obama is trying to do. He got us to buy the pig at a firesale and is hoping to make money selling it back to the original farmer or give it to the fieldhands."
1572,notsarc,"I argue against them with regards to whatever argument they muster.
 Do we have any of those on this message board?
 Because from what I can see, it's primarily the ""religious"" argument counter..."
1573,notsarc,"the reason why premise 1 can logically stand is that God is first of all defined as the ""greatest possible being"". no matter what reality we are considering, such a thing as the greatest possible being in that relity must exist. ""greatest"" is a superlative, compared to all other beings that existits like ""the oldest man alive"". no matter what scenario, such a person as the oldest man alive will always exist, therefore such a man (that fits that definition) will have a necessary existence"
1574,notsarc,"What people say does not matter.
 There is simply no legitimate rational basis for this assertion."
1575,notsarc,"I think it is very difficult, if not impossible to prove a negative."
1576,notsarc,"Do you want to explain what you think the problem is? You're going to see a much larger change if you start fiddling with the controls than if you were replacing bases within the protein coding sequence - a lot of those wouldn't change anything in the protein, and a lot of the changes to the protein wouldn't have a significant effect either."
1577,notsarc,"See the refutations of Augustines various proofs for the details. Its not actually very interesting since its so elementary. There are many disproofs on the net in addition.
 
 One novel one which seems rather neat is this one."
1578,notsarc,"Fair enough; I was just simplifying and using 'pro-life' as a dichotomy with 'pro-choice'. Clearly, it's not that simple.
 
 With regards to religion in the debate - that's fine by me for this thread*."
1579,notsarc,"Exactly, which brings us back to square 1. Creationism is based on religion, and Evolution is based on the Scientific method, but is not proven. Creationism isnt even near being proven. So, why would you try to impose your religious beliefs on public school children?"
1580,notsarc,"murder would violate the common law.People should be free to do as they please, but an employer should also be free to employ who they see fit.we are not talking about legalized beatings.And are you... now saying being gay is a belief system?or are they born that way?which is it?personally, i would never agree to discriminate against people for being gay..however... if they are flaboyantly gay... then i do favor discrimination.there is no need to flaunt it.. as it disturbs people.but if they act normal.. speak normal.. and seem normal, then there would be no justification for firing them in my book.-Mosheh Thezion"
1581,notsarc,Men shouldn't be deciding because they can't get pregnant after being raped. When was the last time a man's life was ever at risk because his wife was pregnant?
1582,notsarc,If you can't eliminate demand you could try to limit supply and control access to that supply.
1583,notsarc,"Actually both are relative in every situation. Especially ""The Truth"" as espoused by religious fundamentalists such as yourself, as there are as many different versions of the truth as there religious fundamentalists."
1584,notsarc,"Well, you didn't have my experiences, now did you? Each woman who has an abortion coul have innumerous circumstances and experiences."
1585,notsarc,"Thats true. However, do we not have a state of reasonable compromise at the moment?"
1586,notsarc,That's why the Second Amendment protects the private ownership of arms like the .50 BMG and other such powerful weapons.
1587,notsarc,Thanks. Well I'm a resident of California currently but my partner has orders to Virginia. If they allow outside residents to apply for a license we'll do it Considering DC is only a four hour drive or so.
1588,notsarc,"Which still proves nothing in regards to climate change or global warming
 
 Why do people seem to think that for global warming to be a fact that it would have to stop snowing?"
1589,notsarc,"As was pointed out in some of your own quotations, survival is not an 'end' of natural selection. Natural selection is the differential reproductive success of organisms with more favorable suites of characteristics. It is a statistical tendency. Individual organisms may work to survive, but they also work to reproduce. That's as close as it gets to ""purpose."" And as you know, Darwin's favored term was natural selection. He never used the phrase ""survival of the fittest"" without also making a reference to natural selection. The opposite is not the case. Since Darwin's time ""survival of the fittest"" has been rejected by evolutionary biologists because it is such a poor representation of the extent of the theory."
1590,notsarc,"But if the state refuses to recognise their right to commit to each other in a legal union, then they are being denied at least one right which is available to everyone else.
 
 This can also affect legal entitlements.

1591,notsarc,"How does this have anything to do with marriage? Reproduction occurs outside of marriage and has done so long before man became civilized. 
 
 Permitting only gay marriages won't decrease numbers. Increased family planning and birth control will."
1592,notsarc,"The 10 commandments are a real time story, told and recorded by the person with whom it happened to... Moses.Genesis, is a history lesson, told by a man who had no understanding of modern science, or the language to describe it in that fashion... Moses.If God chose to reveal to you in some special way, the origins of the universe, for you to write down for generations to come.. you would write a different story than Moses. Just as one person views art differently from another person.I see no duplicity between the two."
1593,notsarc,"Actually JP so far 5 states have passed gay marriage so no not every time it is put to a vote do we lose.And how am I forcing anyone to accept gay marriage? Am I forcing these voters to attend my wedding or dare I say be in a marriage themselves?And I cannot agree with you more about changing the image of the gay community as a whole.. We are not all a bunch of promiscuous sex crazed people running around...What I find funny is once strait people find out how boring we really are, and how we pay taxes just like every other joe schmo they'll think nothing more of special rights lol...But actually like I stated earlier in another thread if those unions constituted the same legal rights as married couples I would be content."
1594,notsarc,"what is your basis? what do you mean by ""evil""?"
1595,notsarc,"He made a post suggesting you were a troll, it has been removed it seems. Anyway, glad to help."
1596,notsarc,"So,in your opinion,are you saying that this invading force that you are talking about,would never bat an eye as to whether the people of the USA are armed to the teeth or not in their pre-war planning?Surely any country that tried to overtake the USA would suffer severe damage to its military in all aspects.And even if it succeeded,it would still have to deal with our armed citizens.Are you trying to tell me that this is not a ditterent?Sure,if you dream up some DARTH VADER size invasion,no one stands a chance.But if you put it real world perspective.Say,2 or 3 of the bigger countries got together and decided to over take the USA.I would assume ""armed citizens"" would be a major factor in deciding whether to invade or not."
1597,notsarc,"At what cost? How many civil rights are you willing to give up in the name of a few less murders each year? Are you perfectly willing to be stopped by the police on a block-by-block basis and forced to show identification and traveling papers, all the while the officers on location are pointing their guns right at your head, ready to XXXX you away at the first sign of a twitch or if you display even a hint of hesitation to comply?How desperately do you crave a police state? How much do you favor a nationwide curfew where violators can be arrested by the police and held without legal counsel for an indefinite period of time? Do you favor the use of physical and mental torture to force convictions even from the innocent?"
1598,notsarc,"So... humans are born with cancer cells already inside them?
 
 I'm not talking about what cancer does once it's there, I'm talking about what it does in the first place."
1599,notsarc,"Not really, this case was different in that the state was the guardian. Although I am sure it has happened before. As for three reasons...1) The state of Florida doesn't believe a 13 yr old can have sex (consent) so why couold she be able to cosent to an abortion?2) The State is the guardian and they should be able to say where she can and can't go as a parent would be able to do....and the state has a law against taking kids to abortion clinics.3) ABORTION IS KILLING A KID. Maybe that doesn't matter for most :-/"
1600,notsarc,I can. Americans won the Revolutionary War which was primarily a guerilla war. emoticon_xgood
1601,notsarc,"Because their axiom is that the bible is infallible, so any problems with reading it are the reader's fault, whereas yours is that contradiction implies error. What Ken's saying is that we can't draw a distinction between your axioms and those of a bible literalist in terms of which is 'right', because axioms are stated not proved: axioms define what is 'right'.To reiterate: his error is in forgetting that the universe operates according to its own axioms, whatever they may be, and we can judge whether or not our axioms are congruent."
1602,notsarc,"So the main disagreements between fundamentalists and theistic evolutionists are what are, and are not first (primary) causes. And atheists believe everything is a second cause (or first cause) with no intelligence behind it. It still doesn't make any sense to me why theistic evolutionists are in such agreement with atheists, and so far apart from ""fundamentalists"". "
1603,notsarc,"If I were to become upset merely because you told me the ideas were wrong, you might have a point. But I don't; never have, so far as I recall. An idea can't be stupid, or simple-minded. An idea can be right or wrong, or perhaps partly both. When you describe an idea as stupid, you are saying it is wrong and one would have to be stupid to think that. When you describe an idea as simple minded you are saying it is wrong and one would have to be simple-minded to think that."
1604,notsarc,"I admit I didn't know who Sermonti was at first. A search on Wikipedia returned Ciacco, one of the characters of the Divine Comedy by Dante. a Google search led me to Giuseppe Sermonti who has written against evolution since 1980. He is known for expressing the need for 'purpose' to be part of science, giving such examples as: ""In the presence of the inducer (lactose) the cell produces an enzyme with the purpose of utilizing lactose4)."" In case you never took biochemistry, this is an incredibly well understood chemical process and requires no purpose beyond the interaction of well understood chemicals."
1605,notsarc,"The state right before the Big Bang didn't have H, He, or any space."
1606,notsarc,I think it is simply been more socially acceptable for women to cry openly.

1608,notsarc,"382 - 405 are the dates I have, under Pope Damasus I."
1609,notsarc,I think its actually the states job...the judiciary does need to overturn Roe v. Wade to get this done though...which doesn't mean it becomes illegal.

1615,notsarc,"Today's students are tomorrow's scientists. They are unlikely to study something that, if they hear about it at all, they hear about it on a less serious level than they do the happenstance origins of atheist evolution. To reduce ID to other classes like literature or social sciences, etc. (where poetry, fiction, and prehistoric beliefs are the subject matter) is nothing more than a clever, dishonest attempt to belittle it."
1616,notsarc,But it is OK to teach your religion in public school classrooms? Is that what you mean? What about my religion. Is it OK for me to teach it to your children against your will?

1618,notsarc,I know what moral relativism is (although you should be aware it has multiple meanings); I don't know what the sentence:
1619,notsarc,"Mach, your ability to make the wrong argument on the wrong post continues. I ask a question of this person, you reply not to them, but to me, and with ad hominem, and a 'just-so' statement."
1620,notsarc,"If you don't mind, could you just outline your paradigm please?
 
 and also, when you say you have experience, do you mean in ""real"" debating (HS and College) or just on this and other sites?"
1621,notsarc,"I didn't answer or you didn't understand? Actually I did answer. The knee joint I described is from a bipedal hominid - there is no question about it. The skull, even though I gave it very ape-like features, is from a biped. There are many examples of what I described."
1622,notsarc,"But even worse, even if there were some unknown mechanism to cause such movement, it would generate heat. The heat generated by the creation of the mountains of the world would be more than enough to reduce the entire surface to molten lava. Add to that the fact that the condensation of the ""vapor canopy"" would release enough heat to boil all of the water on earth. "
1623,notsarc,"wow... you are bent on harping on creationists arguments at whatever the cost.first of all, you are not even considering that the majority of people are misinformed of what evolution is not because they have creationist motives, but because they go to the dictionary for definitions"
1624,notsarc,"What I've been saying here, and after awhile - the guilt, depression, etc - will get buried, deeper & deeper - but no negative/damaging experiences leave people. They stay quietly in the background-computer base -until, as you said: Hopefully, the person ""finds some way of forgiving themselves"", right. But what about in the mean-time? - And we know, from research & quite a number of Healers, that rot (inside a person) is damaging... and often in very unsuspecting ways.Much better to life benevolently, in the first place.Annie"

1627,notsarc,The short answer is that it isn't. See the details here: Phil Plait
1628,notsarc,"Actually, that's your job, since it's already generally assumed that guns don't fuel aggression. You're the one who brought that point up, it's your job.You need unquestionable proof that the mere presence of a gun fuels aggression, and so far, none has been presented to me."
1629,notsarc,"Well, this gets rather complicated. A very young child does not get to choose his or her adoptive parents. Who decides on who adopts whom depends on the kind of adoption and the policies of the particular adoption system. In private domestic adoption, the birth mother usually gets to decide on who will adopt her baby. The foster care system is organized differently, and international adoption is different still and depends on the country from which the child is being adopted. So it's pretty much impossible to generalize about adoption policies and practices. They vary greatly.The point is that the purpose of adoption is to protect the rights of the child."
1630,notsarc,"Besides being terribly wrong, that's not evolution and has nothing to do with evolution. Perhaps because you know so little about orbital physics you think that the sun rising and setting is any kind of evidence for the earth orbiting the sun. It isn't. You would have to actually understand a little about it to know that. Nobody, from Copernicus onward, used observations of the revolution of the earth to conclude that the earth was in orbit around the sun."
1631,notsarc,"interestingly, single-celled organisms and ""simple organisms"" (those with less functionality) look more alike than they do to mammals and other more ""complex"" organisms..."
1632,notsarc,"This whole riff where people talk about preventing employers from firing gays JUST cause they are gay as a ""special right"" is something that seems to fool those who are prejudiced against gays...... but for most people, they recognize it as a propagandic phrasing with little merit.I think our laws should include something that prevents people from firing employees based on the employee's sexual orientation.But to utilize your phrasing Archie, do you think that religion is something that deserves ""special rights""?"
1633,notsarc,"You forgot to fully quote John 8:18. here is the rest: and the Father that sent Me beareth witness of Me. He isn't bearing witness to Himself here. Two witnesses are, one of which is Himself, which is why He said in John 8:17 It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. John 5:30-32 is saying this exact same thing. "
1634,notsarc,"So much for choice. Obama's little socialist minions want to use the tax system to collect healthcare premiums if you don't comply. After all, getting employers to collect income taxes before you even see your money has worked for these leeches in the pas"

 I didn't think so."
1636,notsarc,"Consciousness is created (in my view) by the brain - but I guess it could be described as non-material in the sense that the certainty of its detection is a subjective event. I know that the activity of brain ""waves"" can be monitored, but the stream of consciousness that they give rise to is entirely interior to the mental environment."

1638,notsarc,"The other forest does not photosynthesize all year round, the other forest is also in just as much danger as the rainforest. For some reason, radical environmentalists choose to place undue emphasis on the de-forestation of rainforest rather than global forest as a whole."
1639,notsarc,"No. It doesn't refer to ""advances"" of life over time at all. It refers to changes of life over time. To call any of those changes ""advances"" is subjective."
1640,notsarc,"How does being poor limit your responsibility to protect yourself? I know a poor woman who has 10 kids just hoping that one day she would find a man that would be willing to help raise the rest. Also, what do you mean by ""less fortunate? It never happened but she kept having kid after kid and hoping it would. Should she be excused for her behavior because she is poor? No, she kept going to BARS looking for good men. Bad choices = bad outcome. Do you think that this is proof that abortion is necessary? Nope, abortion IS NOT the answer in cases like this, only responsibility can solve the problem. The bad thing is that only one of the men do anything for the children and he doesn't do enough. She has never filed for child support and the kids are almost never disciplined. "
1641,notsarc,"Responding to the question in the topic, I tend to use the case of Baby Fae.
 
 Freethoughtradio also has short blurbs called ""What's the Harm?"" that gives some examples of ""the natural harm caused by supernatural belief."""
1642,notsarc,"That's certainly your right, but supersport is interested in hawking a religious agenda, not a scientific one. He may want it disguised as a scientific one, but a perusal of his posts here bely that desire."
1643,notsarc,And think of what other animals have built (and for an actual purpose). Take a look at a bee hive. It's so complex and so perfect for them. They built that. An ant hill is at least 20 times the size of an ant. That's 120 feet for us (for a 6 foot person).
1644,notsarc,"How do you know square circles do not exist? Modern man could've named a square circle something different than it is. Ancient man could've called an object a square circle. For a question like that, you would have to search the universe to be 100% sure square circles do not exist. "
1645,notsarc,That distinction may be irrelevant since they do say that no god that any religious person believes in exists. And that is what I was getting at originaly. Still I think that the idea that the existence of all religious gods can be ultimately refuted based on the logic you bring up is invalid.
1646,notsarc,"So it's just as we've said: registration can and does lead to confiscation down the line. And now we have further proof that we're right about what we say.Government gets the weapon registered, then they can, at any time and for any reason, demand it be surrendered to the authorities or else punishment will be administered."
1647,notsarc,"Almost all did. In fact, probably all that you are aware of did. Even the energy in the steak that you eat came from the sun ultimately. The thing is that evolution seems to have resulted in an organism to take advantage of almost every form of available energy. And what energy is left by ""higher"" animals is used by others - insects, microbes - until there is little usable energy left. That even goes so far that there are some organisms that get their energy from geothermal sources - no light involved."
1648,notsarc,"I know that sometimes when a woman is on the pill, and they happen to get pregnant anyways, it will cause you to miscarry (not always, but sometimes). Usually it happens very early in the pregnancy before they realize they are even pregnant. But I don't know if I would call that abortion as in the way the term is normally used, because the woman isn't terminating the pregnancy on purpose, although miscarriage is called 'spontanious abortion'.. I also remember hearing from a friend of mine, who is Catholic, that in her church any type of birth control is considered wrong.. I'm not sure on that though, since I'm not Catholic myself."
1649,notsarc,"Well, there's plenty of scientific evidence about fetal development, such that we can confidently say no ""person"" is established up to a certain stage in a pregnancy.I think the decision should be up to the woman, as under U.S. law. Between her and her doctor, whoever else she freely chooses to share with. I think, at some point, in a normally developing pregnancy, a very fuzzy looking line is crossed. But that's why we have state regulations during the third trimester.IMO, Latin American countries, until this day, are unduly under the influence of the Church, superstition and ignorance."
1650,notsarc,"Actually it's funny. Mice deprived of THC (it naturally occurs in the brain) are smarter than regular mice, but die much earlier. Not because of cancer, but of ""natural"" causes. It wouldn't be hugely surprising if THC supplements made you live longer, albeit at a lower level of intelligence, even if the smoking aspect of taking it had negative effects that counterbalanced that."
1651,notsarc,"And like the ""chicken and egg"" question, where the answer is ""a bird other than a chicken"", so the answer to your little riddle is likely to be: RNA."
1652,notsarc,"I think this is a bad way to put it...the evidence that they earth has been warming since we have had the ability to measure temperature is overwhelming...the cause is unknown and whether or not it is natural is unknown. It does seem fairly narasistic to think in 100 years we have caused so much damage to an earth that at least has been here 10,000 years."
1653,notsarc,"I can see what you are saying. It's pretty much true...being a Jewish homosexual, I know it first hand. But just for once, couldn't they pick on somebody else?It seems almost like a bully tactic for the Christian heterosexuals who are against same sex marriages to pick on someone who doesn't have a legal leg to stand on...that's sad."
1654,notsarc,This coming from the person that makes insane claims without providing evidence. Atleast provide some when asked!
1655,notsarc,"Each side tries to support their own worldview. There are two positions, and sides are chosen. It's human nature."
1656,notsarc,"Lots of luck on getting any kind of intelligent reply.
 
 Have you read the John Woodmorappe book on the ark?"
1657,notsarc,Well then move out of the rough areas. Stop staying in them like some battered spouse who can't seem to break the cycle of abuse and leave their partner.Stop whining about how bad life is because there are guns in America. Imagine how much better if would be if the drug dealers and mass murderers weren't allowed to walk the streets as if they owned them.
1658,notsarc,"And you know what? No amount of epigenetic change is going to turn a fruitfly embryo into a human. One of the reasons they are different, and subject to different epigenetic regimes, is because despite genetic homologies (which evolutionary theory predicts), their genomes are significantly different. They have some different genes, in different quantities, and in different arrangements, and that is critical. Epigenetics alone can't take one species and turn it into another, so far as anyone knows. It takes genomic restructuring, and that happens only through genetic mutation."
1659,notsarc,No contradiction; the Permian extinction was the most severe in history and noted as such in the page linked.
1660,notsarc,"I think you can forget about God the super ""engineer"" on this one: your final question contains a necessary and sufficient condition to explain the case."
1661,notsarc,"Not by any means. Evolution works on genetic change that future generations will inherit. Adaptation does no such thing. It changes an individual, but not its genes.For example, if my parents volunteered to be part of a scientific experiment where they two additional arms fused onto their body before I was ever conceived, I would not be born with two extra arms.On the other hand, if a genetic mutation made it advantageous to have two additional arms, and both my parents had that mutation, I would be born with both arms."
1662,notsarc,"No. Unless you wish to actually undertake the study of the relevant science, that's what you need to do. Creationists do the same thing. the problem is that creationists tend to accept the word of those who aren't any more educated than they are. Thus, a creationist will accept Hovind's dust on the moon argument or his shrinking sun argument as ""proof"" of a young earth."
1663,notsarc,"How do you define evolution? If you don't see any, then you aren't using the definition used by evolutionary biologists. The question is who should define the vocabulary of evolutionary biologist, evolutionary biologists or creationists?"
1664,notsarc,"You must be assuming that the entire story is true. Again, how can anyone possibly answer this?"
1665,notsarc,But you just said that the program was designed. You seem to be having trouble making up your mind.
1666,notsarc,But there were not always laws on the books that prevented these things. I was presenting a hypothetical situation in which those laws are not already on the books. The situtation was intended to show only that a ruling allowing same-sex marriage would not have to cost companies a dime.
1667,notsarc,"False. Beneficial mutations in bacteria have been observed in the lab. Far from wrecking the system, they allowed the system to continue to live while those without the mutations died: the mutations improved the system's ability to survive and perpetuate itself."
1668,notsarc,"I think that you missed the point of the argument. VT is arguing that the low birth rate in the West is attributable to high abortion rates and the high birth rates amongst Arabs creates a numbers game in favor of the Arabs. Since they respect life (their own, that is) more than the West, their numbers are growing much quicker, while our lack of respect for human life is causing the gap to widen."
1669,notsarc,Because there are people who are trying to deny the theory of evolution it's place as a vital part of public school's biology curriculum.
1670,notsarc,The human collective is the authority. One major advantage of this authority over a theistic one is that it actually exists.
1671,notsarc,"Actually, as long as any group is not breaking laws, their ownership of guns is legal. The KKK can even own guns as long as the KKK is abiding by the law. I noticed Brady refered to the KKK as a mob, I get the picture Brady thinks that if gun owners gather for whatever the reason, that we are mobs as well, but when his side gathers they are an organization. And no Brady, I dont belong to or associate with hate groups."
1672,notsarc,"We don't know for sure. Traditionally thought to be Homer but is probably from oral tradition. Single authorship itself is disputed. Beyond that, I don't know much about it.
 
 What is your point in asking this question?"
1673,notsarc,How does anyone deny someone the right to believe something? I don't understand what you're saying.
1674,notsarc,Then how exactly did a time capsule that was buried several feet underground get to the surface at the same rate as the surrounding area?
1675,notsarc,"We've covered that: zoos do not include predators or prey in those environments. And even if they didn't document minor phenotypic changes, they would surely notice a porcupine being born with no quills, or a tortoise with no shell!"
1676,notsarc,"Well yes, but thats not what DEFECTIVE GULO indicates. If one has external sources of vitamin C, GULO can mutate to be inactive without causing a problem, and once inactive the inactive gene can be inherited without causing problems so long as vitamin C intake is high enough. An inactive GULO indicates that the species has external sources of vitamin C which is essential to many metabolic processes."
1677,notsarc,"ah, but why do you use the word concept for both evolution and intelligent design? Evolution is a theory that has been studied, given evidence, and offered up for peer review. Intelligent design is simply a concept, a single belief. Evolution is a theory that can be backed up and the world can benefit from it. How can the world benefit from a simple statement that there is an intelligent designer. This has absolutely no application to the natural world today."
1678,notsarc,"As Kronus explained, there are an infinite number of ""colors,"" because ""color"" is a function of wavelength."
1679,notsarc,"Yes, T. Kennedy is the alias of a known terrorist, and Ted Kennedy got punished because of it. And many are advocating that such a system be used to deny Second Amendment rights and be used to try innocent people in a court of law."
1680,notsarc,And that's what I'm talking about. It doesn't have to have been 'explained' to me. I already know that's your view.
1681,notsarc,"Steve - its not about qualifications - its about impact. Women are the ones who get pregnant, we should have more authority in the matter."
1682,notsarc,Bad comparisons. A fair comparison would be comparing the total number of defensive gun uses to the total number of gun crimes (not just limiting it to gun homicides).
1683,notsarc,"They originally might have been an arbitrary guess, but experience of all humans always has given them a very high probability of being true (at least the existence of the outside world, the others are abstract logical concepts that don't have a physical reality, just an abstract one)."
1684,notsarc,"They didn't take? That's weird cuz they work for me just fine. Maybe if you copy them and paste them directly into google and click enter, you'll get to them because they are good links. Give it a shot and good luck. emoticon_xgood"
1685,notsarc,"Well, yes. Eleven years is quite swift, but it actually supports the theory of evolution through natural selection. The estimates of the speed of evolution that you seem to be depending on were done by George Gaylord Simpson way back in the 1940s or 1950s. Since then, we have observed fruit flies, as well as other specimens, to evolve quite rapidly, showing significant evolution in only a decade or so. More recently, however, scientists have been able to observe evolution in natural settings and have found that it can sometimes be quite rapid when environmental change is rapid. Besides the studies that Reznick did on guppies, there are also the studies of the Galapagos finches by the grants, and studies of anole lizards in the Bahamas. These are observable phenotypical changes, not speciation events."
1686,notsarc,"It is the same as you saying ""you can't know anything of the unknowable"""
1687,notsarc,"Well, viability now is around 23-25 weeks gestation and really is based on weight more than age. Howeverm the past push towards heroic intervention is now tempered by the rather horrific disabilities and complications seen at the younger age"
1688,notsarc,"We don't need another one that does the same thing, and can put an honest gun owner in a jam. This is after all as Nato 556 points out, a due process violation.
   Don't lie for the other guy. National Sports Shooting Foundation campaign."
1689,notsarc,I think you have your image of an assault weapon slightly skewed. an assault weapon by its very name is a weapon designed to harm another human. this does not mean full auto it just means that it was never designed to be a target/hunting/self defense weapon.
1690,notsarc,"But it does restrict criminal access to such items. And it has nothing to do with Tyranny. If a government feels that a certain measure will protect its people and society at the cost of restricting an item that is dangerous I can understand it. It is not tyranny, it is a government doing what it is supposed to. Again I personally disagree with the decision, but I do not believe it is anybodys 'right' to own a weapon nor do I equate such restrictions with extreme forms of government."
1691,notsarc,How would you know about who winds up dead more? You don't prove anything either.
1692,notsarc,"Well, it happens in virtually every thread.Some disagreements are between individuals of essentially the same basic system [Protestant Christian vs Protestant Christian], [atheist rationalist vs atheist rationalist]. Many disagreements are between individual of differing belief systems. In such cases the individuals often use the same word to mean two different things.What is evidence? Well, that will depend on your core belief system. Sacred writings may be excellent evidence for your belief system, but when you say the Qu'ran proves an issue, the Christian says Thats not evidence!.One side tries to convince the other side that their core beliefs are incorrect, so they really have no evidence for their position."
1693,notsarc,"That's not evidence, that's an assertion. As for my dogs (cats), yes. They do put on a winter coat in the much warmer winter climate than Arizona in which I live. So I return to my original question, on what evidence do you base your claim that an arctic fox would not change color in the winter in Arizona?"
1694,notsarc,"Yea I know that, but there is no ""abortion"" pill that will terminate a fetus."
1695,notsarc,"The egyptians predicted his birth, death, WWI, WWII, and they have predict the supposed end of the world. Are you saying that this religion was wrong? They predicted a lot more that I have not put that have come true."
1696,notsarc,"True, but the one after this one will be. I think many sane people see the writing on the wall which shows this health care bill only gives you the costs of the current US system with the defects of a universal system. I'm not much for conspiracy theories but if I were I'd think the government was purposely driving health care off a cliff to get universal care in place. "
1697,notsarc,"If a woman likes pregnancy, that is her preference.
 
 If a woman hates pregnancy, that is also her preference.
 
 Simple as that."
1698,notsarc,"Felony possession of a firearm is five years in prison. Gun trafficking is ten years per gun. Murder brings the death penalty. None of these punishments are handed down for the crimes that get committed.
 
 It's a matter of quantity over quality."
1699,notsarc,"That's probably true. Creationists believe that theories are ad hoc stories. Creationist have been raised to know the answers before they have asked the questions. Thus, any assertion that supports the ""theory"" is considered valid evidence, even though there is no evidence to support the assertion and even though plain logic and real science show the assertion to be nonsense."
1700,notsarc,I think our culture is going to play a big role in this as well. I think that is where the majority of this problem lies.
1701,notsarc,"Actually, the process of fossilisation is not slow and can be done relatively quickly. All what you need is for sediments to quickly cover a dead (or an alive body - as what would have happened to Noah's Flood) and hence, fossilsation can occur rapidly; evolutionarly speaking, fossils take millions of years to fossilise a bone, but unless the bone is covered by sediments quickly, the bone will never fossilise. "
1702,notsarc,And they could have experienced more without gun control. You're jumping to conclusions.
1703,notsarc,"I am curious about your position. Why have you chosen the nervous system and brain and organs as the cutoff points for the humanmeter? Have you done so arbitrarily? Does this mean that if these are not as you said ""completed and operating (developed)"" then we are not human? If this were true there would be alot of handicapped people who are not human. Christopher Reeve and all the other quadrapalegic and parapalegics like him would be in trouble. What IQ determines a fully developed brain?"
1704,notsarc,"I think you need to answer the same question I asked the other guy, who is God?"
1705,notsarc,"Sure, but then you get into all sorts of problems of classifications, slippery slopes, and other awkward messes. Arguing whether an embryo or a fetus is a person seems to raise more trouble than it might solve. It seems better to err on the side of caution and devise a pro-choice argument that assumes the embryo or fetus to be a person rather than worry whether they are a person."
1706,notsarc,"Yes. Because evolution requires an old earth, supersport has lumped geology into the evil conspiracy. As our best explanations for the formation of the earth appeal to cosmology, that field as well as astronomy fall within the realm of quack science, according to supersport. In fact, every scientific discipline that has any connection whatsoever to evolution must be corrupt; obviously, chemistry is one of them (we can't make glycogen or DNA without magical, ""atheistic"" polymerization, right?)."
1707,notsarc,"But no one is trying to disprove it.
 
 But, the burden of any proof is on those making a positive claim.
 
 Unless there is a way to test for a designer, intellegent design is not science."
1708,notsarc,"I believe the question was ""who?""I'm christian and I believe in evolution. Whether it contradicts the Old Testament or not makes no difference to me. Jesus contradicted the Old Testament.The Bible is the inspired word of God, not a dictation to scribes. Men wrote the allegories describing the creation of things.Saying that mankind took a long time to understand certain things is not limiting the power of God. He could have chosen to make early man Einsteinian, but He didn't. He could have chosen for mankind to bypass the flat-earth concept, but He didn't. He could have chosen for all humans to be highly intelligent, but He didn't. What He did was to leave us alone and let us figure things out on our own, including how long it took to get where we are now."
1709,notsarc,"To you, it may be an incorrect statement. But if it is, you have to tell me what it is you kill and take the life away from when you abort the zygote. Not knowing if it is being killed or not knowing someone wants to kill it makes no difference. Injustice is still practiced there, and not even some abortion doctors realize it."
1710,notsarc,it has been known for a long time -- it's just been surpressed because it contradicts genetic determinism and neo-darwinsm in general.
1711,notsarc,"And as far as we know, they are undirected. Evidence to the contrary?"
1712,notsarc,But the law of angular momentum does not require that all parts of a spinning object spin in the same way now does it. If so then something like a rotary engine for an aircraft would not be possible!
1713,notsarc,"**True, and the confusion was my bad, as explained already. However, the fact of revertant mutation in eusocial bacteria colonies, as demonstrated by Ames and by Cairns, still shoots great big holes in the darwinist assumptions arising out of your old war-horses, Luria & Delbruck '43, and its ""clone"", Lederberg and Lederberg '52."
1714,notsarc,The OP assumes ID is real. Asking specifics is ridiculous because we do not know how the proof of ID would be revealed or exactly what the intelligent ' force ' or manifestation would be
1715,notsarc,"But what about the hypothetical?I can't think of a single child on this planet that has never been exposed to the ideas of the supernatural.So, what I was asking is whether faith is nature or nurture.That's why I brought up kids being afraid of the dark, likely no matter what anyone tells them. I think it's this fear of the unknown linked to the ""logical"" brain of a human that possibly creates this need for explanations. But faith involves specifics, so when the specifics are filled in and ""make sense"" to more than one person, these specific ""explanations"" can be passed down.So I don't know how much of faith is nature and how much is nurture."
1716,notsarc,"So lets say that if, and I know this has nothing to do with the topic of gay marriage, but do the people have a right to amend the constitution to introduce slavery? Does the majority have a right to deny a minority freedom? I already know you answer. You believe in the tyranny of the majority.Why do you want the people to vote to take other people marriages away? I do not understand your reasoning on this. Besides you have never answered my question.Do you have any compassion?"
1717,notsarc,"Thats a very good question. To be honest - I would prefer no legislation period - but I would not get up in arms about a late term restriction like I described because 1) a fetus could very well survive outside of the mom at that point, 2) most reputable doctors won't conduct an abortion at that stage without a legitimate medical reason anyway."
1718,notsarc,"You are perhaps thinking of the Miller-Urrey experiment. No one expected life to appear. They were merely curious about what would happen if they simulated the conditions of the early Earth.Since then, we've found pretty much the same thing in the interior of stony meteorites, including an excess of L-forms. So, it's confirmed the findings of Miller-Urey. None of this has anything to do with evolution, however.Evolution is the change in allele frequencies over time. This happens in populations; individuals don't evolve. Everything else in evolution is an elaboration of this phenomenon."
1719,notsarc,And I would agree with you as long as all marriages for all couples were called civil unions and there is no two tiered system.
1720,notsarc,"That's fair enough, but I just think it's important to at least acknowledge and realize that the unborn baby does have worth and importance, and not just a piece of tissue as it's so often callously viewed."
1721,notsarc,"Again, they must be alive. Previously, you submitted that there are many problems with society and life or whatever. Could it be that some people might be able to survive those problems? Could it be that those survivors would be the ones to reproduce?"
1722,notsarc,"Well, first, those were Hebrews, not Christians. Secondly, the scripture doesn't say they raped them, it says ""keep them for yourselves."" That could mean rape, however, I'm pretty sure that was not Moses's intention. Also, the Hebrews considered it impure to lie with non-Hebrew women or men, so if there was any sexual immorality going on it was very small. However, that DOESN'T mean it was justified or right."
1723,notsarc,"That who knows? Your use of ""we"" does not include many religious folk I assume. I would claim to know of much interaction that God has and has had with the world."
1724,notsarc,"The value of logical reasoning is dependent upon your axioms. Highly religious people are no less capable of reasoning logically than anyone else - but the unshakeable axiom that their personal version of god really exists enters into every equation. For you, one axiom is the existence of Vitality; volition made quantifiable, and the other is that darwinian evolution must be wrong and worthless in every respect.There is no logical reason for you to deride NS the way you do; it's an integral part of any evolutionary theory that seeks to explain the big picture of how the organisms we see around us came to be; the occurrence of mutations, volitional or otherwise is not enough on its own. But your axioms prevent you from incorporating it into EAM and getting on with your life."
1725,notsarc,"Recent studies apparently show that pot is more harmful than you say. One joint is said to contain more carcinogens than four tobacco cigarettes.I doubt your 20,000 joints theory.You have a simplistic argument going for pot. I can't agree that legalizing all drugs would be a good thing either. Programs in Holland have failed to produce significant if any benefits to society in general. The druggies seem to have benefitted by having arrest-free drug zones and access to whatever they want, but the cost of drugs still requires some income, something that most of them likely do not have other than from crime, begging or social programs.One ""benefit"" I see from legalizing drugs is that the users could be more easily identified."
1726,notsarc,And this is evidence of creation... how? Please provide an explanation and a reference for how this is evidence of creation. Thank you! :-)
1727,notsarc,"I think it's hipocritical for pro-lifers to call themselves pro-life except for rape. It's either a child or it's not. If it is a child, then no matter what, the child must survive, becuase it has every right to. If the fetus isn't a child, then we can do whatever the hell we wnat with it. But it's a child, since humans only produce children, and not being of other speices, in accordance to the Principle of Biogenesis. Therefore, abortion is wrong in all cases."
1728,notsarc,"And, are ""birth"" parents obligated to the welfare of a zygote, an embryo, a fetus, do the zygotes, embryos, fetuses own ""birth"" parents?"
1729,notsarc,"I will answer the remainder later as I am pressed for time. Archaeopteryx is not a transitional form. It has well defined feathers. Where is the evidence for transition from scales to feathers that is predicted by evolution. Natural selection in particular but overall evolution. If you read Gould's original work he does not say what he says above and in fact actually contradicts it. It appears like a response that is back peddling at best. As I said, more later.EF"
1730,notsarc,"This is not true. Rather, when there is conflict between one's sanctity of life vs another's quality of life, the sanctity of life must win."
1731,notsarc,"The Brady Bill does not lower crime:http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/284/5/585A little dated, 1997, but also note that both Cook and Ludwig were both anti-gunners.""Brady Law Proponents: Ludwig, Cook, JAMA Among Lott's harshest critics have been anti-self-defense academics Professors Jens Ludwig and Philip J. Cook. In a study funded by the anti-self-defense Joyce Foundation and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) they set out to debunk Lott's findings regarding the Brady law. There was just one problem: they couldn't. ""http://rpc.senate.gov/~rpc/releases/1999/gc083100.htm"
1732,notsarc,Actually the details of HOW embryogenesis proceeds is becoming increasingly understood. And it goes way the heck beyond speculation. Check out how homeobox genes work and how regulation by master switches is understood as just two examples.
1733,notsarc,Even though I am for gay marriage I do agree. Correlation is not causation.
1734,notsarc,"This assumes brain-dead is a logical choice to consider one dead. Even so, it proves nothing about when life begins. What says they have to be the same? This is a classic example of a conclusion not following from the premise."
1735,notsarc,It doesn't make sense because no one makes that claim. There are some random events that take place that may have an effect on evolution. That does not mean that evolution is random.
1736,notsarc,Sorry to shatter you little world but this is happening it has been happening 25 years and it is happening now and it is completly legal no laws have been broken and yes there is a market for fetal tissue /limbs and bodies.Do some research you will be surprised what you will find.
1737,notsarc,"Congrats, may your marriage continue to be a happy one.If I may deviate from the original thread a bit I have a couple of questions that pertain to your specific situation. If they are too personnal please feel free to say so.Do you consider yourself to be any particular branch of Christian? ie. Lutheran, Catholic, Apiscopal (sp), etc.How do you reconcile your Christianity with the portions of the bible that specificly deal with homosexual activity as a sin? (If this question sounds rude please excuse me, I couldn't think of a better wording.)Thanks"
1738,notsarc,"And it is. The ToE is a theory, however. It explains evolution, which has been observed. Do not attempt to deny that."
1739,notsarc,"And a woman's life choices, health, and finances aren't up for hi-jacking. Every time a lifer talks about demanding the nine month rape, they talk about what the baby deserves or not deserves and how it shouldn't be punished. This SCREAMS that you don't value and respect women. The very idea that a woman is aborting as an act of revenge - it's absurd and insulting."
1740,notsarc,"And yet, for most pro-choice folk on these forums, this question really is meaningless. For, even when it is assumed by these folk that the embryo has rights, they nevertheless argue that abortion is still acceptable. Even you believe this Shooter."
1741,notsarc,Well he HAS admitted he can't prove his belief. I guess that posting here would admit his false dichotomies that it's either literal genesis or evolution are false and god knows the world will end when that happens. Super admitting he's wrong? Never going to happen.
1742,notsarc,Because it will encourage teens to engage in riskier behavior. Abstinence until marriage is still the best way.
1743,notsarc,But isn't that the problem? This creationist decided that science should be limited to his religion. He's afraid of flying.
1744,notsarc,"And like drugs, banning firearms would create another tax free black market, supplied by underground smuggling and manufacturing. Making a pistol with low chamber pressures, especially a semi or full auto firing from an open bolt, is no big deal to a competent machinist. Guns like the MC-10 are made mostly from stamped steel, simple to manufacture in a spare room. This all sounds like legislation of morality, proven to be impossible."
1745,notsarc,"Just like the Brady Campaign. Often when trying to paint concealed carry holders as dangerous individuals, most instances they cite either never had a concealed carry permit to begin with, or the matters of the case were instances that lacked mens-rea and weren't crimes to begin with."
1746,notsarc,"Yes, it's very subjective. I was using evil as an example that was incorrectly used on the website. Even though evil is subjective, you can still be evil. (you can do evil to take away your goodness, but the only way to make yourself colder is by removing your heat, not adding ""cold"")"
1747,notsarc,"Nonsense, societies change over time, therefore they evolve. Only biological populations evolve through natural selection and the theory of evolution only applies to biological populations, but the term ""evolution"" applies to other things too."
1748,notsarc,"But Miller is with Jesus (and by extension, you): he says that God exists and that Christianity is true. Or, if you insist that he's against you, you're left with this conundrum: You call Miller and theistic evolutionists incorrect, and he calls you and anti-evolutionists incorrect; why is your position any more logical than his?Regarding your citation about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts, you omit the remainder of the paragraph. Shame on you, marc, for your quote mine. Miller clearly continues with ""philosophical pronouncements"" that many atheists do not forward. Over the following three paragraphs, he examines a single philosophical insinuation -- not a plethora of them -- and then moves beyond ""atheistic philosophical pronouncements."""
1749,notsarc,"Because specific species of horses only exist at certain periods in the geological record. Every so often, a new species that looks very, very similar, but with some distinct characteristics appears where the previous one use to in the geological record. Also, off the one of the coasts of either Ireland or England, there are sheer cliffs. In these cliffs you are able to see evolutionary development of shellfish for basically a billion years as you go from the top to the bottom. "
1750,notsarc,"Well, Satan was invented to explain why there is evil in the world.. the dualism. He was adopted by the Hebrews under the influence of Persia. However, in the Jewish religion, Satan is not this incredilbly evil being out to corrupt souls, but rather just an angel (who had no free will), whose job it was to provide for bad choices so that people may choose GOOD ,and thus live more sanctified lives by their own actions."
1751,notsarc,"How about getting the government out of marriage entirely? That is the goal of the libertarians, and maybe the liberals. No standards would be redefined if that happened, and gays would get their right to marry."
1752,notsarc,They can if they're Catholics since Evolution is accepted doctrine now in the Church.
1753,notsarc,"First of all, it's not a precedent. this is the seventh or eighth state where a higher court has found anti-gay discrimination in marriage unconstitutional. Secondly, when so many rulings go in this direction, it can hardly be called ""lawlessness"". It's a call for lawful, constitutional interpretation of statutes.It takes extraordinary intellectual dishonesty to pretend there is some ""agenda"" at work. These decisions are the consequence of two things: our long history of rationally applying those silly words about equality that folks smarter than this generation of politicians put in the Constitution AND a long-term correction of the misunderstandings of what homosexuality IS and what its consequences are.I know you don't personally believe it, but there is nothing wrong with us."
1754,notsarc,"Usually, but most of this has been quoted out of context by creationists and answered so often that it is an old story. Besides, as I mentioned, Feduccia has just published a detailed study on the embryology of bird digits. It supports his view, of course. I don't have a problem with that and it is certainly an issue worth study. My days of ornithology and embryology were long ago.Also, since those papers were published there have been several more feathered dinosaurs and primative birds discovered. Things are moving fast right now. Jeff Polling also has some information about the Ruben et al. article.But the ""bird hip/lizard hip"" bit is pure nonsense that demonstrates profound ignorance or intentional deceit. The correct information is so easy to find. That sort of conduct certainly casts a bad light on creationism."
1755,notsarc,"The article continues to comment that this mechanism serves as a mechanism tailored for evolution? Irrespective of its origins, somehow, life utilizes evolution FOR evolution.
 
 B. Convergence
 As seen in the docking simulation, the solutions all converg"
1756,notsarc,I see what she was saying now. When she said it it sounded like the man had no opinion at all.
1757,notsarc,"first of all, the claim is that random changes in molecules do not produce bodiliy structures. Proteins are molecules and are thus not what I was referring to. Second, there are no new enzymes or new proteins produced by any mutations...and not only that but none of those mutations have been shown to be random. So for all the billions of bodily structures in the world, ToE cannot account for even ONE of them."
1758,notsarc,"It seems to be the reason for crafting this new, individual right against the States. Since the original purpose of the Second Amendment doesn't appear to be needed, there is a new use that is protected."
1759,notsarc,"But it is based on history. There is plenty of history showing that women had illegal abortions. Or, if their families had money. went to Costa Rica or Britain to have a legal one in those countries.Women died or had severe medical emergencies due to illegal abortions. Doctors and nurses were prosecuted for providing these services."
1760,notsarc,"I see the similarity with the original scripture, in which Jesus was recognizing the authority of both God and Caesar in the world. However, Jesus was talking about the political power in the world. Jesus called the academics of his day, vipers and hypocrits, because they pretended to be holy but were evil. He called the wisest of men fools, because they did not believe in God. Also, as I stated before, truth should be the ultimate goal. I do not fear science. I do not see any truth that science may happen to reveal as a threat to faith. Why? Because God is Truth. Jesus said, ""And the truth shall set you free""!!! "
1761,notsarc,"Really Brady. It is widely recognized that Mr. Heston gave away a very promising film career in order to take such an unpopular stand at that time. In fact he worked very little in films after that. I think the above statement was a political one, an anti-gun one, without much fact to back it up.I don't think a man of such principle changes his mind when all he actually work to accomplish comes to pass. But you can push your poison just as far as you want to. You have a first Amendment right to do so. Mr. Heston would have wanted it that way!"
1762,notsarc,Just because it doesn't make it into press doesn't mean that normal self-defense doesn't occur and is illegal.
1763,notsarc,"For me, this is like the idea that the speed of light was once very fast and has now slowed down. Both ideas indirectly call god a liar. This is bad. If all of our experiments show the Earth is 4.5 billion years old, then that is how old it is. If the Bible says something different, then either God meant Genesis for peoples past and now uses scientists to explain things better (though I am uncomfortable with this idea as many scientists are atheists), or our puny minds, compared with God's, haven't yet worked out how Genesis and an old Earth tie together."
1764,notsarc,But your new language would be meaningless. The definition of a circle or a square does not vary from language to language. Mathematical definitions are not matters of opinion but quite precise descriptions so that all mathematicians will understand what is meant when the term is used. The words may change but the meaning doesn't. Math is not opinion. It is not my opinion that a triangle has three angles. That is a matter of definition.Apparently Habbit doesn't understand that substituting the words of another language does not change the concept. That sort of argument is basically ignorant XXXX.
1765,notsarc,"And that is meaningless babble. Evolution is a process that has been observed whether you like it or not. It is not a moral statement nor is it a statement of faith. It does not deal with government, laws or culture. Whining about it won't change it."
1766,notsarc,"I think they are doing it out of fear. They see the moral decline in America and they have latched onto the GLBT Community as their scapegoat. Since it's no longer PC To attack African-Americans for their obvious differences, it's not PC to go after other religions (especially Judaism - not that it actually stops pure hate groups from doing it) they have decided that attacking a group of people which are sexually different should be the way to go.I mean, their religion tells them that premarital sex is bad and wrong. Even though there is a multi-billion dollar industry based around HETEROSEXUAL sex, they actually depend on that money too much to bite the hand that feeds them. Insted, they attack a group that has not legal rights to marriage let alone little legal standing as far as individual rights. It's easier that way."
1767,notsarc,"Huh? With a 26"" barrel the .50 is good out to 2100 yards. With the 29 or 36 that increases to 2500, but the world record sniper shot was made with a .50 BMG and it was 2657 (1.51 miles)."
1768,notsarc,If the woman wants one than yes to all three.
1769,notsarc,Nope. Not the parts that are taught in high school. The conjecture is mostly at the molecular level these days.
1770,notsarc,"Do some research. People collect functional tanks and aircraft. Did you ever hear of the Confederate Air Force? They restore and fly military aircraft. As for tanks, there are many web sites that promote collecting tanks and other military vehicles. And people shoot laws rockets. They just do not shoot live HE rounds. It is a little expensive."
1771,notsarc,Obviously that is the case. We cannot simply say that a certain God exists and have it be so.
1772,notsarc,"Well, the type of atheism you are talking about here requires faith.If you say ""I know there is no god,"" this statement requires faith.You have not observed anything that would lead you to reason or deduce that there must not be a god. The presence of religion has nothing to do with this faith and it's not a religion, just a gross assumption with no ""proof."""
1773,notsarc,"Yes, I mean the couple who was wrongly accused of being Russian spies in the 50's and then exicuted. This was stupid for at least two reasons. One, they weren't spies. Back about 5 years ago, they had a family member come out and say that they testified wrongly against them. Second, the whole idea of the Russian threat was some paronoid fantasy by this one guy named McCarthy who was an idiot and a big fraidy cat. Because of his loonicy, too many people lost jobs wrongfully (and lives) and made an entire nation of scared citizens even more frightened.Besides, the Russians were never really a threat to us in the first place. They were more of a threat to themselves."
1774,notsarc,"The mechanism, according to biologists, is a random mutation that would usually not reproduce much, but reproduces when the rest of the bacteria are removed. The mutation becomes a standard gene at this point."
1775,notsarc,"Actually science is not sure whether expansion will continue indefineitely, whether it will stop and remain stable, or whether it will collapse. Last I heard collapse was not given good odds. Hovind is probably behind the curve here."
1776,notsarc,"Actually, Galileo wasn't killed. He was sentenced to house arrest. And his sin was in declaring that the earth moved since the Bible states that the earth doesn't move."
1777,notsarc,"And we know this how? You complain about the 90% figure being erroneous and then make an unsupported statement like this?Furthermore, if Mexico is making an earnest attempt to smash the cartels and we're financing it in part, wouldn't we want to help reduce the weapons traffic flowing south into the cartel's arsenals?"
1778,notsarc,I know we know a great deal but even if it is from a taxonomy point of view I still don't think there is conclusive evidence.
1779,notsarc,"I love Jesus
 John the Beloved is my most favorite writer throughout time
 
 If you think I have a problem with a follower of Jesus your wrong. I have a problem with the Christians"
1780,notsarc,"I'd agree..... faith is a ""leap in the dark"" (or whatever similiar phrase we care to use) on at least some level, there is always an element of the intangible there.I know Christians who have described there faith to me in such terms before.. sounds quite reasonable to me."
1781,notsarc,"An independant perspective doesn't make it a good thing. Politicians that propose anti-gun legislation don't have to live in the real world with those of us that the bill will affect, they shouldn't be allowed to propose it."
1782,notsarc,"--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I do not believe that the supreme court adressed the the problem of convicted fellons having the death penelty reduced to life in prison and going on to kill in prison."
1783,notsarc,"Here is what fascinates me about the judgmental criticism you offer of my opinion. In typical fashion you make claims which you don't support at all. Here is my post below, point out WITH EVIDENCE!!! what I am distorting in any way; especially that which I hold dear. In other words, write a cogent and rational post which makes sense when applied to the quoted post it intends to attack. emoticonXDonno"
1784,notsarc,"Funny. That's not what the articles say. All of the articles pretty much concentrate on the research as significant in support of the dinosaur/bird link. If you had been paying attention, you would have been aware that it had been previously established through other tests that protein remnants were present. Thus, the amazement that protein remnants so old had been found had already passed."
1785,notsarc,"of course. But not as scientific theory. Some people believe that the Holocaust didn't happen, you want to teach that as a scientific theory?"
1786,notsarc,"Well, I wasn't an fortunate as you. It took me a few years to see through the fairy tale of evolution and see that God was the only true creator. However, that is a whole 'nother topic."
1787,notsarc,"You're obviously an Obama supporter, they're the only people who wouldn't be upset at his abusive tactics of threatening lawsuits against anyone that runs unfavorable ads against him, thus showing that he doesn't support the First Amendment."
1788,notsarc,"So far as I am aware, nobody but you believes this to be the case."
1789,notsarc,"So please tell me who would be the actual criminals if the Government violated the Supreme Law of the Land and made all guns illegal?But I do thank you for proving that there are people out there who want them all, despite The Bill of Rights says and what the Supreme Court proved was the correct meaning!"
1790,notsarc,"Ah, you've engaged in the grammarian nitpick function of debate. Sad, but predictable. 
 
 Obviously, I was discussing the entire article, which is making that argument. It is generally bad form to quote an entire post when it reaches such length."
1791,notsarc,"Some theists are willing to ignore such discussions. It has nothing to do with whether God exists. As previously stated, this thread topic is meaningless because of our inequality to God and the illogicalness of the question. We do not and will never understand Him totally."
1792,notsarc,"Actually our school's Gay-Straight Aliance held a day of silence to show respect for gays who have had to live in silence. They asked the teachers to respect the people in their day of silence and not force them to talk. I think most teachers didn't force students to talk. Unfortunately, some just spoke in sign language for fun and said they were doing it as part of the day of silence."
1793,notsarc,"And why do you say that in ancient times that atheists were people who believed in 'God(s), but didn't belive in intervention) (a.k.a Deists).
 
 Why do you think that people who didn't believe in god exist?"
1794,notsarc,"In some cases yes, in others no. If the mutation gives a huge advantage, then there will be a decline in the size of the gene pool for a while (eg when the Australian rabbit population was reduced form 500 million to 100 million by myxomatosis, the gene pool strunk as a result and the genetic ""mutation"" that gave increased resistance spread throughout the whole population as a result). Most of the time though single mutations do not have such a huge advantage and so genetic variation is maintained."
1795,notsarc,"So you refuse to engage in an informal debate on the topic, but you all of a sudden are itchin' for a formal debate? How about you make the challenge?"
1796,notsarc,"A perfect example of why Christian fundamentalismm and evolution can't co-exist. If God is wrong, then the Bible is wrong. Evolution contradicts the Bible, plain and simple."
1797,notsarc,It doesn't matter whether it is religous or not. The odds of anyboy being fired over such a thing are slim to none. Morning after pills can not possibly make up eough of any given pharmacys revenue to make it worth the expense of replacing a skilled employee.
1798,notsarc,"Well, many have argued that if you don't except a literal Genesis, you're damned. Perhaps not in this particular thread, but the arguments are esentially the same. I believe that the theological implications of that position are fair game for discussing the validity of creationism."
1799,notsarc,"Most of them happening in the inner cities of Illinois, New York and California - states where the restricted access of firearms is supposedly designed to keep acts like these from happening.   Who's the real traitor in this case; Obama for not passing your gun control package? Or the black guys that feel the need to kill their fellow black men for whatever reason motivates them?"
1800,notsarc,In a situation where you have to pick who dies there is no winner. You default to some standard which can be the highest chance of living (save the life you can). Lucky this rarely happens...if ever (normally both will die in this kind of scenario).
1801,notsarc,"I see, when you say ""I'm not an expert"" do you mean you aren't a climate scientist or do you mean you don't have the scientific knowledge to discuss this?"
1802,notsarc,Butwhat of the fetus/babies that were wanted by daddy but not by mummy what does termination stop then?
1803,notsarc,"So were the officers on the front lines of the Mumbai massacre. But they didn't shoot back, they hid like cowards. They let people get killed for no good reason."
1804,notsarc,"Yeah, back in the Late 60, because The Black Panther Party was publicly armed, and had publicly advocated Offing the Pigs, our law makers granted the police the law that said it was illegal for anyone to transport any firearm within Ohio. They did it with the understanding that they would not abuse the privilege that was granted for their protection. Well, 40 years went by, and new officers seeing this law on the books started enforcing it. After all, why not, It is the law, and their is no excuse for the law! Period!   Well, Ohioans for Concealed Carry and a bunch of others, decided enough was enough, and contacted Ohio law makers who took it off the books because it wasn't being used, as agreed upon!"
1805,notsarc,"It is the desire of your heart that is the sin. If you do not feel that having an abortion was wrong then asking God for forgiveness is doing nothing but insulting him. All you say is that ""I know it is wrong but I'd rather do it my way"". Not a wise stance if you believe in God."
1806,notsarc,"As I pointed out, you don't understand what either evolution or natural selection are. Evolution is a change in the relative frequencies in inheritable characteristics in a population over generations. If the number of long haired animals became more frequent in the population, then evolution has occurred. Natural selection may (or may not) be the mechanism that caused the change."
1807,notsarc,"And this is merely another piece of evidence that Sport's a XXXXX.   How about the simplistic explanation that people and other organisms have inhabitated the area since the Dinosaurs died?   If you bothered to read your own article:   Really if this is another one of your fresh organic sample = age of decades of time capsule because they were both on top of the ground, you're officially delusional.   Except the picture of the human remains are clearly NOT fossilized"
1808,notsarc,yeah but they also might not care! i mean they might have a gun themselves!
1809,notsarc,"Bad guy vs bad guy is included to be sure but remember, 43% of the people in the study had no criminal record."
1810,notsarc,"And as their populations grew over thousands of years, civilizations seperate out and independent nations form, laws are set up, and some prosper while others wallow in poverty, how long do you think it will take until people begin to kill each other on your peaceful planets? Nice dream, but real life does not work like that."
1811,notsarc,"Would make, that is. However, not all members of the population are able to breed.   Should we make this a thread for posting examples of natural selection? That might be fun.   An example: rats are often a problem. The solution? Introduce rat poison.   Unfortunately, some rats are immune to the poison. You should have guessed it- those rats reproduce, and the others don't (as much).   Another: elephants use their tusks on predators and for ritual purposes (attracting mates). Some elephants lack tusks or have shorter tusks.   However, when poachers kill the elephants with the biggest tusks, the elephants with smaller tusks (or no tusks) reproduce more."
1812,notsarc,"Yes, you are missing something. How come age doesn't start at conception? How come when babies are born they aren't 9 months old instead of, well, seconds old."
1813,notsarc,"But again, that requires a YEC to contradict their belief in the flood. As earlier stated, previous YECs have gone into the field, looked at the data and evidence and abandoned YEC as it makes absolutely no sense. YEC 'science' is not used in hydrocarbon production."
1814,notsarc,"No - but then the feral child illustration was intended to highlight the significance of human social 'DNA' to humans, not to imply that it can civilize any old species.   However, you raise a good point which I can turn to my advantage: let's replace the dogs in your reversed scenario with, say, chimps. Can they learn table manners and use silverware, learn to use the toilet or bathe themselves? Yes. I've seen a bonobo prepare a boil-in-the-bag meal. I consider my point concerning the role of social DNA in distinguishing human from animal pretty much made"
1815,notsarc,"That's not evolution. Life has evolved in the lab, many times."
1816,notsarc,NO I mean every word of what I type. If they institute these rules I will back off gay claim to marriage and accept that marriage is about children.   As long as they continue to let 70 and 80 year olds get married marriage is not about children and there is no reason to exclude gay people.   I would also add one more lisencing rule   8 No one may have children with out a marriage lisence.
1817,notsarc,"Then you are probably a bit older than I. My mother was 45 in 1963, the year I entered the Army. My mother will be 86 next month and we have a party planned with her older sister, nieces, grand nephews, grandchildren, and great grand children.   I am so sorry for your early loss. My father died at 73 from complications after a ""successful"" surgery. It was still difficult."
1818,notsarc,"Yes. The US Constitution is secularist, but it's not atheistic."
1819,notsarc,"And he's out!   By the way, why did you say ""strike III"" and not ""strike 3""?"
1820,notsarc,"Sucide? Isn't that a mental health issue? If you take a gun from a sucidal and depressed person, does that cure depression?   If it does that you have addressed the root cause of sucide.   If it does not than you really have not done anything to cure the fundamental cause of sucide."
1821,notsarc,"I have posted responses to Demon38's earlier post. I have offered DNA findings as evidence to begin with. It is not my evidence, but scientific evidence. That is the only evidence that I will provide in this discussion. I think there is ample evidence to cause scientists to rethink their theories, evidence that they do not want to accept because it puts certain hypothesis they have advanced in a poor light."
1822,notsarc,Nothing.... they both have to live with the shame of killing their baby.
1823,notsarc,Why not? Why shouldn't they be given at least closer to equal weight? The baby is going to be as real and genuine of a person as the mother; the only difference is that the baby is a few years behind. You're talking about a difference of time.
1824,notsarc,"So suddenly, being supervised by not one, but two law-abiding qualified (in one case an instructor!) adults is not safe? Who administered the training and qualifications of the instructor? Who drew up the regulations which allowed this to happen? Who pays lip service to ""safety"" in the use of their deadly toys?   We constantly hear that only criminals with guns are a threat, and the law-abiding gun owner is a paragon of rational safe behaviour. This is all too obviously not so."
1825,notsarc,"You are correct, it was a typo.   It is now apparent to me the purpose of basically all your previous posts. So, I will build the causal linkage from my own words instead of adapting from yours, which are inevitably wrought with loopholes.   1. Any action that knowingly and significantly raises the chances of a person's untimely demise is cruel.   2. The act of abortion knowingly and significantly raises the chances of a person's untimely demise.   3. If there is any known chance of abortion at the time of conception, then it significantly raises the chances of a person's untimely demise.   4. Any known chance of abortion at the time of conception is cruel.   5. Abortion is cruel."
1826,notsarc,"I see you are on form today BradleyHarris, that is another very good post, and it certainly (for me at least) shed light on Nu Leaders line of reasoning.   The point on the second law of thermodynamics is interesting. By invoking it as supporting evidence it can be seen to justify the belief on one hand, but also work against it on the other. This also shows a certain expectation on the part of the observer- chances are this line of reasoning is quiet ""safe"" as we are unlikely (my opinion) to encounter sentient aliens for sometime."
1827,notsarc,And your point was demonstrated to be specious using your own source. To contain strawmen even as you claimed it to be a strawman.
1828,notsarc,"Very true, especially since when someone asks ""is there a God"" they are most likely really asking ""does the God in which I believe exist"""
1829,notsarc,Wrong and right.   Evolution is both a verified phenomenon and a biological Theory.
1830,notsarc,"My outburst was meant to show that even a seven year bombardment of religious propaganda can be ineffective if no reasons whatever are advanced for reaching the conclusions that the theists desire. Theology is a bogus ""study"" of infinite pretensions and of an unknowable ""reality"". Yet I wouldn't describe atheism as a religion: essentially it's a disbelief in the existence of God because there is no good reason for doing so and there are good reasons not to."
1831,notsarc,"so if for instance enough people think that to exterminate the Jews is good, then it has to be good? the rule of the mob rules right?"
1832,notsarc,Actually it uses thymine. Tyrosine is an amino acid.   I'm not sure but I'm sure that someone is.   But the glory of the internet doth provide:   http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives...4206.Bc.r.html
1833,notsarc,I wish you could put your hands on that poll as well. Until then I'll remain skeptical. Let's remember that Democrats and liberals hunt. Remove that group and what's left? Something less than 20% of Americans that own only handguns.
1834,notsarc,"You do have a problem with this person defending himself or you would not be attacking him. Fear made him do this. The fear was created in him by the buglers.   You want unarmed passengers to attack armed terrorists on airplanes, but you have a problem with a home owner killing buglers."
1835,notsarc,"Apparently not.   I live in Utah and every public school has a building on the grounds called the seminary.   In seminary class they teach of all things the book of Mormon.   A Mormon is basically a financial Christian with a whole other book of incredibly stupid poop in it.   These Mormons are as lost a people as you will ever find, totally immersed in a cult fantasy world.   So its not surprising."
1836,notsarc,"You mean Intelligent Design, and straight forward logical, rational, common sense arguments that require reason to move to the next step, instead of ideological consensus... huh? go figure... Proponents of ID usually don't argue religiosity or scripture, they let the empirical evidence prove it, funny... that is what true science has always done. Verify the obvious, not ignore it in favor of some mindless postulations [oddly] convenient to how someone wants to live their life; amazing how that works out..."
1837,notsarc,"Hello, unkerpaulie.   If the chimpanzee (or ancestral chimp) found itself in the savannah environment in which Homo erectus (skull H) lived, then, yes, H. erectus would be better able to survive than the chimp. On the other hand, if you put an individual erectus in the forest environment in which the chimp survived, probably the chimp would be better adapted."
1838,notsarc,"Well, then. They're not TROO christians. Just ask a certain poster on this board. When I told this certain poster that I have known several clergymen from several Christian denominations who accepted evolutionary theory, that's what he told me.   That certain poster and others would rather claim Newton, who was an arian, as a christian rather than clergymen who accept the divinity of Christ. Those clergy just understand both science and religion better."
1839,notsarc,"Misunderstanding or misrepresentation? Biologists and geneticists do not claim that DNA is isolated from the environment. We are well aware that the environment can cause mutations under many conditions (cosmic radiation, x-ray, etc.). What is denied is that mutations are environmentally directed - in other words, exposure to cosmic radiation will not cause a mutation that will make the organism resistant to cosmic radiation. The mutations will be random.   On the other hand, natural selection IS, by definition, the response of populations to their environment. The environment has been shown to have effects on DNA, i.e., the genome of the population."
1840,notsarc,"I think you are misinterpreting what I am saying. For example, we would still exist without a lung or a heart if that lung or heart were replaced by artificial lungs or hearts. Indeed, if you push things to the extreme case (and, granted, this is going into the science fiction realm but it proves a point), if we could artificially keep our functioning brains alive and functioning on their own (without a body), then ""we"" would still exist as long as the brain's function involved all the mental processes related to our mental existence. That existence would just be pretty dismal without any sensory inputs or freedom of motion (unless they were supplied artificially).   That is what I am heading at. What are we at our very core?   I don't see how you logically derive this conclusion from what I said. Can you elaborate?"
1841,notsarc,And that is different how? I told johnny to write that I'm infallible. Therefore the book that I told johnny to write proves I'm infallible. There is no difference.   You do realize that there are other religions out there? That science is constantly updating?   Your arguments have been nothing more then false dichotomies assuming there are only two choices despite history laughing in your face.
1842,notsarc,Does the sexual orientation of the would-be single parent even come up?
1843,notsarc,"In that case, your idea is already falsified, because there are too many intermediate fossils to count."
1844,notsarc,But we have an enumerated Constitutional RKBA. Apples to oranges.
1845,notsarc,"You are arguing from US law, I am arguing from Australian law. I think I needed to state this at the beginning.   I have not heard of a US court case where a woman sued a hospital for bringing her back to life 'against her will'. Though in America, anything is possible   The oath of a doctor is to save a life. A woman who OD'ed would need to be saved."
1846,notsarc,But just try and remove them from those that think we do and you will have a war on your hands. It's too bad we didn't become more like Canada is respect to gun ownership. A lot more people would be alive today and others not sitting in prison for crimes they commited.
1847,notsarc,But science classes are for teaching science and ID has not shown that it is science. There is no evidence and no research has been done yet. It has been around for more than a dozen years and we are still waiting for any actual research to be done.
1848,notsarc,You stand up for women..   I stand up for the child who has no choice   Who's being descrimatory here?
1849,notsarc,"But the embryo is a mere clump of flesh inside of a woman's body. Science proves it. It has no sign of intelligence, it is merely cells at this stage. Therefore, it cannot be referred to as another person, or neighbor, and is no where near comparable to a human. Choices that harm another should be illegal, but choices regarding your own personal liberty and freedom should be made by the individual. Not the government."
1850,notsarc,"While the current cannon was 'accepted' by the late second century, there were numerous other 'gospels' that existed by then, and were eliminated at the 4th century time frame. Most of those copies were destroyed, but some have been unearthed."
1851,notsarc,This is poor example. Focusing on saving lives over burying the dead doesn't do anything to trump personal autonomy.
1852,notsarc,"The difference, Eddie is simply this. If the Constitution needs to be changed, the founders instigated a means to do so. Said means is doubly hard as to make sure what is done, has been given much thought and study. The plan afoot today by the Gun Grabbers is to incrementally usurp the rights of free men, until, the fait accompli has been established. If the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, or any of the other rights guaranteed by the Constitution are to be abridged, they must ne done so by legal means, i.e. constitutional amendment."
1853,notsarc,"1) ""false impression by stating that a Christian Pastor believes that bigotry blocked Gay Marriage.""   2) ""Had the title said, pro-gay pastor believes bigotry blocked gay marriage""   The only difference here being that you would want to label him as ""pro-gay"" and exclude ""Christian"".   By the same token, should we remove ""Christian"" and replace it ""anti-gay"" from any pastor that speaks against homosexuality?   Naw. Of course not.   There is nothing dishonest about acknowledging he is a Christian.   His statements should make it clear that he is pro-gay.   Your dispute is pointless..."
1854,notsarc,"Theres a book my mom has called ""The trouble with Islam"" by some lady. I don't know her name, but it looks like it may bee a good book for you."
1855,notsarc,"That crime fighting tool senario you just described is REALLY REALLY spooky. They way our justice system works is: 1) crime is commited 2) suspects are considered 3) evidence against one suspect builds and is arrested 4) suspect is given a fair trial with all the evidence present to a judge and jurry.   In our system of justice, collection of evidence is PROHIBITED by the 4th Amendment without probable cause. There is no crime, thus no exuse to collect evidence. Citizens are also protected by giving any evidence against thier will by the 5th Amendment. This collected evidence will be used against suspects without thier permission. The crime fighting tool you just described violates 2 rights in one sweep. That is a very scary power given to police."
1856,notsarc,"I disagree, I need you to show me what part of reason is BASED on faith of a rational creator, based on evidence (includes things that are self-evident). Unless you want me to accept your claim on faith!!   -Mach"
1857,notsarc,But we weren't discussing either monkies or hell. One can only wonder at your thought processes that makes such irrelevant and disconnected thoughts pop up.
1858,notsarc,"You are missing the entire point (again). Why do you feel ashamed? Because you know that what you did is bad. I have heard from a great Australian war hero, one of our remaining ANZACs soliders (recently passed away I think) that we he stabbed the enemy soldier with the spike thing on the end of their gun (WWI era) and he saw him die that it was ""the worst feeling that a human can possibly endure"". He said that that image will haunt him for the rest of his life. He knows that he did something wrong, but it was a war, and unfortuantely that kind of thing will happen. You are way off the plot. But let us continue."
1859,notsarc,"So you would go with the unknowable argument?   Well then this is applicable to your response:   So now you have said that god is undefinable or often said ""supernatural"".   T:I believe in God   A:What is God?   T:I dont know.   Then my question to you would be that if you dont know what God is... then what is it that you believe in?"
1860,notsarc,"The question is: To what degree do wars cull out particular genes as opposed to ideas? Another thing to consider is not who is getting killed, but who is being born. Unless, something is done about the niche, it will just get filled again by whoever was decimated. Compare: Germans (hypothetically) settling in the Ukraine versus the US bombing of Hiroshima (which was not then settled by the US). Consistent genetic pressure is really key."
1861,notsarc,And this is merely another piece of evidence that Sport's a XXXXX.
1862,notsarc,"It's one thing for the pot to call the kettle black, but here the cast iron cauldron is calling the porcelain basin black."
1863,notsarc,Just because a man pays support doesn't mean he is part of the childs life.He has no obligation to do *fatherly* things with his child.Women pay child support BTW.
1864,notsarc,Which is precisely why the law must needs be silent when it comes to women choosing whether or not to continue their pregnancies.
1865,notsarc,"And what does it matter if they're in the army reserve, or a lawyer, a teacher, a doctor?"
1866,notsarc,"And like usual, you're wrong   How were those pictures you ordered from Fox? You know the civil war ones with the dinosaur prop for the TV show ""Freaky Links""? Did they cost a lot?"
1867,notsarc,"Logically incorrect. One can as many red balls as one likes, and still only have one green one."
1868,notsarc,"Well then, have at it. The theme of the day was weddings. Almost everything taught that day, except for this one story, was about heterosexual marriage. Go on, show us your argument against teaching kids about how this society organizes familes.   Your opposition to this, homo- or heterosexual, is so obviously contrived. School is there to help socialize children and instruct them in how to be good members of this society, AND YOU KNOW IT. The idea that you would prefer them to ignore discussions of family -- while you simultaneously assert that this society rests on the family and tradition -- is ludicrous.   Come on, jyoshu, you don't have to argue this one... we won't tell your supervisor."
1869,notsarc,Because it's unfair that us little people can also own guns.
1870,notsarc,"Well, I did not choose to be heterosexual, I was born heterosexual.   I can not see why it should be different for Gay people"
1871,notsarc,"this is totally false. the laws of logic being absolute does nothing to support a case for god. in fact, everything the bible tells us about god's nature indicates that god is illogical, unpredictable, unreliable and irreplicable. this is totally the opposite of logic"
1872,notsarc,That is the premise of my question. On what basis can one claim that the Constitution makes this arbitrary designation with respect to the death penalty? I simply don't see any rational argument for it.
1873,notsarc,"I believe that you will go to hell if you commit suicide. It does not say in the Bible that you will go to hell for lying. (Where is your reference?) You cannot be a Christian and be gay at the same time. That goes completely against scripture. You don't go to hell for masturbating! (Once again, reference please.)"
1874,notsarc,You know how those anti-gunners are?they just kinda get stuck in that same old revolving door.Can't come up with anything new so they rehash.
1875,notsarc,"He's not talking about the fossil Coelacanth, he's talking about the modern version of it. And you can assert all you want, without evidence, they're just that, assertions."

1877,notsarc,"Last time I checked, it was a debate about religion and evolution co-existing. Not a debate about Creationism vs. ""science"" and ""reality""."
1878,notsarc,That sounds like an honest answer. How did you feel about it at the time? How do you feel about it now? Just trying to educate myself more.   Huck
1879,notsarc,Why do you find it necessary to fit observations to Genesis?   or why it makes perfect sense to design creatures that resemble humans but have them evolve from things that look like apes? and so on?   Are you saying that mankind is the original goal of evolution?
1880,notsarc,"Thanks, Clive, you're a good sport. Of course I can't agree with the XXXXX part. Rash, unwise, unknowledgeable, maybe, but not fools."
1881,notsarc,But you don't like intellectual property and consign it to non-existence.
1882,notsarc,"Really? 'cuss what I always see with anti-choicers is that they seem to think that the pregnant woman is invisible. This means that all men and all fetuses have a right to life at all times, but women, for some unknown reason, seem to lose that right when they become pregnant. Weird."
1883,notsarc,"And you're quite naive if you think that emotional examples mean anything against the facts. The so-called ""Partial Birth"" Abortion is quite rare and usually only performed to save the mother's life, but now they're going to have to let the mother die because Dubya has banned this now thus the first step to going back to the ""good old days"" when women were nothing more than property. You're the sick one.   Also, with your resorting to such tactics shows that you are losing.   BTW, isn't putting ""Your god"" under your name somewhat sacrilegious by putting yourself above your god? I guess that I'll be seeing you in Hell."
1884,notsarc,The Christian community DOES have a split on the issue.   Not all Christians believe gays should be the target of Christian homophobic attacks and discriminatory legislative efforts.
1885,notsarc,What is your non-violent way of stopping a felon with a knife? A felon who at 30 has spent 10 years in prison and was raped by other prisoners?   I suspect you will do what most New Yorkers will do when they witness a crime: NOT GET INVOLVED!   I will stop carrying a pistol when life is rosy. What else do you do to protect yourself besides being concerned?
1886,notsarc,"Well, my daughter cut her chin (in the U.S.), which required some stitches. My wife arrived to the emergency room with my daughter around 6:30 PM. We did not come back home until after midnight."
1887,notsarc,"They have. Prey animals have their eyes to the sides of their heads which allows them to see in every direction, almost 360 degrees around. Predator animals have their both eyes facing forward."
1888,notsarc,"Sure,,,,I have more than a few that was purchased from a individual,,,,no registration,license,no paperwork.I hand him the money and he hands me the gun.All legal and absolutley no paper trail.   As far as guns purchased from a licensed dealer,all that is documented is the info for a background check,And by law that info must be destroyed within,I think 90 days.   Kind of puts a snag in the whole confiscation idea ,,ehhhh?"
1889,notsarc,"Because naturally the man should be responsible to pay for it... one way or another, to support it... and her in marraige, or provide child support, as provided in the law... he did the deed, and must be made to pay..   The idea is that if men are held responsible for abortions, then they will put on a condom instead of taking the chance,... and hence.. reduce the abortions or the need there of, and this would incourage them to marry."
1890,notsarc,Well if their reasoning hasn't sunk in by now   Anyways I'm pro-choice and pro-death penalty. I do believe in individual responsibility which is why I'm pro-choice for males as well.   What's your argument?
1891,notsarc,"But....but....I thought these weapons were used solely to kill large amounts of people? Can anyone explain to me why we have to ban ""assault weapons"" because they are only designed to mow people down like blades of grass, yet we need to issue the same ""assault weapons"" to our police for their safety?   If they are used solely to kill large amounts of people indiscriminately, why do our police need them, unless it's to kill large amounts of people indiscriminately?   How can you argue they ARE NOT needed, yet argue that they ARE needed?   Which is it? Please explain yet another instance of anti-gun ""doublespeak""."
1892,notsarc,Might be something to be said for that. Are there any studies that show possible causes of suicide?
1893,notsarc,So does this mean they have to get tougher on gun control or softer before the results go their way? That is the real question. My guess is that we are caught in the unhappy medium where going in either direction will be more successful than where we are now.
1894,notsarc,"It should, but between you me and the wall, you know it won't though."
1895,notsarc,I never said they would actually follow it all the time. I said that most would incorporate it (referring to a world morality). Just because they would accept it doesn't mean they would follow it. Maybe you should stop trying to tear down your little strawmen.
1896,notsarc,"Or maybe it was his reaction to the outcome of Heller vs. DC, which resulted in the lowest number of homicides since 1966. The facts aren't on your side, Brady.   This is probably the only thing Obama ever did politically that I agree with."
1897,notsarc,"Would you mind telling us just how he determined ALL maladaptive or inconsequential mutations in his test organism and just how he validated such measurements? To me as a biologist with quite a bit of microbiology under the belt it would seem to be impossible to do so! After all its very likely that a fairly large portion of the populutaion will have at least one mutation at at least one base pair location in the total sequence! Your claim would seem to be impossible, but perhaps there is a way he managed to do so."
1898,notsarc,"Political leaders should not oppose gay marriage at all. But if a political leader is going to stomp around proclaiming that he wants to ""defend traditional marriage"" and promote ""family values"" by denying others the right to marry, the voters will not be happy if that political leader is discovered to be cheating on his wife.   You seem to be suggesting that the arguments by political leaders in favor of ""traditional morality"" and ""family values"" are entirely meaningless and are just pandering to popular prejudices. That is just what the voters, I think, won't like about this.....that all the ""family values"" talk was nothing but political posturing to garner votes. Which it probably was."
1899,notsarc,"No kidding. What could POSSIBLY be more concrete? As far as I can tell, she has never publicly made a statement specifically about the DC gun ban but since, as you pointed out, she DID say that no functioning democracy should allow private ownership of guns, I have trouble believing that she thinks the private citizens of DC should be allowed to own guns, UNLESS what she is saying is that since we own guns, we should move toward a monarchy or perhapse some kind of dictatorship. She did not, as far as I know, voice her opinion regarding private gun ownership in a totalitarian system."
1900,notsarc,"Incorrectly by those who don't understand evolution. Talking about the evolutionist theories about the big bang is pretty mindless, since the big bang is cosmology. Whether or not there was or was not a big bang is irrelevant to evolutionary biology. Lumping other sciences under ""evolution"" is a method of creationists so that they can claim that they don't oppose ""science"" but only evolution. To be a creationist is to reject the last 400 years of science - cosmology, astronomy, astrophysics, nuclear physics, geology, paleontology, tectonics, biogeography, genetics, population genetics, and so on. You get the idea."
1901,notsarc,"Well, there are several problems with your post. 1) You misunderstand   the term 'THEORY' when applied to scientific theory's. A theory is   a model to try to explain the FACTS. WHen it comes to evolution, the   theory of evolution is a model to try to explain the observed fact that   evolution happens.   Second of all, Humans and modern apes share the same ancestor. From   a biological point of view, humans ARE apes that have a specialised brain.   The third problem is many religious people take much of the bible as allegorical. That means they are able to reconcilate such things as   scientific fact, (evolution, expanding universe, age of the universe, biology, geology and physics), and their belief in God."
1902,notsarc,"There is only one problem with your statement my friend, and it is a big one in my opinion. I'll fix it!   If the bill of rights isn't legally binding, then the declaring of a law to be unconstitutional would never happen.   There! It looks correct now!"
1903,notsarc,"So the scumbag judge or judge and jury did a tremendous miscarriage of justice then. But this is off the topic. Its Black on Black gun crime, not judicial activism."
1904,notsarc,"Just how do you suppose the government seeking permision would work in reality? And what exactly are you afraid of? It seems odd when people advocate blind trust for Joe Civilian, but then think that the government shouldn't be allowed to be armed. I think there must be a balance in trust given both ways."
1905,notsarc,"More like put on ""leave with pay"" aka ""taxpayer funded holiday"" while the woman is charged with ""assaulting a police officer"" to try and cover their misdeeds. At least that seems to be the usual tact in 21st century america."
1906,notsarc,"Well, that's your claim, anyway. Truth is that billions of theists accept evolutionary theory as is and reject the standard ID arguments."
1907,notsarc,"The real dishonesty is in pretending that this church doesn't believe in the Bible.   Just because they don't agree with YOUR interpretation of the bible doesn't mean they don't believe in the bible.   We could look at ""women's rights"" issues as well. The bible is quite explicit in how women should behave and what their role in society is.   They are NOT to have positions of authority over men. NO women teachers. Women are to learn in silence and subservience.   Can we declare that churches out there that don't hold to these draconian measures as ""not believing in the bible""?"
1908,notsarc,Not heard that before! made me laugh almost as much as your lettuce eating Tyrannosaur
1909,notsarc,"Apparently this is a petition opposing the pending resolution before the Illinois lawmakers that will deprive the rights given in the Constitutions. It is to encourage the lawmakers to vote against it. The lawmakers have not yet agreed to vote it down. Knowing the State of Illinois, I am predicting they will pay no attention to the commoners.   The only thing a glean out of this is that the common people have more sense than the lawmakers. But I've actually known that for a long time."
1910,notsarc,"http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/Area/isd/jones.asp   When Judge John Jones of Dover Pa. was considering evidence from persuasive evolutionists concerning what should be taught in schools, could it be that he ""hardly knew the field, and didn't have an answer"" that would fit the time constraints of his decision making? Did judge John Jones know what was going on in this country 100 years ago?   Why can't today's ID opposing evolutionists see the mistake religious people made 100 years ago, and be enlightened enough to be more open minded about trying to suppress ideas? Maybe because human nature doesn't improve over the generations - following the money always comes first."
1911,notsarc,Really? I never know why people can't objectively look at things. Where would this reduce ANY health care costs? From every study I've seen it will cost Americans more
1912,notsarc,"Actually, one could also cite the success of Chinese merchants all over the world, South Korean capitalists in the U.S. and quite a number of other non-Europeans around the world.   Do all of these groups hold values in common? Or, is there a distinct brand of Hindu capitalism as opposed to Chinese capitalism as opposed to South Korean capitalism? And, I'd better not slight the Japanese in this discussion.   I'm not sure I approve of Hayek's take on capitalism, though."

1914,notsarc,"And if the ""natural process of evolution"" is determined by humans in a university lab, many with an atheist worldview, that clash with something the Bible says, you and Kenneth Miller immediately toss the Bible out and accept what the humans say - no questions asked?"
1915,notsarc,"If anti-gunners can pass a law to make the private sale of guns require a background check at a gun store then they can do it for all private sales.   If it is illegal for private citizens to sell guns at a gun show, then what prevents them from simply walking out to the parking lot and concluding the sale there?"
1916,notsarc,"I believe organized religion increases ignorance and represses progress but I'll not infringe your right to believe what YOU want and attend whatever church YOU want. Placing arbitrary restraints on private behavior (or ideas or other's beliefs) based on personal religious beliefs flies in the face of everything this country stands for. And stop bringing up ANIMALS...animals are different from PEOPLE, even the bible got that right."
1917,notsarc,"Quite frankly, one absolute certainty in science regarding homosexuality is that being gay IS NOT a ""choice"".   It is my personal opinion that anybody who proclaims that it is a choice is clearly demonstrating a lack of any real knowledge on the issue of a scientific examination of homosexuality."
1918,notsarc,"The problem is that there is no test the staff can administer to determine love. They can't tell if someone is really a loved one, or just some freak off the street that gets off on looking at unconscious people. Restricting access to family members is not an inherently bad idea, but it must include in its definition of family same sex couples. And since the only way to guarantee that definition is legally, what we have here is one more reason why gays should be allowed to get married."

1920,notsarc,"So, because she's bigger, she can kill the fetus off? That is generally the idea the school yard bully has."
1921,notsarc,"I think you got it backwards Kelvin. You're the one that said you wouldn't let your children play with toy guns because you're afraid that your children wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a real gun and a toy gun. Blindone never advocated toy gun-control. On the contrary, Blindone was pointing out that toy guns don't harm children.   And if your children can't tell the difference between fantasy and reality how do you expect them to handle a gun responsibly? They might try to shoot the boogey man or their own shadow."
1922,notsarc,"This has everything to do with guns,how are these people suppose to protect   themselves?Since the police have been told to just let them go, crime will run   rampant, it will become THE place to go if you feel like duing a little robbery a little burglary,gosh wonder if they gotta let rapo's and killers runaway to.   Only 2000? I lived in George Wa. and the population was less than 2000,it was also just off I-90 and we had plenty of crime from people passing through not   necessarily from people who lived there."
1923,notsarc,oh sure there is. you would just have a lot of angry off people though.
1924,notsarc,"And do you include me in that analysis?   Perhaps you could link me to these threads so that we can see exactly how they 'open' I'm not saying I haven't seen put-downs of religion on this forum, but in my experience there's either personal history between the posters (the response is effectively continuing an on-going spat that transcends the thread), or the OP itself was laden with flame-bait."
1925,notsarc,Really? Do all your views depend on somebody else changing them for you?
1926,notsarc,"I know these statements are a bit hostile, but arrogant ignorance just ticks me off.   What makes you think you have the knowledge to post on a thread like this if you didn't know that the Buddha never even claimed to be God?"
1927,notsarc,"So, you accept Geology, and in turn accept the fact that the earth is around 4.56 billion years old (and not the literalist age given by fundies who worship the bible).   And yet you reject all of the discoveries of geology (the fossil record, etc.) that evolution explains perfectly. And, as Pandion said before, it stands alone and shows the fact that life has existed in other forms billions of years ago, and humans only appeared recently.   BTW, the ""fools"" that are denying the validity of Geology as a legitimate science are your fellow creationists.   As to the bible answering ""how did we get here"", it is as good and trustworthy at that as any other mythology of any other civilization. The bible is mostly a collection of myths, folklore, fairy-tales, and politically influenced propoganda."
1928,notsarc,"Be wary of names. 'junk' DNA is not rubbish ... it's called 'junk' because we don't know entirely what it is used for... But just look at all the blank spaces on this post. They are nothing, but they are keeping the words in order.   Evolutionaries are putting too much faith in names of words - such as human embryonic 'gill slits'   or   'transitional' fossil"
1929,notsarc,"Sounds like lots of arbitrary statements.   Your assuming things to be true, and attacking the person not the argument."

1931,notsarc,Cumbria shootings: gunman Derrick Bird kills 12 then shoots himself - Telegraph
1932,notsarc,"I suspect that you are thinking of birds. But early birds had fingered claws on those wings. It is generally true that no organ ever springs into existance completely developed where nothing existed before. The wings of bats, birds, and pterodactyls are merely the modified fore-limb of a tetrapod. There is evidence that insect wings may have arisen from some sort of thermal panel. And of course, size has considerable relevance to flight. Wingless spiders fly by spinning a loop of silk that is carried by the moving air. Very small insects require almost no wings to fly. What they do is more similar to a whale in water than a bird in air. If by chance, a small animal is upsized because of a competetive advantage, and the wings are too, then it becomes a larger flying animal."
1933,notsarc,"Plenty of instances of killings at courthouses to prove you wrong.   And let's not forget the biggest case of murder of innocent unarmed people in a gun-free zone. That's right, September 11th. Everybody but the terrorists were unarmed, everybody died. Can't get any worse than that."
1934,notsarc,"besides pain, there is a plethora of experiences that take place in a person's mind that cannot be yet detected by science. imagination, taste, dreams, art appreciation, etc. even though these things are real, they cannot be quantitatively described in physical terms, so they cannot be treated by science"
1935,notsarc,"Largely, out of date. To paraphrase myself from earlier, the differences between 'then' and 'now' are as follows:   Increased availability and proficiency of viable alternatives for self-defence.   Increased availability and improved variety/design of handguns.   Different type of 'gun crime' - it is now largely opportunistic.   Today's government need not fear almost any citizens militia, unless absolutely overwhelming.   Today's government is less in need of a (potential) extra army to defend against foreign assault.   I may have missed some..."

1938,notsarc,"How do you explain the change of appearance of the animals over time, as recorded by fossils?"
1939,notsarc,"""refuted?""   O'rly?   First they start off defining evolution as ""moleclues to man"" despite what evolution actually states. That further proves my point about strawman. They don't discuss what evolution actually is. Furthermore, the whole notion that increasing capacity and adaption is not increasing complexity is insane. If I take a simple structure, modify it to form something more complex, is that not a change in complexity? The whole idea that modifying DNA, changing it, removing and adding isn't actually changing anything is retarded.   And they are separating macro from micro. That's an invalid argument given that macro is nothing more then the aggregate of micro. A billion tiny changes makes a few large ones.   The second idiotic article cites Natural genetic engineering. Despite there being absolutely no evidence of this occuring anywhere."
1940,notsarc,"At what cost? How many civil rights are you willing to give up in the name of a few less murders each year? Are you perfectly willing to be stopped by the police on a block-by-block basis and forced to show identification and traveling papers, all the while the officers on location are pointing their guns right at your head, ready to blow you away at the first sign of a twitch or if you display even a hint of hesitation to comply?   How desperately do you crave a police state? How much do you favor a nationwide curfew where violators can be arrested by the police and held without legal counsel for an indefinite period of time? Do you favor the use of physical and mental torture to force convictions even from the innocent?"
1941,notsarc,"While I don't appreciate your tone, you are correct in that I misunderstood the premise of this thread.   The short answer is that I would have to be convinced that a soul exists and that a soul is injected at any point in the process of conception through labor. An unlikely situation given that I'm an agnostic.   Though I have said that I'm amendable to banning 3'rd trimester abortions as a compromise. Loosely related to having my mind changed."
1942,notsarc,"That, my friend, is where the wisdom of interpretation - makes sense of the data.   For exa.:   I really have no idea what the Federal GAO has for data, but, The wisdom of giving 850 Billion to a few bankers rather than the people who actually fuel the engine of this economy - eludes me.   We have a large and powerful machine, but who is driving? Very important IMHO."
1943,notsarc,Oh? And what do you consider yourself when it comes to gun rights? Are you moderate or fanatical? Would you actually declare yourself a fanatic or would you like to be known as a moderate?   I don't think any organization who wants to be taken seriously will declare themselves fanatical about their cause because that would take away from their credibility.

And at that time, this ignorant christian will be standing tall in his knowledge as you all regret everything you have ever believed in your lives."
1952,notsarc,"You are missing the point. Evolutionists say that certain animals in a population are GENETICALLY superior than others....and these genetic superiors are more successful breeders. Do you understand this concept? So when you say that more humans are born than reproduce, that's not particularly important because I submit those who go on to reproduce do so mostly because of choice or circumstance -- not because of their GENES. How can you possibly refute this?"
1953,notsarc,"I believe you are thinking of orders, not denominations. There is a big difference.   Strict and loony? Could you be a little more specific, because this statement sounds like it's coming out of complete ignorance.   You also seem to be making the assumption that all of the non-Catholic Christians are somehow very similar, which couldn't be further from the truth."
1954,notsarc,"I disagree. I've been in a loving, committed relationship for 25 years to the same person exclusively...how does this have a negative affect on you?"
1955,notsarc,"Well, I forgot to add one thing: a legal notice to the gov't about such behavior."
1956,notsarc,"It's not a reference to Carl Bogus. It's a reference to ""Quotes falsely attributed to Hilter, Sarah Brady, and Janet Reno"" on this page:   GunCite - Gun Control: Bogus gun control quotes"

1958,notsarc,No it's not. Perhaps because you don't understand much about evolutionary theory you have confused it with ID. ID is not science and has no evidence to support it.
1959,notsarc,Because Humphreys went out looking? How many should we allegedly find?
1960,notsarc,"Well either the police are going by documented reports, or they're just making up a BS number to give politicians something to bite on for furthering their agenda."
1961,notsarc,"So much for choice. Obama's little socialist minions want to use the tax system to collect healthcare premiums if you don't comply. After all, getting employers to collect income taxes before you even see your money has worked for these leeches in the past."
1962,notsarc,"Actually, the majority of my first post in this thread came from Robert H. Churchill's article who is an advocate of the individual rights interpretation."
1963,notsarc,"Just look at the dates on your sources: 1969, 1978, 1981, 1977, 1980, 1981, 1981, 1983, 1970. Your most recent source is 25 years old and that one is from a creationist source. You've got to be kidding me. I also notice that you claim to have had a private conversation with Andrew Ingersol in which you pointed out an error that he had made. I suspect that you are a liar or a thief. But of course! You are a creationist!   I also notice that you don't seem to have made an attempt to educate yourself by checking out the sources I gave you. Moreover, you still haven't presented any evidence for creation. You keep claiming that there is some. Why do you refuse to present it?"
1964,notsarc,"Maybe you'll have to clear up the difference between ""understanding"" and ""knowing."" I know what I think the difference is, but I need to know what you mean when you say ""I understand that there is definitely no god.""   Personally, I understand that we have no verification one way or another.   All I know is that I don't know one way or the other."
1965,notsarc,"No but his complete dependence on a media machine certainly takes away from the validity of his message. The models for climate change that Gore recites are strictly weather and do not look at global climate patterns and do not look at climate changes within history. The changes that are occuring now are within the limits of changes that have happened elsewhere in history. His information is just a ""part"" of the story. That is why he is incorrect."
1966,notsarc,"Your reason for believing this lies entirely within the Bible. I hardly consider a 1500 year old book ""making clear what he wants"". Particularly given that even among those who believe the book, they still can't agree on what God wants. And of course, that doesn't even beging to address the issue of all the other holy books which contradict the Christian Bible. You may personally believe that you know what God wants, but if so it's not because God has been clear about it."
1967,notsarc,You ask to debate a lot of issues at once. Do you believe in a literal Adam? Do you not think that the idea is completely connected to Jesus' ministry? If it weren't for sin - Jesus would need not have come.
1968,notsarc,"I learned a few things from the post. The author claimed ""most households don't have guns"". According to 1997 stats, 25% of ALL US adults owned firearms. If you assume that there are typically two adults per household, that means 50% of households have guns, so the statement is false.   On a personal note, someone tried to break into my brother's apartment shortly after he was married. He quickly opened the door, yelled ""freeze MFer or I'll blow your head off!"" while holding a short-barrelled shotgun and watched the perp #### himself. being half asleep and in possession of a slightly modified shotgun, my brother didn't call the cops to report this self-defensive use of a firearm."
1969,notsarc,I was about to take a sip of coffee when I read that! Would have lost the keyboard and monitor!!!
1970,notsarc,"You forgot the evolution of the motorcar, the evolution of Christianity, the evolution of the computer, the evolution of the trumpet, the evolution of...   The word evolution is used in everyday terms to mean change (normally for the better). Biological evolution, ie the theory of evolution, is unrelated to this everyday use of the term. ""Astronomical evolution"", just like ""Trumpet evolution"" has nothing to do with the theory of evolution. When you grasp this simple concept, you will have made your first step toward becoming knowledgable about the theory. At the moment, you are stuck on the start line boasting about the end of the race: you are a YEC supporter in other words."
1971,notsarc,"I'm not sure what the source of the bias would be. Do you mean that it is somehow prejudicial to link ID with creationism, because, somehow ID is scientific while creationism isn't? But that's just not true. In the Dover case the court concluded that ID isn't science any more than creationism is. In fact, it was clearly demonstrated that the motivation for ID is an effort to disguise the fact that it is nothing more than creationism without the mention of god. Basically, if you scratch an IDer, you get a creationist."
1972,notsarc,"You're right, I think he has made such comments. Sorry. I think he's wrong and went too far."
1973,notsarc,"Notice that nowhere here do you address the claims and evidence -- which the movie apparently lacks -- about the assertions of ""the expelled."" Trying to deflect attention from your inability to respond substantively won't fly with us; these guys are fudging the stories and sharing only selected pieces in a specific attempt to hide what really happened.   For what it's worth, I feel a hell of a lot more vulnerable as an atheist in my profession and location than IDers should feel in research and teaching academia."
1974,notsarc,"Actually, one can argue that it was a pagan institution long before it was a religious one."
1975,notsarc,"I think the OP said it pretty well. If an organism or cell can process information and then make decisions based on that information, that's intelligence."
1976,notsarc,"To say nothing of the possible threats to people's safety, if not actual acts of violence."
1977,notsarc,"Well, you have ""proved"" that the U.S. health insurance does not have any higher administrative cost than Medicare or the rest od the industrialized world. I think your problem is that you are convinced in your head that that in our healthcare there is no waste. And you are trying to square it with the obvious fact that our cost is the highest with nothing to show for it. You will have to admit that there is waste.   For example we have 5x as many MRI scanners than we need, we perform too many tests, we have high adminstrative cost. All these costs will be reduced. There will be fewer of these things PER INSURED. I do not know how many times I have to repeat this before you get it. The volume of this work PER INSURED will decrease. Do you understand that?"
1978,notsarc,Not this time. That was the previous attempt by the good people of Kansas.
1979,notsarc,I'm not surprised.   That's a typical response when someone calls your bluff.   Waxy
1980,notsarc,What about the pain and death inflicted upon the innocent women and girls forced to give birth? Have you no regard for them?
1981,notsarc,Give it a rest... what is evident here is more coffeehouse vasilation on your part... no foam.
1982,notsarc,"How is that silly? You do realize that the vast majority of firearms used in crimes are stolen no? And many of those are stolen from legal buyers. While it is a poor argument to argue that firearms should be banned for that primary reason, the underlying principle of control over supply is hardly silly. Unless you think that control over nuclear weapons is silly. Maybe you would. After all, you are Isly."
1983,notsarc,"They are both written in the bible. Neither of them have any evidence (apart from the bible) to support their existence. One of them has been proven to be utterly false. This naturally discredits the other, as they appear in the same publication by the same author. Why decide one is true when the other is clearly not, and neither have any other supporting evidence?"
1984,notsarc,"Hate to have to spoil things, but the rest of the world has really no interest at all in Kansas and its scholastic problems"
1985,notsarc,I believe once you have the rights granted persons that they may not be taking away because you are asleep or in a coma. Not unless of course it can be shown that higher brain activity has ceased and there is no reasonable expectation that it could return.
1986,notsarc,"What, specifically, are you witnessing? A baby being born? A prayer apparently being answered? A near miss? Mysterious coincidences that you interpret as being the work of God? Or do you see dead people rising up out of the grave? And people walking on water? And people turning water into wine and feeding a crowd with a small amount of food?   What kind of miracles are we talking about here?"
1987,notsarc,Oh really ? Parts of New Orleans were under water for more than 40 days before all the water receeded. Hasn't the plant life there replenished naturally in the wild ? Of course it has. The Earth is very able to repair itself in spite of modern mans sense of self importance. Here's some interesting photographic evidence of it. www.pbase.com/andrys/noah
1988,notsarc,"Well, at least accoreding to your ""because I say so"" belief. The woman, of course, don't need to pay attention to your desire to control her own body in bondage to your particular brand of outraged morality."
1989,notsarc,No. You've not understood what I said. I don't know how to make it perfectly clear to you...the reason the skin color vs. homosexuality analogy is not valid is that one is in 100% of the cases studied a result of uncontrollable genetic inheritance and the other is generally not.
1990,notsarc,Uh. No they didn't. Have you ever actually taken a biology course?
1991,notsarc,"Actually Electro, do you remember this thread?   Evidence for a flood? Oddly enough it took 20 pages before one of them even tried to argue against the reasons why the flood did not occur."
1992,notsarc,"And, what percentage is that? How was the poll conducted? Who conducted it? How was the determination made about who was a 'scientist'?"
1993,notsarc,"No it doesn't, as abortion WAS a legal option in this case.   This was not a legality issue, but an education issue."
1994,notsarc,"If your friend is hearing voices in her head to walk into traffic, she needs some psychiatric help."
1995,notsarc,"That's the thing, though; even a self-professed non-expert can perfectly well refute the ridiculous points supersport continually spouts. supersport, on the other hand, doesn't know any better."
1996,notsarc,Actually your posts are providing increasing evidence for just how simple folks can get.
1997,notsarc,"The 7 day creation I am referring to, not merely the possibility of divine creation through the Big bang etc"
1998,notsarc,"See my post above, Hi. marc ignores fundamentals of Miller's beliefs that he clearly spells out in trying to push his anti-Miller argument."
1999,notsarc,The biblical end has got to be near. This was a Doctor who spends all of his life saving people's lives.
2000,notsarc,Pregnancy is a health issue only for the woman. Your glib remark pretending to sympathy is insulting.
2001,notsarc,"To force women to have babys that they dont even want is even more ""preposterous""."
2002,notsarc,"I would kind of Like to Discuss your Fascinating use of Caps.   But seriously, your numbers are insane. Somewhere around 8000 gay couples have gotten married in the past couple of years, how in the world do you imagine that they've cost the state hundreds of thousands or millions each? You just made all that up, didn't you?"
2003,notsarc,"And why would I be anti Christianity when I am Christian?   Oh and by the way to who ever it was who said I don't believe in Jesus, or something to that extent, I never said anything to that extent, you just made up what you wanted and got mad about it. I believe in the teachings of Jesus. Yes I'm betting your asking me how I know about his teachings if I have never read the bible, My mom is someone who has re-read the bible like 6 or 7 times. So she's told me all about it, and what its supposed to teach us."
2004,notsarc,"Apart from the 'horizontally instead of vertically' part which I didn't understand - we're a hundred or so years too late, unfortunately. You might as well ask for an example of a book or website on cosmology that 'admits' the sun may just be a big ball of fire pushed by a scarab beetle, and not a nuclear furnace about which the earth orbits. There comes a point where continuing to seriously 'consider' a viewpoint becomes a waste of time and resources, because sufficient testing has been done and evidence recovered to discount it. We may one day encounter evidence that completely overturns the whole applecart, but so far it hasn't happened."
2005,notsarc,"But I don't hear you saying things like ""baseball is always harmful to the player"" or ""baseball is something no one should have to go through.""   You see, if pro-choicers only used the 'pregnancy-is-bad-if-forced argument, they might have a point, but they often don't add the last part.   Besides, no one ever forces a woman to get pregnant in the first place."
2006,notsarc,Obama overturns ban on overseas abortion funding   I thought abortion was the fix for bad or no family planning
2007,notsarc,Paranoia is so ugly. It's not OK to teach scientific theory but it is OK to tell them that mythology is fact?
2008,notsarc,"That should be, ""duh"".   I knew what you meant. A bit of humor is ok.   But I guess you don't have anything to say about the implications of this study."
2009,notsarc,"Just like no one is really ""for"" abortions, but they think that it's the woman's right to decide. Maybe that's like when congress gave the President the right to decide to go to war, even when they were supposed to declare war."
2010,notsarc,"I'd say no to the first part, and yes to the second. The ""information theory"" argument is something that gets brought up on forums alot, generally by people who don't know what information theory is, but I've never seen an ""official"" ID person claim it as a central argument.   The basic argument is that stuff, from the universe, to people, to eyeballs, to DNA, is too complex to have ""just happened"". Someone, (and they won't say God, cause their not trying to be religious here, oh no...) must have designed them."
2011,notsarc,"Because she, like every other political figurehead, thinks it's alright for her to carry a gun, but not anybody else.   If she DIDN'T support a ban on all firearms, then why did she say ""If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them -- Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in -- I would have done it."""

2013,notsarc,"Gary Ridgway, the serial murderer of some 60 or more women, possibly more."
2014,notsarc,"I believe abortion is murder and should be illegal. The only possible circumstance when an abortion should be an option is when the LIFE of both the mother and her unborn child is at risk. When both lives are going to be lost, it is better to save one as opposed to losing two. The holocaust on the unborn children of this country is something that we should be ashamed of as a country."
2015,notsarc,Yes.   (and this is to add stuff to make the post stick....)
2016,notsarc,"If a child comes in for an abortion and fears abuse from her parents then law enforcement should be notified. The only people protected by opposing notification laws are abusers and pedophiles. No elective, invasive medical proceedure should be performed on a child without the consent of a parent or judge.   If a minor is allowed to have an abortion without consent the parents/ guardians will have no idea whats been done to this child should complications arise, they wouldn't be able to give this information to a ER doctor or the childs pediatrition."
2017,notsarc,I disagree for the same reasons I have been giving all along. There may be some legislation that was passed that has kept corporations small (Anti-trust) but did it really benefit the society?
2018,notsarc,"If this is what passes for American healthcare, then your need for change is even more desperate. None of these ""treatments"" is available on the NHS."
2019,notsarc,"Cornell's writings consistently place him within the collective right camp. Even the arguments that are attributed to him which start this thread show his collective right desire.   His claim to neutrality in the individual/collective right debate is as disingenuous as his interpretations of the SCOTUS opinions in both Miller and Cruikshank:   Greatest Threat to Second Amendment?   Greatest Threat to Second Amendment?   Whether ?neutral? or not, Cornell has proven himself capable of distorting SCOTUS opinions when he does not find that they suit his collective right tastes."
2020,notsarc,You mean to tell me it's a falsehood??   I don't believe it.
2021,notsarc,"What would you know about fair and balanced?   I know a lot of truths about gays. Do you want me to start posting incessant threads pointing them all out?   And I am the moderator for the formal debate forum, not the entire board. Want to debate me on the benefits of gays on society vs Christianity?"
2022,notsarc,Are you sure? What about animals that had a combination of both long and short hair. Such fur would function more efficiently as insulation that either long or short alone.
2023,notsarc,"I think you present a good point, but part of the test here is to see how my post is reponded to; silence from certain people tells us things in inself.   So far it seems my initial estimation of the issue is about right- the idelogy being upheld helps some people ignore the effect the punitive policy imposes."
2024,notsarc,"GOD was proved not to exist many years ago details if you wish.   GOD was proved to exist many years ago details if you wish.   IRAQ was proven many years ago to be a justifiable war.\   IRAQ was proven many years ago to be a non-justifiable war.   And so it goes. Most such proofs are hot air, unsupported distrortions. Hovind is of course good at that particular game."
2025,notsarc,"Just another anti-gun Blogger.   I could go on, but doing so would boar the heck out of everyone, to include me!"
2026,notsarc,Are there truly laws of logic?   Where are they encoded?
2027,notsarc,These items do not have killing as their primary use.
2028,notsarc,"Well, given that your term is a fabrication of the creationist's mind, I suppose you're right. Evolutionists don't actually exist. Therefore you could assign whatever traits you wanted to them, including dishonesty. Evolutionist is a term designed to cast evolution as a faith based notion. The problem is there is no faith in evolution, faith is a belief in something with no proof. Evolution has proof. Therefore it cannot be a faith based idea. A typical creationist attack is to misrepresent their target by creating a strawman of it. They then declare it is wrong and by proxy, the actual theory wrong. It's fundementally weak, but inline with a belief that is scientifically unsound."
2029,notsarc,"Well, it depends on your definition of retarded I guess. The standards to get a drivers license are really not that high. Think of how dumb the average person is, and realize that 50% of people are dumber than that. Kinda makes you cringe.   And you wonder what has prevented me from being in an accident? Well, perhaps the fact that I am a concientious, defensive, and skilled driver who excercises caution while on the road. Maybe next time someone pulls out in front of me, I should just throw my hands in the air and scream ""take the wheel jesus!"" I am sure some magical being will fly down from heaven and save me from crashing. Yeah...sure."
2030,notsarc,"So would you care if abortion were outlawed. If so, what would be bad about allowing a view that places objective value in human life to be the basis for making law?"
2031,notsarc,"It's remarkable then, how much progress we've made. You may or may not approve of the theory, but it works very well at learning more about biology."
2032,notsarc,"Then there's that state thaht wants to remove the use of BC and AD from the calendar. I guess they'll change it to some neutral like plus and minus numbers just to stay with the rest of the world....or maybe 2005 will change to 133,956,373,278."
2033,notsarc,"Why not? You said yourself kalifornia was a ""trend setter"". It is alread the law in many states."
2034,notsarc,"You SERIOUSLY need to take a basic biology course so you can stop sticking your foot in your mouth   An egg is NOT larva, and larva is NOT a caterpillar, and a caterpillar is NOT a butterfly - much the same as a zygote is NOT a embryo, and a embryo is NOT a fetus, and a fetus is NOT a baby, and a baby is NOT an adult.   I challenge you to prove that a larva is exactly the same as a butterfly. If you can't even do something as simple as that, then you'll never understand the process/transformation of what a human has to go through, and THAT in and of itself should give you a clue as to how much in denial you are in, and how much you have to twist the truth around just to justify your version of events. Deal with it!"
2035,notsarc,"Why conception? When a mature ovum leaves the ovary, it has every potential of turning into a human being. How dare I stand idly by while that potential life is wasted, unfertilized? No; clearly, it is my duty to try to reach that ovum with my seed. God said to be fruitful and multiply, so I am just following God's will."
2036,notsarc,ABORTION IS NOT BAD.   That's all that needs to be said.
2037,notsarc,From your own link it is very clear the NRA DID NOT say that or publish that. Your clearly very wrong.
2038,notsarc,I'm not arguing that gun control will change the nature of men- though guns may make them more willing and confident to engage in crime. With guns criminals can do even more damage. Adding guns to crime is like adding gasoline to a fire- it makes an already existing problem worse. If you think that just as many people die from stabbing and beatings in other developed nations as people die from guns in the US then you need to do more research.
2039,notsarc,"And it doesn't stop there. Another of my favorites is how they loudly criticize radiometric dating (most commonly radiocarbon dating because they know no other kind) then shout from the rooftops that radiometric dating confirms the ""genuineness"" of ~2000 year old manuscripts..."
2040,notsarc,"I have no idea what this could possibly mean. It makes no sense, semantically or logically. It is so vague as a concept as to be worthless in terms of the pursuit of knowledge."
2041,notsarc,"No, actually they used the Bible as a basis for their morality. They then applied that morality to the design of a system of government that they wanted to create.   Maybe the majority of Americans are comfortable with the status quo WRT their morals. Who are you to tell them that they have to change for you?"
2042,notsarc,"No I do not say that the creation of energy and matter   did not coincide the creation of the laws that govern/regulate   them. What I say is that the laws are not the RESULTS of the   existence of energy, matter etc."
2043,notsarc,"But I would have been interested in hearing how you explained the above points. My post was a quick hack job, looked up in a few books that I have along with stuff that I remember from my reading. I may have made an error and would be interested in hearing about it. Maybe I can defend my point of view, maybe I can't.   If you put time and effort into a response, why delete it. Redundant posts happen. ss/ww won't pay attention anyway and maybe he would respond to you. He runs from me because he always seems to make himself look like a fool and he realizes it."
2044,notsarc,I know ... I know. I agree with you that it's sad more of those people couldn't or didn't take advantage of concealed carry to help prevent so many deaths. That needs to change along with education so more people can defend themselves.
2045,notsarc,"One shouldn't assume ignorance on the part of creationists. That is a mistake that too many evolutionists make.   In the real world, we have people willing to say things they already know isn't true. Why should creationists be any different? After all, they are people, too. But rather than accept that fact, evolutionists argue that creationists are ignorant of a subject when, in reality, they (creationists) were simply telling lies."
2046,notsarc,That sentence doesn't even make sense. Did it occur to you that you should actually think about what you are going to say and express actual ideas?
2047,notsarc,"When talking to a person professing Christianity, the Bible is binding. If the Bible advises that abortion is murder, then it is so regardless of what the secular systems of the day have to say about it.   When talking with one accepting the principles of Christianity, the premiere of those being that the Bible is binding, the existence of the soul is not up for debate.   The position of Bassman, I believe, would be that there is no legitimate right to terminate a pregnancy, especially from the stand-point of the Bible, which of course, is binding to those professing Christianity."
2048,notsarc,"If this is true, then it should cover the fetus since there is no difference between the fetus and the infant besides size and location. Every adult was once a teen, every teen was once a child, every child was once an infant and every infant was once a fetus."
2049,notsarc,More likely the criminal will shoot first rather than give the other chap a chance.   There is no real reason for the average citizen to need or have a hand-gun
2050,notsarc,"He was using it as an example. He was saying that if something in your life causes you to sin, get rid of it!   BTW, thanx for giving me the references to your verses! It is really annoying to have to search through the Bible to find verses that people quote without references."
2051,notsarc,"So we agree..... What I want to know is why the vocal homosexual 'lobby' insists on the term ""marriage?""   emclean, the sanctity of marriage would not be the only thing about marriage to be (harmed?) changed. The whole definition of marriage would change, too."
2052,notsarc,"Yes...if you ignore people, they eventually go away...except for me, of course."
2053,notsarc,"You did when you talked about someone loving objects, or a mokey, etc."
2054,notsarc,No. you're not making any sense. Where is symbiote? I got a horrible argument for him to dispell.
2055,notsarc,"Just because you don't have a handle on what civil rights are doesn't make the phrase arbitrary. It's a legal term, not a catch phrase. I'm not a lawyer, I couldn't track down the exact definition they use in Massachusetts, but rest assured they have one."
2056,notsarc,"You know 'my kind'? How very presumptuous on your part. Then you know individual choice is the issue, not enforced medical procedures. You didn't answer the question regarding pregnant women who intend to carry to term being required to have a sonogram."
2057,notsarc,"Actually, after the fact calculations on either side are just noise. Humans do exist and I suspect that all statements of probabilities are incorrect. Further, I don't think that coin flips are relevant and not even a very good analogy."
2058,notsarc,"The tactics pro-lifers use make the Nazis look like the little league. I mean, seriously. The reason we are dealing with terrorism is because women have the right to the abortion procedure. Wow. Please give me one way those two things relate to each other."
2059,notsarc,"The founding fathers were afraid to trust the common people with the right to vote. They didn't want mob rule and chaos.

'Property', in those days, also included slaves, of course, and half of the Founders were slave owners....The maintenance of power in the hands of the elite was further strengthened by who could vote. In 1787, there were about four million people living in the 13 original states. But only about four percent of them, it is estimated, could vote. Excluded were the one million slaves, the two million women, anyone under the age of 21, and all non-property owners.""   http://www.alternativesmagazine.com/22/lonsdale.html"
2060,notsarc,"Are you trying to make a point here? Or are you just spewing forth your hoplophobic tendencies because you're got nothing better to do?   One of the problems with school children is that it's become a crime to discipline them the way our parents were disciplined. There's no spankings, corner times, or sitting on a chair with a dunce cap, because that's all been labeled as abuse to emotional development. Instead we have counseling and the administration of powerful prescription drugs to kids who can barely read.   Kids are spoiled rotten and left unsupervised with TV shows and video games that glorify violence and murdering people for fun. Parents are stuck working two or more jobs just to make enough money for bills so they don't wind up on the streets.   We need massive reform. We gotta go back to how kids were raised in the 50s."
2061,notsarc,"Well, one person got it right...where in the constitution does it say something about health having to be protected?"
2062,notsarc,But you are smart enough to realize that the ban on gay marriage has nothing to do with it.
2063,notsarc,"putting words in my mouth again? i did not say christian, i said ""God"". Christian, Jewish, and Muslim all believe in the same ""God"".   - XXXXX.   i'll let Crim and Lurch respond to the others; lets not let me have all the fun."
2064,notsarc,And folks that refuse to see the legitimate ones put us all at risk. Touche.
2065,notsarc,Wrong and no one has ever called bone marrow an inner sanctum and I don't know what a baby's tabernacle might be.
2066,notsarc,"I may be a pro-gunner but what doe's that have to do with with gay rights?   Since I'm a pro- gunner I won't force my life style or views on you,if you don't force yours on me.Deal?   After all you seem to be the expert on gay rights."
2067,notsarc,Is there something wrong with choosing to have a cheese sandwich as opposed to peanut butter and jelly? Do you prefer actually having to make personal moral choices or do you need a rigid and inviolable instruction manual to run your life?
2068,notsarc,my my you are up on the current events. Thanks for shedding light on this for everyone here.
2069,notsarc,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahahahahahaha. The deliberately out-of-context quotes again that directly contradict the conclusions of the authors.
2070,notsarc,"And how is your think group any different, you all think alike just as gun owners all think alike. So stop calling the kettle black."
2071,notsarc,"I do not argue so much the quality of llife of an individual woman but more for the quality of life, indeed of having access to life itself, of the children of the woman involved, because in many situations the concern and nurturance of a mother may be the only thing keeping children alive, especially in poor, war-torn nations that do not enjoy the relative wealth of the United States."
2072,notsarc,College. They are normally studied for two years between the ages of 16 and 18 before going to uni.
2073,notsarc,"Tell that to CDC pathologists. Or just read this post.   ETA: Alternatively, let's look at the logic in this way: because the field of quantum mechanics is useless for helping me describe classical physical systems, quantum mechanics must be wrong. I think this illustrates the fallacy satisfactorily."
2074,notsarc,"Well, not completely, but yes, quite the same. However, this is irrelivent- she wasn't a person, because she was in a coma. Does that give me the right to kill her? Of course not!   What about fetuses born in comas? Can we kill them?   What about people in vegetative states? After all, they arn't perfect, so let's kill them!"
2075,notsarc,Don't expect your misrepresentations of the findings of those studies to sink in. I'm not that easily fooled.
2076,notsarc,"It is an acronym for 'Y'oung 'E'arth 'C'reationist. In other words... someone who believes that the earth is only 6,000 - 10,000 years old and was created in six days by a being known as God."
2077,notsarc,But didn't they tell you? They outsourced your job to me!
2078,notsarc,"I'll have to apologize here, SoC. I confused you with another poster who also used Christ in his handle. You didn't run from the topic because you weren't the OP of that thread. Sorry about that.   If you'd still like to approach that thread, I'll respond and provide the link, but all readers should be clear that my accusation that SoC scampered away was mistaken, and any willingness to address the arguments would be solely to SoC's credit."
2079,notsarc,"Some references please? In general, it seems that most climatologists agree that severe weather systems will occur more frequently with an increase in average global temperature. (ref:http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/061.htm#1434)"
2080,notsarc,You weren't referring to your home in your little story of helplessness.
2081,notsarc,"You pointed out someone that had 6 fingers.   I said that making a copy is not creating anything new, I never mentioned anything about reproduction."
2082,notsarc,"""One day you're going to realize that you're ""evangelizing"" and ""witnessing"" have pushed far more people away from religion then has brought them in.""   ""You're not telling people about God, you're guilting them and putting them down. You're drawing an imaginary line that separates ""us"" from ""them"", and you're cutting yourself off from other people. When Jesus ""evangelized"" (I believe with all my heart he would hate that word), he made honest friends, not with the purpose to ""convert"" them. He didn't hand them a track and scare them into being a Christian. No wonder people hate Christians, for God's sake I'm starting to hate Christians.""   Maybe you should follow your own advice...   jim:   Yes, God loves Saddam but He hates the way he is acting."
2083,notsarc,"Things like future proof of a young earth - evolution needs billons of years. Or proof of severe weather conditions that would destroy the evolutionary process. Life on earth dies completely if it gets out of a fairly narrow temperature range, any time during those billions of years."
2084,notsarc,"Microevolution has occured. Several times over and recorded in the lab and the natural world.   [quote] Give me one peer reviewed paper . Just one. Not the latest dogma from talk origins . 29 evidences for bs.[quote]   Huh. Guess you're wrong.   [quote]Talk Origins does your thinking not mine. Give me peer reviewed documents not the latest political/religious factions babblings. Of course they don't exist but how could they? [quote]   And how does that mean evolution is wrong and creation is correct?   You do realize that even if you somehow manage to prove evolution false (not likely), you are still miles from proving creation right?"
2085,notsarc,Please define complexity. Please define information. Both definitions should be relevant to biology.
2086,notsarc,"You twisted logic strikes again. I realise that if a group of you were to take your guns and rise up against the current administration, you would all be labelled terrorists. This is not evidence that I support the current regime. How you could twist it to seem so is beyond me.   If I were to state that you couldn't take on a fully grown polar bear with just a short pointy stick, would that mean I am supporting the oppressive rule of polar bears? I think you should sit down and carefully think out what you infer from other's arguments before you keep coming out with these ludicrous statements."
2087,notsarc,"The fear of God? What God? Only yours or any God? How about the fear of something greater than yourself? Would that be progress?   I'm not trying to inform you or anyone else of anything at this time. I posted thread originally to get reactions to it so that I could better judge whether those views were valid or not. As a side affect people may be influenced by the debates that happen here, but I am doing this for myself more than I am for anyone else. So don't think I'm trying to push anyone to believe anything, although I do wish for people to question their own views as a way to best understand what they believe in and why they believe it. Based on the way you posted here, it is my guess you are unwilling to do that in the case presented here."
2088,notsarc,Pretty much every experiment ever carried out in a petri-dish; take your pick Also the revisited peppered moth experiment I linked to earlier.
2089,notsarc,"They do not hate the concept, they merely reject it as being useful or necessary to explain the material universe. I mean come on what utility would a physics which incorporated miracles be? Nothing would be predictable and all utility would be lost. If you want all of science to be arbitrary and unreliable then all ya gotta do is inject miracles into the field.   For example what value is f=ma {except when the diety wills otherwise}.   Or e=mc2 (god willing)"
2090,notsarc,"No, there really aren't. As for Robertson, why do you think I said he was right (as in global warming is happening and we are largely responsible) by sheer luck?"
2091,notsarc,"The 2020 Global Food Outlook answers this as it says that a greater demand for vegetables will correspond with higher prices of vegetables in developing countries. Many articles acknowledge that starving people cannot afford much of any of the food for sale around them, and a greater demand for meat does not necesarily mean a decrease in demand for vegetables as populations grow globally. Since increasing meat consumption is irrational because it will not feed the poor and it will do even more damage to the environment, again, the solution proposed is to support the initiative for developing nations to become more self-sufficient in growing plant foods for themselves."
2092,notsarc,"Your stats aren't broken down into meaningful groups, so nothing is learned WRT Muslims."
2093,notsarc,"This is retarded. A species would be defined by the genome, not which organs work the way they are supposed to or not."
2094,notsarc,no base for calling it a human being? Other than the fact that a fetus is scientifical a human being. Seems you have no basis for saying I can't call a fetus a human being.
2095,notsarc,"and how do you know this......oh I see...you said ""I think""....but you don't really ""know"" what most Americans favor or don't favor...you just ""think"""
2096,notsarc,Bonus question:   (Can you spot the grammatical error within the quoted text?)
2097,notsarc,"Like the docking simulation, in development there is a pre-existing fitness landscape (the womb). Both processes converge on similar endpoints each time it is run, both process are biased to a few endpoints and both processes reach local optima (e.g. skin cells) after the process id complete.   http://mybroadband.co.za/vb/picture....pictureid=1857   Figure 1: Similarities between development and a docking simulation employing a memetic algorithm.   There are certainly many parallels between our own designed simulated docking runs and the development of life."
2098,notsarc,"Sure. The outcome of Heller vs DC and Florida Shall - Issue laws support that statement. According to Brady logic, the more helpless you are, the safer you are from criminals."
2099,notsarc,"Well right there, you used an oxymoron, ""Great"" and ""Evangelist"" got together about as well as Military Inteligence.   Secondly, as I stated before...you left too many other questions unanswered about the ""Preacher."""
2100,notsarc,It's evidence of EAM. Probably she comes from a large family. Her mother always had her hands full and was on her feet day and night.
2101,notsarc,Nobody should be forced to even have a sonagram. I think that you'll find reasonable pro-life and pro-abortion people believe that much.
2102,notsarc,And an even funnier thing is it won't affect his wallet at all.
2103,notsarc,"Sorry, but that's not in the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Try again."
2104,notsarc,Well if you just shoot someone and they die then they dont get their day in court so they dont get due process. The fifth says you cant lose your life without due process.
2105,notsarc,"Incorrect.   Evolution is not something that must be adhered to. It is a scientific theory. As such, if evidence was brought to light that evolutionary theory couldn't account for, then the theory would be altered or scrapped. It's really quite simple."
2106,notsarc,Not true Our laws were originally founded on the precepts of the 10 commandments........
2107,notsarc,"I am hardly a phyicist, but I am under the impression that there is at least some people who feel there is reason that there are 'uncaused causes'. I think that   the terms used are 'Vacuum flucuations', and 'virtual particles'. I am not aware   of any peer reviewed articles on it , but a popular press book is 'Achilles in the quantum world' by Richard Morris."
2108,notsarc,"Again, we never said that a human fetus was a different species."
2109,notsarc,"Hello there. The principle behind a pro-life Christian supporting the death penalty (I am one) is this: We are talking of innocent life. The death penalty is justified for a person who is guilty of commiting a crime against a society that has that law. The child never did anything wrong. I know of other beleivers who don't support the death penalty, so basically, it's an in-house debate."
2110,notsarc,"Actually, it's not. The big bang theory is also science.   What exactly do you think the big bang theory is? What evidence do you think supports it? What evidence is there against it? why do you disagree? What is your education in cosmology - in other words, why is your disagreement rational?"
2111,notsarc,Your wrong. Airplanes and courthouses are gun free zones but these places never have massacres.
2112,notsarc,No proof anyone ever went from gay orientation to straight orientation.
2113,notsarc,Actually they do. Whether or not you think they should is another matter entirely. Did you not notice where the article came from? From a paper in India. I also found articles on the same subject from papers all over the country as well as in other countries such as Romania.   Save your snobbery for someone else.
2114,notsarc,"So the intent hiding behind abortion laws all along was to keep women in the gutter. There was not any legititamte concern for the unborn fetus. It was all about how they could keep women down. Tell me then, would someone who supports a ban on partial birth abortion do so simply because they want to repress women?"
2115,notsarc,"You are getting to a more complicated area where ""mental existence"" no longer matters. I've explained earlier that it isn't exactly the same as ""self defense"" so I don't think a similiar response is needed. Furthermore, you are saying mental existence is not solely the thing that gives you value but rather it depends on outside influences and chance.   At some point it just seems like the stance on abortion is that the woman is more important no matter what. This is why I claim some will rank humans above other humans...a dangerous precedent which we have tried before."
2116,notsarc,And yet you have no problem with this law Galileo?
2117,notsarc,"Again with the common sense, but that is another issue alltogether. You're arguement that the brain is a fundamental unit of life is just plain wrong, considering the majority of all organisms don't have one. Bacteria, Protists, Plants, Fungi, and some animals are all without brains. Brains are required for motion and fast response to immediate changes in environment, for example a falling rock. Brains cluster nerves so that appropriate action can be taken. Some brains are amazingly simple while others like our own are immensly complex.   Your arguements all show a general lack of study in biology and my common sense is appalled by yours. I am reminded of Bill Maher who once said about the intelligent design debate: ""Because you don't have to teach both sides of an arguement when one side is retarded."""
2118,notsarc,So you have a scumbag democrat screeching hate speech and we are supposed to believe its true! Get real baby even you don't believe this unless you have donated a vital organ associated with reasoning.
2119,notsarc,"Gun control maintains its racist roots even in this day and age. What other reason would there be for Form 4473 to ask applicants what their race is? What is the importance of knowing if somebody's white, black or mexican when they're buying a gun?"
2120,notsarc,"Because when something passes every experiment thrown at it and when something fits observation better than anything else, then it's as near as damnit fact. We can get pedantic over this if you want, but the conclusion that reaches is that there are no facts."
2121,notsarc,"Problem is, you think requiring a woman not to kill someone is ""treating them as breeding animals"". Kind of an odd thought."
2122,notsarc,"Well, I don't believe in evolution. I believe in things for which I have no evidence. And while it is true that everyone has bias, using correct science and the process of peer review works to eliminate. Not all is perfect, and people are people, but overall the system works. Not a lot of bad science gets through. In the case of ""creation science"" we know that there is no science involved. Only talk that sounds scientific. There is no hypothesis, prediction or testing. Only ad hoc stories constructed of selected bits of evidence to support the foregone conclusion."
2123,notsarc,"You're thinking is right on, sinjin.   Although it's kinda hush-hush, it has been determined (especially in the more charismatic churches) that when one ""goes further"" in religion the other feels alienated and problems/troubles that probably would have never risen in their relationship oozes out. A new circle of friends emerge which make the one that is &#8220;left behind&#8221; feel closed out and closed off. Arguments then seem to erupt daily and most of it over who is doing the &#8220;right thing&#8221; according to that religion, followed all too often by divorce."
2124,notsarc,The attacker is usually armed in spite of gun control laws. All they do is disarm the law abiding. Not to mention the lack of enforcement on criminals.
2125,notsarc,"Actually it couldn't be any worse then it is right now. More people historically have died at the hands of religious wars then non-religion. Religion has been used to push extreme political viewpoints, selfishness, racism, destruction of whole cultures, hatred, and ignorance. Wow that's something for you to be proud of eh grizzly6626? Through religion, televangelists have become pimps where cash is more important than integrity. While I haven't seen any atheists with bombs strapped to themselves, we've all see plenty of religious fools blowing themselves up each and every day. And of course we all know how peaceful and charitable The Spanish Inquisition was. I guess it's true, when it comes to religion IGNORANCE is bliss...   BTW - you forgot to mention that hitler was a devout catholic.   Yeah, like I said before, it couldn't be any worse then it is right now"
2126,notsarc,"Just so you know, the majority of Japanese cars sold in the US are also assembled in the US and thus provide Americans with thousands of jobs at these plants."
2127,notsarc,What in the Hell does evolution have to do with people doing bad things? I am a believer in creation by God and have never heard such drivel. BOY-HOWDY!!!
2128,notsarc,And science helped Stenger write his book. How can the same subject make a stronger case for both of two completely opposing viewpoints?   another
2129,notsarc,"Really! Then I assume that you have read Darwin - at least On the Origin of Species. Otherwise you are babbling. Please cite specific passages from Darwin's books where he made ""morals and ethics"" a joke. Please also do the same for the works of Dawkins. Your assertion presumes that you have read the works of both men."
2130,notsarc,"So you're admitting openly that what is a normal occurrence within the human species is offensive to you. That you find repulsive the very intimacy expressed by your own parents that led to your own existence. Do you see how that innate bitterness against the normal and right feelings that have led to the healthy continuation of the human race is ultimately anti-humanity? Why do you hate the normal propagation of our species Matt? Can't you see that if you were given the power to recreate the world in your image, then the world would cease to exist within one generation? No matter how pro-gay you are, how can you be so anti life in good conscience?"
2131,notsarc,"Why is it when Creo's don't believe something, Evo's always think because they have studies or what have you that we Creo's have to accept it as proof. I mean you don't accept anything as proof from Creo's. If Creo's did some carbon testing and did it accurately and got some anomaly's, you'd still reject it. I didn't lie not even by ignorance. I just don't believe it's true, but I take it I'm not allowed my beliefs . What fact has disproved my worldview, my worldview is intact as it ever has been?"
2132,notsarc,You got it. People make mistakes. Finally you see that scientists are just as human as religious people.
2133,notsarc,"Basic law 101: You can drive by 15 1/2 with A LICENSED ADULT OVER 25 IN THE CAR. Not 18 or 21, but 25 so it isn't a matter of potential peers watching each other. And your opening post referred to 14 year olds or above, as it shows below."
2134,notsarc,"Why didn't they ""fire"" and ""bar"" him in the sixties?"
2135,notsarc,Simple. The big government people will tell you that it's in everybody's best interest. The criminals will just kill you without debate.
2136,notsarc,That is amazing.   I find it crazy that this baby is much younger and smaller and far less developed than many of the babies that are aborted. Abortion is murder.
2137,notsarc,"How do you know none of the ""children"" were actually gang members engaged in illegal activity, and that fact was simply excluded because it wasn't considered newsworthy?"
2138,notsarc,"Rahm Emanuel for one. He seems to sum up the message very well.   And then there's Carolyn McCarthy who actually introduced the bill that, if passed into law, would cancel your Second Amendment rights just because your name is on the no fly list.   Just two names, perhaps, but they're the names of people in a very powerful and dangerous position, capable of making very bad things happen."
2139,notsarc,And you think this a good thing? It just shows the weak cowardly position of the creationist.
2140,notsarc,"So sorry, Anastasia...that's a horrible thing to face. And now, using that excuse? What!   If justice was swift for the guilty then he would not have escaped only to do it again. Some criminals never change, and via your testimony, only live to do it again.   There are some who need to be put to death.   Your situation made me shudder, Anastasia. But, I am glad you didn't let it (revenge) effect you to the point of taking his life yourself.   If it would have been my father, those many years ago, I cannot say that I would have waited, nor would have accepted that lame excuse of retardation. I could very well be in prison myself."
2141,notsarc,"Let's not confuse our readers. supersport is not saying it's evolution; he's saying that ""evolutionists"" say that it's evolution. It should be clear now to the readers that scientists recognized perfectly well that this is an example of plasticity."
2142,notsarc,"Catholics have a different belief. The goal is to always save both mother and child. If the fetus dies during the attempt to save both, then that's what happens. For instance, with an ectopic pregnancy, the goal isn't to kill he fetus, the goal is to save both mother and fetus."
2143,notsarc,"And that's when her career and popularity took a nosedive.   Now that she's no longer playing the activist, she's becoming popular again."
2144,notsarc,"Well, that just struck a chord with me. People of both sides say, We got the facts! The facts support our side! but it isn't about the facts but how we react to them."
2145,notsarc,"Damn, your links sure show a lack of knowledge. Do you have any sources that aren't ignorant as all heck?   While Hoyle came up with the term 'the big bang', he was mocking it. Hoyle was a proponent of the Steady State concept of the universe, which he held on to long after it was disproved by empirical evidence.   FFS, if you are going to use a source, have one that at least has the history of the theory right?   Yes, the estimated age of the universe changed over time. We got increasingly more sophisticated ways to measure it. In the last 30 years, the age estimate has not significantly changed, but the +/- has narrowed drastically. Do try to use a source that isn't over 30 years old."
2146,notsarc,"Banning abortion is a tool with which to punish women you deem promiscuous or immoral and recreate through a police state a mythical golden age of christian virtue, got you.   The rest is just a cover story in the same way biblical creationists who want their religion brought into the school system advocate ""intelligent design"".   They call it ""lying for baby Jesus""."
2147,notsarc,"Only when it is anti-intellecutal relgion, such as those YEC's.   Most relgiions are much more reasonable."
2148,notsarc,"""The Civil War was fought to establish the principle that each person owns his own body - a principle that the pro-life crowd is trying to destroy.""   Each owns his own body? Are you talking about the woman or the child in the womb?"
2149,notsarc,"No, I'm saying it's OK because abortion is legal in this country. I was just pointing out that it's also legal to execute a convicted killer, and it's fine and dandy to declare wars where many people will die. ""Thall shalt not kill, unless there is a war"".   Legally there is a difference. But let's just toss that out for a second. The end result is exactly the same. Eyes fogged over no longer care whether it was fun or self defense.   It's only time it's your call, is when it's suicide."
2150,notsarc,"Yes, because its THEIR decision, its THEIR stomachs, and its THEIR lives. I agree that some decisions do need to be made with parental consent, but not this one.   Irrelevant. How does purchasing a house have to do with abortion?   Ok, so what if the kid wants to have the baby and the adults want to get rid of it? What if the adults want her to have the baby and the kid wants to get rid of it? You would force the kid to have a child (that doesn't seem responsible at all), or you would force the kid to abort her child (thereby taking away her son or daughter). Both of those decisions don't sound very consitent or responsible. The decision is best left up to the person that is pregnant, regardless of their age."
2151,notsarc,"http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CD/CD011.html   Radiocarbon dating has been repeatedly tested, demonstrating its accuracy. It is calibrated by tree-ring data, which gives a nearly exact calendar for more than 11,000 years back. It has also been tested on items for which the age is known through historical records, such as parts of the Dead Sea scrolls and some wood from an Egyptian tomb (MNSU n.d.; Watson 2001). Multiple samples from a single object have been dated independently, yielding consistent results. Radiocarbon dating is also concordant with other dating techniques (e.g., Bard et al. 1990)."
2152,notsarc,"If we were created in God's image, then it would make sense that equally our emotions are a reflection of God's emotions. That our emotions are imperfect versions of his.   Of course I would personally say that when man invented god, they felt the need to give him human characteristics in order to make their invention more understandable. And to assist in the oppression of others by the ever-present threat of an 'angry god who will smite you'. An 'ambivalent god who is above that sort of thing' just isn't as good at convincing people that whatever you say is right."

When women kill their tots they are locked up/ and branded with a criminal record vs the female who callously kills durning the fetal stage.(Double standard?)   I have a couple friends, who have aborted more than once, because they didn't want to lose their girly figure(trivial). I find it eerie and disturbion....."
2156,notsarc,"No they don't. We didn't have a tyrannical society back in the 1830s when without a doubt personal autonomy didn't exist for some. The thing is, you don't have absolute personal autonomy now either. And it still doesn't answer my question about where the right came from, you just said there had to be one."
2157,notsarc,Just because it is human doesn't mean it's a human being. I'm not sure what grade you're in but that's basic biology 101. Your ears are human. Your ears are NOT human beings.

2164,notsarc,"This was pretty much my understanding of how natural selection was viewed before Darwin.   Nonetheless, I think that my point still stands. Darwin proposed that natural selection is responsible for the diversification of species. This pre-Darwin concept denies this. My understanding is that anti-evolutionists refused to accept that natural selection could have led to the diversification of species. Until recently, when they realized that evolutionary theory could help out in their how-many-animals-could-fit-on-the-ark dilemma; now they suddenly take an idea from evolutionary science and propose that suddenly all the present species could ""micro-evolve"" from a few ancestral ""kinds"" on the ark."
2165,notsarc,"If logic was invented by man that would mean that when people did not exist neither did logic. That does not sound logical to me. Most people believe there is life eleswhere in the universe (I'm not saying I do but I just want to illustrate a point). If logic was invented by man does that mean aliens elsewhere in the universe do not have logic to guide them?   Just a question.   ""In Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.""

2166,notsarc,"The quality of life ethic is far different from sactity/dignity of life ethic. A quality of life ethic carried out to its logical conclusions does not promote a pro-life society. Instead, there would be genocide against the handicapped, elderly, and people who people of power have deemed life unworthy of life. The problem with this ethic is that it is centered in arbritrary people deciding arbritarily which person passes the ""quality of life"" test."
2167,notsarc,"Well, you will find claims amoung this group that 'If Jews understood their own scriptures, they would accept Jesus as their Lord and Savior', and ""Christians are fullfilled Jews""."
2168,notsarc,"Except it's not. It's perfectly acceptable to morally disagree with drinking and smoking (and encourage others not to do it) and still believe others should have the freedom to choose for themselves.   chloe,"
2169,notsarc,"Oh, he doesn't want abortion, huh? If you take the Old Testament to be true, you just lied here.   Let's look, shall we?"
2170,notsarc,"Why do people on the pro-gun side continuously try to oversimplify the issue? No one is really arguing that there would be zero murder without guns. The question is would there be less murders without guns. In developed nations with stricter gun laws there are less murders. At any rate, I don't think you can draw such conclusions based on one incident."
2171,notsarc,"And where, pray tell are you pulling THIS strawman from?"
2172,notsarc,"and thus a reason to support balanced reporting.   true, there are indisputable facts. say 3000 died.   but the interpretation of the facts are subjected to bias. the 3000 deserved to die as collaborators vs the 3000 were innocent and did not deserve to die."
2173,notsarc,"This claim might be true, but do you have any citations about Carl Burgh's fraudulent claims? (ps I note you don't tell everyone else to go look up a book! It's nice to feel special)   I know of this site   http://home.austarnet.com.au/stear/carl_baugh_page.htm   which makes the claim, but I'd be interested to learn more about this alleged fraud"
2174,notsarc,"I'm afraid you're wrong, as I created you in my universe, and implanted in you a belief that you were a god. It lead you to make statements about the truth of your own beliefs, which I'm afraid are just self-beliefs with no real evidence.   Sorry."
2175,notsarc,"And I would like to know why that is. I asked the question in post #2 and got no answer. Are laypersons lacking in intelligence so much that it's hopeless for them to be on the same communication level with scientists? Since they share the same society, put their pants on one leg at a time in the same way, eat, sleep, and share economic processes in comparable ways, it seems to me it would be beneficial for them and laypersons both to understand each other when they use identical terms. (like the word, theory)"
2176,notsarc,"You know that what you call ""immoralism"" is my life. Why do you hate me so much that you would be willing to deny my the happiness that you take forgranted and as your due? You don't even know me yet you are willing to defame me just because I am different from you. I don't understand how I am running over you by living my life openly and wanting the same thing as you the right to consider whom I choose to be my family. If you have an opinion about gay rights thats fine. If you want to deny me the same rights, as you take for granted, because of your opinion and beliefs though laws then that is bigotry."
2177,notsarc,"Well, ya know, if you actually, oh I don't know, VISITED THE SITE, you'd see that the ""friendlyatheist.com"" is a blog-like page (and not the one that is actually giving the info on the evolutionary migration of humanity) and it gave a link to the actual website that we are talking about (the second link I gave): http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/journey/   But then, maybe we're expecting a little too much from a creationist."
2178,notsarc,Where were the French on D-Day and the Normandy Invasion when Hitler was burglering their Nation? I don't recall history mentioning a Frenchman around but the Americans were saving their rears once again...
2179,notsarc,"Somehow I don't think a high percentage of Ham's ""facts"" are facts."
2180,notsarc,"So then the law is flawed because criminals could just as easily get their hands on select firearms, ban or no ban. You've just admitted that the bill did nothing and thus there's no justification for it to be reinstated."
2181,notsarc,"Actually, no, that is not what I said. I said:   What you quoted is what Answers in Genesis said. Please do not be dishonest and tell others that I said this as I did not."
2182,notsarc,"So it's the blog's fault that Miller sided with the creationists. Right-o, marc. (I suspect you haven't even read the blog entry in question; I'd be surprised if you've read more than a paragraph of PZ's blog.. ever.)"
2183,notsarc,I know it's almost as silly as thinking gay marriage will undermine heterosexual marriage.
2184,notsarc,"Notice the double-standard here? The homosexual lobby accuses us of harassment, yet they are willing to provide names and addresses of people who oppose their agenda. I can't wait to see the backlash from this one."
2185,notsarc,"The quad 50 full automatic anti-aircraft gun is designed to oscillate on it's mount. This is so that the bullets will come out in a pattern. This pattern along with tracer rounds helps the shooter guide the blizzard of bullets at the aircraft. Even this only works at low altitudes. Modern planes typically fly at ~30K feet. That's more than 5 miles high! A perfect bullet, or one that is fired in a vaccum with an initial velocity of 2800 fps will only go ~25k feet before gravity alone will have reduced it's velocity to 0 fps. The odds of hitting something that is moving at ~900 fps at any distance with a bullet traveling at ~2800fps are slim to none. That is why anti-aircraft guns are full auto, not a semiauto or anything that a citizen has access to legally."
2186,notsarc,"I don't have the time nor the funding to put this in video form like Harris and Dawkins. I don't think many, if any, Christians really do - satire about atheism isn't a strong Christian practice, not nearly as strong as atheist satire about Christianity, it seems. Maybe that's what made Poe's Law so notable in the beginning of this thread."
2187,notsarc,"Actually, not at all true. The organisms of the Cambrian look little like modern animals. It is only the major phyla that are recognized by the derived characteristics. For example, the cordates first arise in the early Cambrian, along with primitive inverebrates. You can safely say that no animal living today looks much like any living then. For example, there were no amphibians, no reptiles, no insects, no birds, and of course, no mammals.   Your shotgun approach isn't actually worth answering in any detail. It isn't even your work."
2188,notsarc,"No, I think that he's right on target. The drug dealers that are caught here in Michigan usually get caught with weed AND more hardcore drugs. Theyy're ""full service"" dealers. Weed is a gateway drug, you know."
2189,notsarc,But wouldn't it make it more likely that a gun dealer that was involved in gun trafficking would be audited and caught by the ATF? If there are less FFLs then the ATF has more time to monitor and inspect each gun dealer.
2190,notsarc,"Just to contribute, I'm pro-gun, have had training in the proper use and laws in my area, and have owned weapons for more than 30 years."
2191,notsarc,"A slimey claim you cannot support as usual. In developed Nations, the U.S. is far down the list as has been posted on this very board at least 5 times. Those 'other' Nations also have far more crime and violent crime than the U.S."
2192,notsarc,I think if Islamic fundamentalism shows us nothing else it's that...
2193,notsarc,"Well said.   With this religion, the gap is very wide between the ""average guy"" and ""authority"", because their clergy is more involved in politics than the clergy of Christianity, or the Creator himself. It fits with more Democrats being evolutionists, and more Democrats favoring bigger domestic government."
2194,notsarc,"So what we have here is a lie, based on a distortion, which is itself a fallback position from a fallback position from a fallback position from an evidence-free made-up graph about the magnetic age of the earth. And creationists say the truth is constant..."
2195,notsarc,"Well, the first part is true but I'm not sure I understand what you are saying in the second part. Science does not claim that intelligent design is false because science lacks the tools to examine the concept. ID is just another unsupported assertion outside the domain of science (and logic for that matter). ID has reached the stage of unsupported assertion without evidence. Science has better explanations."
2196,notsarc,And my interpretation of my writing is that I didn't mean that. Who has more authority?
2197,notsarc,"yeah, this is clearly the best thread on these forums in probably the past year....give us some more pics"
2198,notsarc,And that didn't have a thing to do with my point.
2199,notsarc,"I'm not aware that the police used violence in arresting any of the people discussed in this case. Besides, I'm not discussing personal morality here, I'm discussing what should be legal, and what is practical in a society where not everyone shares the same moral views. Government is there to apply limits to what is permitted, based on the will of the people."
2200,notsarc,"But the civil war wasn't fought for slavery. If you will recall the average northern soldier wasn't too fond of blacks, and that is not only sugar coating it, but saying it in the nicest terms possible. The civil war was fought to keep the union in tact. Border states still kept their slaves for obvious reasons, the intactness of the union trumped any moral principal. Besides, that wasn't true even in practice. Black soldiers were paid less, had less equipment, had less medical care and were given the worst jobs possible. Hardly created equal. It took some time before they could even fight. Your argument is a load of garbage to someone who actually has knownledge about the civil war.   I won't even go into the reconstruction period and how your so called principal didn't even exist."
2201,notsarc,"Oh, we don't have to - sorry, I wasn't clear enough there. What I'm trying to do is correct your misapprehensions concerning common descent. You said this:"
2202,notsarc,"Well then this doesn't answer my question.   If you have 10 doctors for 100 people (this is just an example) and only 50 of them have health insurance and each doctor gets paid $100 a year then your health care per capita is $10 ([10doctors x $100]/100 people). If you change it to 100 people with health insurance you now have $10 per capita as well because you population did not change. Health care costs are shown per capita and not per person insured: Per Capita Health Expenditures by Country, 2007 &amp;mdash; Infoplease.com   So again, if you go from $6,000 per capita per that website given above to say Switzerland levels at $4,100 per capita then where did that money come from?"
2203,notsarc,"http://www.dcagenda.com/2010/02/08/m...asure-in-poll/   Keep in mind that this is an opinion poll, so take it for what its worth, but it seems to indicate that the people of DC wanted to vote on this issue."

2205,notsarc,"23,000 firearms were handed in when the UK had its gun ban. According to your logic those people that handed in their firearms can still be prosecuted because they took possession of a firearm prior to the ban. I don't think so."
2206,notsarc,"Do you want something other than peppered moths, bacteria developing resistance to antibiotics, Darwin's finches, and the other species of the Galapagos?   Maybe biologists are not allowed to do tests on animals that will kill many of them. This reminds me of Kent Hovind's reward for evidence of evolution: impossible to fulfill."

2210,notsarc,"maybe, but see, that does not match the materialist universe?"
2211,notsarc,"Humm. More guns, more Concealed Carry and Violent Crime and Murder is down to it's lowest levels since they started to record it. So how can these studies be credible or considered in anyway correct."
2212,notsarc,"What's your point? Of course they will be bound by Heller just as the courts are bound by Roe v. Wade. That point wasn't in dispute. As long as you're talking about 19th Century Second Amendment case law, I like The State v. Buzzard (1842)."
2213,notsarc,"I'm thinking this is the section of the Iowa Constitution the media will be talking about next:   Unlike California, amendments in Iowa must pass the legislature first (simple majority) before going to the voters. While I know little about the Iowa legislature, this seems a no brainer in a populace vote, considering previous votes and more current polls on this subject in Iowa. As a rule I lend polls very little credence, but DOMA passed by a wide majority in 1998. I doubt things have changed enough to cover the gap, a lot of traditional values and religious folks in Iowa."

2215,notsarc,"I think the only valid reason for owning a gun is because you want to. Every person (with some exceptions) has the right to keep and bear arms, why you do it is your own business. Giving specific reasons for gun ownership is the top of a slippery slope towards banning certain firearms.   While I have specific reasons for owning specific guns, to include hunting, I own some of my guns for no other reason than they are fun to shoot.   A humorus side note: I own one gun strictly for fishing, sounds odd but its common practice (at least in Alaska) to shoot large Halibut before bringing them aboard."
2216,notsarc,"Because I don't feel like copying and pasting articles into a forum when they can be easily accessed online. But for a quick summary: The CCR-5 gene mutation is present in about 15% of caucasians, with 1% having the homogeneous version. These 1% are completely immune. The heterogeneous people possess some immunity."
2217,notsarc,"Fossils are evidence, not theory. They can be used in the construction of any theory, including creationism. Whether this is 'just' or not, is another issue. I point this out as many seem confused about evidence, and think that it just points to something without interpretation"
2218,notsarc,"Actually, qualified biologists know no such thing. In fact, I've never known one who would agree with that assertion. Can you give us some peer reviewed references to support your assertion?"
2219,notsarc,"Yes, it's very subjective. I was using evil as an example that was incorrectly used on the website. Even though evil is subjective, you can still be evil. (you can do evil to take away your goodness, but the only way to make yourself colder is by removing your heat, not adding ""cold"")   No, but there is proof that it's that way, which can be seen through a combination of personal experience and the experiences of others.   The classic example about seeing that the Earth is round is that of the horizon. Why do ships appear to sink as they approach it?"
2220,notsarc,You think open carrying of loaded handguns in public will become fashionable in CA?   I think if anyone took to this they'd find themselves asked to leave establishments routinely.
2221,notsarc,"How curious that not everyone can admit that this kind of treatment is wrong. How interesting that another issue comes up instead of addressing the blatant, in-your-face kind of mistreatment of an individual making a private, personal decision.   Like many decisions in life, this is one that is difficult to come to. It doesn't mean it's a wrong one. It's hard because your options are so very serious."
2222,notsarc,"No Steve, I realise that there are hetersexuals who practice that filthy pastime of anal sex and other sex acts that the human body is not designed to do. Heterosexuals have no more business doing these things then homosexuals.   Do you realise Steve that E Coli bacteria inhabit the rectum and are in feces? Do you know how sick and E Coli infection can make you? Sodomy is akin to having sex in raw sewage."

2228,notsarc,"And it also took an amendment to give the slaves rights, not a judge."
2229,notsarc,"They aren't afraid of that. That a government agency would actually be financially competitive is ridiculous.   The only way it could compete for customers would be by running at an enormous loss or legislating away competition. That's what people are ""afraid"" of, not some idiotic speculation that government is great at business."
2230,notsarc,Either a gross misunderstanding or a gross misrepresentation of evolutionary theory.

Likewise, if my life is in danger, then I'm not really too worried about my lack of accountability to the person choosing to ENDANGER it; and I'm really sure if he's willling to commit armed murder then he's not too worried about misdemeanor gun-laws.   Psht, it's amazing how stupid, naive and arrogant these anti-gun XXXXXX are.   It's easy to get cute when someone ELSE'S life is on the line, but it's just plain evil to use the guns of the state, to take away someone ELSE'S guns and expose them to danger-- and particularly cowardly and hyopcrticial while cringing behind a safe neighborhood and lifestyle, while hiding from potential danger-- than shamelessly attacking those who simply fight BACK."
2235,notsarc,Then you are just throwing around words without knowing what they mean. Instead you give me a link to a page of pseudoscience. Are those the ones who lied to you?
2236,notsarc,"That was a nice rant that had absolutely nothing to do with anything. The essential question is not what various religous leaders have said about the issue, but what the Bible says about the issue."
2237,notsarc,"Actually, I meant the behaviour refered to in her post was interesting."
2238,notsarc,How many opponents of liberal gun laws live in urban areas?
2239,notsarc,I think that case was in Georgia (a different state) and so far as I know homosexuality was not involved. However if you want to worry about a legal case you need to look at Dover Pa. Not the sticker case in Cobb County.
2240,notsarc,"So now Wiesmann's barrier is the most important thing to the ToE? Somehow I doubt that biologists agree, but obviously creationists have more authority on the topic of evolution..."

2242,notsarc,"You are free to disagree with the article, Chemist99a, but it was written by a scientist.

2246,notsarc,"So what standards of proof do you hold the bible to? What allows you to hold it next to other religious or fantastical texts and say ""Yes, this one is definately, without fail, the word of God, and this one is not."""
2247,notsarc,"again, please review the definition of an atheist   humor cannot be observed by apparatus that test the physical realm. it is an abstract and intangible quality. so is beauty, artistic ability and pleasure. yet these things exist and are as real to an atheist as it is to a theist. an atheist does not need a devine revelation to appreciate intangible qualities or account for their existence. they can be detected through mental processing, and communicated so that others can agree on the quality and identify it when it is present.   being an atheist does not preclude belief in the existence of intangible and abstract things. it just precludes the belief in god and a spiritual/supernatural realm"
2248,notsarc,The question still remains as to whether this is negative intrusion (which is what the libertarians want) or positive intrusion (what the libertarians do not want.) Anyone with half a brain can know that it's intrusion. The matter becomes complicated when one tries to place it in the category of anti-murder laws or theocratic forced religion laws.
2249,notsarc,"Honestly I'm not sure if it was ever said in the Bible, but I sure have heard a lot of the Bible thumpers saying free will is a gift from God."
2250,notsarc,"So you're saying that the theory of evolution is similar to ####, in that they both make large messes when they come into contact with fans?"
2251,notsarc,"'IF' is the question. It suggests that Holy Tradition does not know the answer.   Secondly, the issue of the flood itself could still be true and tested scientifically... as to whether an historical Noah existed that you might consign to 'myth'.   Does anyone here not find it interesting that there is almost a universal factor in societies concerning a global flood?   PS I have already discussed M-Eve on another post."
2252,notsarc,Old news. There have been accusations of similar stories for years.
2253,notsarc,"We can add to this list, Singin's desire of criminalizing gun owners who don't report gun thefts in a required time and to lock up all guns in a manner that will prevent thefts. He of course says that does not mean jail, but aiding and abetting and straw sales already require serious jail time. and straw sales is already a Federal Offense with either 5 or 10 year jail terms. So we are talking about Very Serious jail terms regardless of what Sinjin might say in order to sell the idea. And one more thing the Anti-gun forces want but won't say it now."
2254,notsarc,"I had researched some stuff about viruses that was applicable about life in general because it is the only thing that is not defintely classified.   So the argument was about life, the other stuff was just peripheral. Don't make such a big deal about including other tings in it."
2255,notsarc,"think about what you just typed, that doesn't make any sense."
2256,notsarc,"Do me a favor. Write, in your own words, two paragraphs. One explaining the electromagnetic spectrum (and the visible spectrum's place in it), and one discussing rods and cones in the eyes."
2257,notsarc,The question is illogical. By declaring the existence of an all powerful God then saying God cannot do something is not a comment on his powerfulness but rather the direct representation of his nature. Your question by its very statement does not test wether or not God is all powerful but wether or not God is comprehensible. See another thread for that topic.   The statement that God is all powerful defines his nature. To state then that he cannot do something outside of his nature as proof of the non existence of his nature is circular in logic.
2258,notsarc,"But it has never been claimed that everything developet simultaneously. Probably not.   So back to the original question that you ducked with ad hoc arguments. What is Archaeopteryx. If it is a bird, why does it have a tail, grastalia, teeth, pre-orbital fenestra, and on and on. If it isn't a bird then why does it have feathers, opposable hallux, pneumatic bones, a furcula, and even a small carina in one specimen? How can creationism explain Archaeopteryx?   http://home.houston.rr.com/bybayouu/...graphica_1.jpg"
2259,notsarc,"If that's truly what the organization says, then it's a hypocrite of an organization."

2263,notsarc,I'm not sure that your comment will encourage any sort of discussion. Certainly no one is glad because your mother died so young. Not even creationists are likely to be gleeful.
2264,notsarc,"Actually, that story was an invention after the fact. It never happened. At least that is what the witnesses who were there said. Why do christians feel that it is OK to invent such stories to support their point? Isn't that lying? Isn't lying wrong?"
2265,notsarc,you know why? because God touches our hearts like nothing you have ever felt before. it is amazing
2266,notsarc,"Well since posting on this thread has died and this seems to me to be the most interesting atheistic theory, I want to get a bit of clarification.   First, what do you mean by being allowed to cease providing for it at any age, but never allowed to kill it? By this do you mean that to cease providing for during the first trimester is not killing it? Is that because it is not alive at that time?   If I follow you (and I'm not sure I do) should the mother be allowed to have the baby removed at some point during the third trimester, after which it must be kept alive (and perhaps put up for adoption)?"
2267,notsarc,"You believe two things that are incorrect: that you have refuted evolutionary theory, and that we will now accept intellegent design because of your attempt."
2268,notsarc,"The Brady Campaign whines more than they act. Making handguns legal in Chicago wouldn't make them happy. Sending the national guard in wouldn't make them happy. They don't have a solution for the problem, but they're right there to whine about it.   They're just like the Federal Government; they find something simple and complicate it."

Jus a thought."
2270,notsarc,"No. I am a student and I personally don't have much money. So how could I help them? I have very limited money of my own. I help when I can, but sometimes with my present finances I can't do much. If I had enough money, as I assume you do, than yes I would help them as much as I could. This is just an example of where people feel compassion. And as I have said before, Dawkin's has trouble explaining how the universal feelings could come about through evolution. We would not expect mutated pondscum to produce feelings and morals, ethics, etc."
2271,notsarc,"Two things, Symbiote   1) what is the objective basis of rights that makes it different from other value judgements of the majority?   2) when two rights come into conflict, is the result always simple inaction?   3) is the importance of rights greater than democracy? Or is democracy a right? If the latter, how does this work with (2)?   4) how do you react to the fact that in the sorts of cases I mention the results of a rights system is clearly bad for individual people?"
2272,notsarc,"And your analysis is flat out lacking. What everyone else seems to realize is that the reason Obama won is because of FAR higher turnout, many by African American voters. (Who more tend to be ... taa daa! ... Democrats!) There is definitely a considerable discrepancy in Obama supporters and gay marriage supporters. Of that, there can be no doubt.   And your anaysis of the FL situation is completely removed from reality. FL requires a vote of over 60% for an amendment to pass. It wouldn't pass at 59%, let alone 50. So not only do you demonstrate a lack of even knowing what was needed there, it doesn't even fit as an apt comparison."
2273,notsarc,"In point of fact, the low birth rate in most of Europe is not due to the availablity of abortion, but to good sex education and the ready availablity of effective contraception to everyone who needs it. See this study, for instance:   http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/PUB...heet/fsest.htm   People have small families because they want small families. In point of fact, the abortion rate in Europe is generally much lower than the rate in the US, due, again, to education and contraception.   Would you force folks to have children they don't want?"
2274,notsarc,"Don't you think this would fit the 'Creationism is nothing but lie's thread a bit better? Although I notice The Skeptic making disparaging remarks about your examples, it seems he attacks you more than deal with the well documented   examples you have."
2275,notsarc,"I think it's true. Why would someone make that up and pass it off as a real event?   I think the continents probably started separating some time after that, which is how God separated the people."
2276,notsarc,"So umm. What's going on? This was posted a week ago plus about 4 hours ago. I frankly don't care if my opponent posts a day late and would hate to win because of time. BUT the first post was even easier, he could have been typing it as we found judges and I think he mentioned he had started already. I PMed him earlier this week reminding him of the limit and have not recieved a response. Of course maybe the fact that he hasn't logged on since 11/14 has something to do with that."
2277,notsarc,But you can't. You may imagine it but you can't present evidence that supports your position. You can only argue against what you don't understand in the first place. I generally make it a rule to keep my mouth shut unless I have actually had the integrity to educate myself about the basics of a topic. You don't seem to do the same.
2278,notsarc,"Yes, but we had no way to tell until we found them again, now had we?"
2279,notsarc,"Well, kind of a boring thread, since everyone agrees, but since I'm new here, I may as well weigh in. Hubby and I have three grown kids and one teen. The grown ones all got the same going-to-college gifts. They got a safe car, a laptop, an emergency credit card, and a personal firearm. I felt this especially important for our daughters."
2280,notsarc,"You know, I would be fine with that as long as it were truly a middle ground. If that term were used equally among straights as well as gays.   But it's just a term. The same as with the term ""marriage.""   It's just a term. Just a word.   Personally I feel the government needs to get out of the business of marriage altogether.   Let the legal term be agreed upon unilaterally."
2281,notsarc,"Oh, so you were not in any way talking about evolution in these posts? Then why are they posted on the c vs e board?   Please, that's just pathetic."
2282,notsarc,"Actually, Peeling and others on this thread have proven you and Cash to be utterly wrong. The fact you don't recognize this is irrelevant."
2283,notsarc,"You know, I cannot even remember if we covered it in middle school or high school biology. I do remember learning about Mendel and his genetics, but I swear I can't remember if we even mentioned Darwin's name. If we spent any time on it at all, it was very little.   Our biology classes were mostly devoted to taxonomy, anatomy/physiology, and cellular machinery."
2284,notsarc,Unions fought to keep children out of work for the same reason they fought to keep blacks and women out of work - they want a monopoly on employment.
2285,notsarc,"I never said anything about a conspiracy Peeling. I very clearly gave valid reasons to Consider that scientific GRANTS and pay increases for these scientists are based on making new and previously undiscovered claims that forward the science. That is the greatest motivation to lie, cheat, create and falsify evidence which adds to the scientists personal wealth and further promotes a false science that is rife with selfish motivations to preserve, protect and promote it."
2286,notsarc,Exactly.   It seems that anyone can dream up hypotheses in evolutionary psychology.   Here's what Coyne said:
2287,notsarc,"Well, here's another quote from Allan Feduucia:   ""Feathers are unique to birds, and no known structure intermediate between scales and feathers has been identified."" (J. Alan Feduccia, The Age of Birds, Harvard University Press, 1980, pg. 52)   Sounds contradictory to me!"
2288,notsarc,"This joke is based on some reality, ""the conquest of the North Pole is traditionally credited to Anglo-American Navy engineer Robert Edwin Peary, who claimed to have reached the Pole on April 6, 1909.   Anyhow, not all jokes are completely true, how many stand up comedians have you heard??? If you were to nit pick every joke out there (being politicaly correct etc) there would be no jokes left!"
2289,notsarc,"Well, the point about evolution is that it doesn't need a god to tinker with it. Maybe you can postulate a god as the prime mover of the big bang, I don't know why you'd want to, but i suppose you could. After that, the laws of physics take over, and evolution is the result.   Even if one were to suppose a god initiated the big bang, there is no reason to suppose it took an interest in subsequent events, or nudged them down one path as opposed to any other.   Evolution doesn't need a deity in its daily operation... that's why it works so well as science!"
2290,notsarc,"Not entirely true. While we can't disprove that God created the universe, we can disprove many creationist claims. For example, we can disprove that the earth is 6000 years old."
2291,notsarc,"And many of those countries are having problems with it. Furthermore, we aren't even proposing what other countries have."
2292,notsarc,If the fetus is human is not relevant? So if everyone says it is human then it still doesn't have a right to live then huh? Do you really support the killing of an innocent life for whatever reason? Do you really think placing one human over another is good (in this case women is more important then baby)?
2293,notsarc,This also applies to tapeworms. I fail to see how it is therefore relevent to any debate on abortion.
2294,notsarc,"Yes, I've noticed that. I do think part of the problem is that he hasn't bothered to get educated in the subject. From the arguments I've seen from him over the time he's been here he seems to rely on YEC websites for information, and when he gets to something he doesn't know it seems like he cuts-and-pastes (often without fuly reading) from google (leading to the Civil War Dinosaur fiasco and the Nazca stones fiasco) that seems to support his views"
2295,notsarc,"Certainly, because with calm empathy you can casually address such a matter simply because the struggle does not pertain to you personally.   To be able to put into question the love of another human being is simply not only alarming in nature, but damning to the very definition of love, equality, and freedom in creation of man....   And to trump this as a question of morality only serves as a mask to curtail the prejudice objections one personally has to a ceremony, right, and relationship that person will not even be personally affected by...."
2296,notsarc,"Three questions:   What country operates under an ""unbridled capitalism"" system?   Can you name any nation that has operated under your idea of socialism successfully?   If the American system of government is so terrible, why do we have one of the highest standards of living on earth?   Just because you think you are entitled to what I earn doesn't make it so. Earn your own."
2297,notsarc,"That's a bad term. I wouldn't call myself that, but I do know more then average person."
2298,notsarc,"Believe me, marc, we certainly can. The fact that it damns your argument is no skin off our backs. In fact, it damns your argument so much that the producers know it. See below."
2299,notsarc,"Define ""many"". What you really mean one is too much. Even when the one is used soles for personal defense. Besides your in Austraila, no one cares what you think."
2300,notsarc,And what does Marc do?   Try to change the subject.
2301,notsarc,"The curriculum is legal outside the public school system, and used in private schools. (I left a couple of sample links on the other board.) So do you see those private schools as engaged in child abuse?"
2302,notsarc,So why should merchant ships be required to go unarmed and defenseless in dangerous areas?
2303,notsarc,The anti-abortionists claim that would be killing a human life to save one.
2304,notsarc,And SS is once again wrong. If you really believe that then try to tell your genes to give you tiger stripes which will be inherited by your children. Good luck.
2305,notsarc,"We already accept that it is. You don't have to convince us.   However, consider what this does to your argument that natural selection is random."
2306,notsarc,they may respect life but what about respecting the quality of life?   if they cared about their children's future they would not breed like rabbits. It is callous to use their children to win the 'numbers game'   quality before quantity.   I don't deny that abortion is murder in the womb though.
2307,notsarc,"My recollection is similar to yours. I encountered it in an AP biology class in high school, we spent about 1/2 the extra-long class in labs (I think that was the primary difference).   The giraffe example was an ""aha"" moment for me personally, I suspected life changed, but the specifics I had never thought about.   I recall a disclaimer at the start of the section, but I don't recall the exact wording.   -Mach"
2308,notsarc,"Since you bring it up, I do think that you are a nut. But your site is even nuttier. Not one shred of evidence that I found - just assertion. Moreover, the author doesn't seem to know the difference between an hypothesis and a theory."
2309,notsarc,So individual cells contract to move cytoplasm around and to transport oxygen within itself?
2310,notsarc,"Prove it. Got any credible scientific or sociological studies? NOPE, ya don't. Didn't think so."
2311,notsarc,"Oh sorry, I didn't understand what you were asking.   Ok, what I think happened {Like Tasyfish hinted at} was that Moses recorded what god told him or Genesis 1 because it is in more detail, and Genesis 2 is what was passed down through Noah, in Oral history, so it would differ slightly, but that's becaue of man's error, not God's."
2312,notsarc,"So, you would vote to legislate against it? Ok, now that thats cleared up, why do you consider sex to be so bad? Sex is a healthy part of a relationship or marrige, and i would not go to these lengths to minimize it. Sex has a small risk of ending in pregnancy, and an even smaller risk if using a condom, and even smaller than that if the woman uses a contraceptive. Then, if EVERYTHING fails, there would be abortion in the extreme circumstances that it does result in a pregnancy. I doubt that criminalized abortion will reduce sex. It will only cause suffering and fear for women.   I thought we were out of the dark ages already."
2313,notsarc,Right. It's called stasis. Species that are well adapted to their environments tend to change little in a stable environment. It is still true that fossil crocs are not the same as modern crocs. There are obvious differences.
2314,notsarc,Like most things theists that statement is based on ignorance.
2315,notsarc,"So let me get this straight - you admit that you are wrong, and you want me to provide documentation to prove this admission correct?   How about we both simply agree that you were wrong and move on."
2316,notsarc,"What Is a Human Person and Who Counts as a Human Person?: A Crucial Question for Bioethics by Prof. William E. May   There is also an extremely academic school of thought which views the human person in terms of the ego in all its derivations. I cannot hope to summarize what this is all about, please refer to:   Philosophical Critiques: The Human Person - 3   One could also consider the social development of an infant, inasmuch as humans are, in most cases, very social animals.   According to primatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, the human species is specifically developed to be part of a social system and a newborn infant comes ready made to push all the buttons of the system:"
2317,notsarc,So then women who are pregnant shouldn't be allowed to   1) Smoke   2) Take any kind of drug that could possibly harm the child   3) Drink   or do any otherwise legal action?   And VOR takes another giant step towards fascism.
2318,notsarc,"Well, actually society has said that 18 is the dividing line. It can then also say, that under certain circumstances, for a particularly bad person, in some cases it will be considered if the person is 16 or 17. That's why we have all the judges and lawyers, etc..."
2319,notsarc,"So, we are debating creation, yet you don't consider quoting the bible, the single most important original proponent of the creation account and to you, it doesn't qualify as a source for what is being discussed here? You say this and expect to be taken seriously?"
2320,notsarc,"Yes. It describes an action without ascribing its form to its end result, outcome, whatever but strictly to a cause/s force/s in action. That is why 'selection' is always teleological. In order to select or choose anything, an end must always be in view. There must always be a volitional discrimination of options based upon a criterion dictated by the desired end. The only time ""channel"" becomes teleological is when something live [a human or a beaver, let's say] intententionally does the channeling. But since it is understood that mechanical forces can also 'channel', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological. In the same way, 'sorting' can be considered non-teleological, hence mechanical, and thus suited to your glossary, because things can be sorted by mechanical forces alone. But 'selection' always requires volition and awareness. So 'selection' is always teleological."
2321,notsarc,"Doesn't it ever bother you that you have to come up with ridiculous hypothetical sci-fi scenarios to attempt to prove your side?   First of all, do you really think a head on life support is going to ""be no different mentally from someone with a body.""? I would say that would probably mess with somebody's head a bit.   Secondly, you sound like you believe this person who is a head on life support deserves equal rights. They are just as helpless as a fetus in the womb. Are you saying it's okay to murder people who can't think and talk? Do you believe that thinking and talking is what qualifies a person for rights?"
2322,notsarc,Another strawman.   Explain to me how new information and new features equals to new structures and body parts.   Those links have long been refuted   http://www.creationwiki.org/(Talk.Or...dd_information   http://www.creationwiki.org/(Talk.Or...e_new_features
2323,notsarc,Because? The conventional big bang is just as unlikely as God. Therefore your claim is wrong.   However the current believe mainly among physicists and astronomers is that there is no end and there is no beginning to the universe. Expansionary theories along with contractionary theories that are being observed have led many to believe that the current universe was born from the death of the last universe. There is no end and there is no beginning.   You are out of your league.
2324,notsarc,"Actually, evolution occurs on the level of the population: individuals don't change, but populations do. See the examples above."
2325,notsarc,"Because you people keep wanting one restriction after another after another after another. Nothing is ever good enough for you, you always want more than ever. Well we don't want to abide by your wishes, gun ownership is a recognized right, and your hatred of rights won't be tolerated. We're not going to just stand by and be painted as the bad guys because you have the mentally disabled belief that banning gun ownership will reduce crime, and anybody who disagrees with you want to see people killed."
2326,notsarc,"Oh shut up! You're just sore because your side lost in the McDonald case and now you're left with absolutely nothing. You know that many gun laws are going to fall to the sword of justice, and you just can't stand the fact that your side is going to be brought back into check, just like any other."
2327,notsarc,"Actually, most people do not hold the view that existing marriages should be dissolved. In Massachussetts, it's quite a minority view, almost as low as Bush's approval rating.   In any case, that is irrelevant. I was pointing out why someone might reasonably ask the question you consider so inappropriate. What I haven't seen, either from you or from any of the articles, was what the firefighter's answer was or why he refused to answer. From what I can tell from the scant coverage, he avoided answering but had no trouble discussing his political views. Odd, I think.. or just crappy coverage."
2328,notsarc,The subject matter would be life forms. The units would depend on which particular aspect you were studying   For instance to the question 'what units of measurement would you use for the effect of evolution?   I would say genetic changes that have patterns.   ID would have that and more.
2329,notsarc,Well I think that the geology of the planet would influence everything. From religions to morals and scientific progression. Because long ago on our planet Europe not only thought the world was flat and they could fall over at the edge into an abyss but Europe generally didn't have knowledge of the Asian cultures until the silk road was active. If the asian and european cultures were not so greatly distanced from each other history would have been greatly changed to the extent that compared to our world would be pretty loopy
2330,notsarc,Correct. Form letters go in a junk pile. Individual letters are a different matter.
2331,notsarc,Right. The frenquecy of the alles have changed over time.
2332,notsarc,"And the mall plainly had ""no guns allowed"" signs displayed at all the entrances, meaning the shooter broke the law when he brought his gun in and started shooting.   Now, find me a school massacre that took place where concealed carry is actually legal on campus."
2333,notsarc,"You are correct, but contingency must be in place to deal with it when it occurs.   Look at what happened in Eire with ""Case X"" in 1992- what happens when a country with the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe has to face up to the issue of pregnacy as a consequence of rape:   http://www.prochoiceforum.org.uk/ireland6.asp   Pages 12-13 of this EU report (Adobe Acrobat reader required):   http://www.newr.bham.ac.uk/pdfs/Repr...m%20Bremen.pdf"
2334,notsarc,I hope I have already begun to change your mind.
2335,notsarc,"So when you're doing math, you're an atheist? Of course not. Just because there is overlap doesn't mean that the two views are identical."
2336,notsarc,"Yes. I believe it's a matter of personal individual freedom.   If purchased legally, and not used to commit a crime, what harm comes from handgun ownership? I don't own one, but I own many other guns. If they can ban handguns, what's to stop them from banning shotguns, or even BB guns?   I don't believe in a nanny state, taking away my toys ""for my own good"".   Waxy"
2337,notsarc,"And for good reason. Electrical engineers in general have a pretty poor track record when discussing issues that have nothing to do with... electrical engineering. Examples: Walter ReMine, Fred Williams, etc."
2338,notsarc,"So even though you can legally conceal carry right up to the gate of the national parks, and you can legally hunt within the parks, somehow concealed carry in the parks will become more dangerous?"
2339,notsarc,"So, you don't see how stating that in a functioning democratic society guns belong only in the hands of the state is not anti gun?? Maybe you could give us an example of a statement that is more anti gun that that because I am having trouble imagining one."
2340,notsarc,"Well sigma, which is more painful??   Being burnt with salene for 30 minutes to an hour and if that doesnt work after the 3rd time, being born prematurally and laid on a table and starving to death.....   OR   A woman sticking a clothes hanger up and accidentally killing herself but intentionally killing the kid within her?   seems to me that people dont really care about how the baby feels. It has just as much feeling as the mother."
2341,notsarc,"Prove it then. If this is a fact, there will be research on the subject on the net somewhere comparing the effects of the two.   In terms of addiction, alcohol is far worse than pot apparently.   http://www.tfy.drugsense.org/tfy/addictvn.htm"
2342,notsarc,"Hmm . . . funny, I don't remember ever hearing a pro-lifer say that pregnancy was a wonderful snuggly thing or the best thing in the world. What I do see is pro-lifers like myself wondering why pregnancy is protrayed (in the form of a generalization) as so horrible by people such as yourself who just described it as ""unbelievably"" hard to go through, or a ""life threatening condition"" like malignant cancer. You didn't qualify it by saying ""some"" pregnancies are life threatening or unbearable. Maybe yours was, but how can you say that for every woman in the world? I know for a fact that my wife's pregnancy was not ""unbelievably hard to go through""--she's told me otherwise and I believe her. Sorry, but I believe my wife over you.   What you did was use unfounded generalizations, which is exactly the sort of thing this thread is about."
2343,notsarc,"It's NOT any of my business, but when presenting information to the readers at large, such topics need to be ####ing addressed, something militant pro-abortionist seldom want to bring up.   I'm actually happy that you had a good operation and think more should go into ensuring ALL women have the same low risk proceedures when necessary.   We're dealing with health aspects, all, not just selective. And there may even be things I'm not aware about to consider."
2344,notsarc,"Ditto squared. If they support killing a perfectly healthy unborn child, they will argue that the reason stated in the Op is the main reason Abortion is needed and justified. And I must say that if 98% of all abortions were performed for that reason, the public stance against them might not be so strong."
2345,notsarc,But is the Red Cross Christian? Obviously most contributors are Christian. That's obvious as most Americans are Christian.
2346,notsarc,"Actually, I snipped your remarks because 1) you twisted what I said and 2) I'm already spending too much time arguing with random complainers and I was in a hurry to do something more important at the time."
2347,notsarc,"Is that a trick question? No, the tabloid and other gutter press keep going on about how bad it is, because they sell papers by fanning fear and hatred, and fear of crime is one of their biggest markets. Yes there has been an increase in gun crime over the years, but that's largely attributable to increased attractiveness of crime in a society where social mobility has come to a standstill. In any case the number of incidents where firearms are used in crime is still very small, which is why every time someone gets shot it is headline news.   Guns are incredibly rare in this country, the only time I've seen guns in real life (other than air rifles) is on a military base."
2348,notsarc,"And you people whine at me about using personal insults ( )... anyhow, once a fetus is eight months, I believe, they are fully developed and ready for a premature birth. I was born prematurely, so don't tell me it doesn't happen. So if you get an abortion at eight months, you're not killing a fetus, you're killing a baby."
2349,notsarc,"'Self-defense' never enters into it, imo. Unwillingness to share ones body is not necessarily self-defense, so this does not apply."
2350,notsarc,"And who makes the decision, Rich? That's the issue, as I see it. I don't believe the government has any business in a woman's body."
2351,notsarc,So do you want to argue my points or do you want to argue me? Which of my bullits are wrong? Which of them are right?
2352,notsarc,"It is horribly oppressive of women, though, to oppose both abortion and contraceptives. That means that women will have no control over their pregnancies at all."
2353,notsarc,"This question is premised on an untenable assumption: that people should not be allowed to vote on particular issues. This premise is clearly not true in any democratic society, and is especially not true in the United States. In the United States, it is a contradiction in terms to say someone is not allowed to vote on X. I have demonstrated this before, and yet the same silly question keeps coming up."
2354,notsarc,"Apparently, all them dinosaurs were just too dumb to climb to higher ground or swim (despite the fact that animals are among the first to do so in disasters - example would be the tsunami in Christmas 2004) All of this also avoids the flying reptiles such as the Pteranodons.   Also, apparently humans are unique in that they are the only ones whose corpses bload and float to the water's surface.   What garbage will they come up with next?"
2355,notsarc,Are you saying that given enough time you can come with answers? That's a statement of faith.
2356,notsarc,"Why would that even be expected? When you consider that it is important to maintain some sort of consistency in study populations, obvious mutants are excluded from the breeding stock. And yet, there are frequent observed mutations. In fact, my elder son once observed two mutations in a single fly in one of his populations. One fly had no wings and white eyes."
2357,notsarc,"What basis do fundamental rights derive from? In other words, how can we tell whether something is a fundamental human right?"
2358,notsarc,Please off one scientific piece of evidence in support of biblical creation.
2359,notsarc,This remains unspecified. (I explained this in the last paragraph)
2360,notsarc,"You know, your comparison of those that fought to end segregation, to those that fight to enact gun ban and gun control laws, is nothing more than a cheap and dirty tactic that does nothing to address the issue, and everything to suggest that breaking the law is alright if you're a politician or legislator.   There's a very large difference between people like Rosa Parks, and the mayor of Philadelphia; gun ownership is protected by the Constitution, segregation wasn't.   The fact that you're comparing those who instituted civil disobedience for good reasons, to those who want to violate state laws to pass their own laws because they think they know better and have a right to do so, just shows that you can't address the point at hand."
2361,notsarc,"No, I think you're trying to do more than that. You're trying to say that the increase in crime is due to a lack of gun ownership, aren't you? Because if you are, the article you cite doesn't back up that claim.   What, no actual data to back up any of your claims? Do you have access to US crime numbers? How many armed breakins do you get in a country where people do have guns? That's the comparison that needs to be made here."
2362,notsarc,"Just to be sure you understood, it was the picture below that picture you were supposed to look at."
2363,notsarc,"no, you just live on delusions.   you can't argue the merits of creationism on their own because they don't exist.   Creationism is a fraud regardless of the existance of evolution."
2364,notsarc,"But you haven't looked. You may claim that your god did it, and no evidence to support or deny that can be offered. The assertion relies on miracle and has no suporting evidence. But when you start talking about how your god did it, your claims can be debunked by facts. Certainly the mythology of ancient nomadic herdsmen is not accurate. If you look at the world and the history of the world the is evident in the geologic strata, then you can see that the earth is very old, and you can see a succession of organisms through time. When considered with other fields of science from genetics to biogeography to physiology and anatomy, evolution becomes apparent."
2365,notsarc,"Contraceptives (for example a condom/ the pill) aren't going to last a month effectively. Then there's the fact that contraceptives, given the above data, can still be 99% effective, as it doesn't mention how many pregnancies they've prevented.   What does the writer make of this though? ""According to this, condoms have a high failure rate for pregnancy."""
2366,notsarc,"By removing you mean Killing the innocent of course, which is different to imprisonment of the criminal."
2367,notsarc,"Because you asked me to quote your lies. I did. Not only can you not find whichever source you claim speaks of birds' infrared vision, you apparently can't find any source that does so. Despite this, you've been whining about how visible and UV camouflage must be moot because of birds IR vision.   And to top it off, rather than admit to your mistaken memory, you're blaming the imaginary source:"
2368,notsarc,"why the comparison of gun owners yo violent killers and serial rapists? What law have I broken? Since we are doing comparisons your anti-freedom agenda is very similar to the bazi gun control laws of the 1930s, it is like the jim crow laws of the US. Your agenda is one of racism. This is insulting, ignorant, and shows your true colors as an enemy of freedom."
2369,notsarc,"...and if RMNS doesn't explain the development of hands or feet, it's pretty safe to say it doesn't explain the development of anything else, either."
2370,notsarc,"So, in summary, you aren't against the death penalty on principle. You just want it used judiciously? Same here. Where we'll differ is in the details of what's judiciously."
2371,notsarc,"But your proof didn't claim that God could do anything possible. Maybe only one person could build a computer, maybe one person could make a car, maybe one person could run the mile in under 4 minutes. That doesn't mean that God can do ALL of these things. It means that whoever we define to be the greatest being, we can call him god and thus he exists. Of course this wouldn't be sufficient to Christians as this says that God is probably mortal and has the limits of being a physical being."
2372,notsarc,"If you think something is correct then you believe this.   That's all believe means.   I believe the above statement is very true.   Except that you wouldn't have to completely change your ideas or beliefs about the universe all the time. But you'd have to modify them.   Anyway, who said beliefs had to be static and fixed?"
2373,notsarc,So why are you here? Do you have anything to offer of any substance?
2374,notsarc,"Well regulated as in the second amendment does not mean regulated by the government, it means well equiped and prepared. The framers of the constitution often spoke of a tyrannical government and how to keep one from coming to power, so why in the hell would they have said lets just give the government total control of guns. Your definition of well regulated makes about as much sense as adding another day to the week."
2375,notsarc,"Well, I suppose that the reply it took me almost 5 minutes to type, a couple more to check and a couple to correct will not suffice now."
2376,notsarc,The main incentive for a male child is that in China you can only have one child without severe penalties and a female child means the family name is lost.
2377,notsarc,I see no reason why secular shows should be required to mention your mythology.
2378,notsarc,"That's true, but how much have we actually learned, and how much have we theorized, with an atheist presupposition, the only presupposition currently allowed?"
2379,notsarc,Well they'd be the experts on it; most of their members have been ruled as fitting under said category.   Let's face facts. Nobody who's in their right mind could actually believe the kind of nonsense they spread.
2380,notsarc,"The simple fact is that people don't want the immense responsibility that logically pertains to their voluntary actions actions, so they fabricate denials of reality as a convenient escape, out of pure selfishness-- like every other atrocity in history.   The study of law includes an analysis of how people excuse their wrongdoings, fabricating pausible rationalizations for their acting to benefit at another's expense; denial is typically the first of these, claiming that the act ""does not hurt anyone,"" however obvious the contrary. Other rationales follow, such as self-preservation, natural right to act, and eventually growing defensive by blaming the victim.   While the fabricator typically believes his story original, it is anything but-- it's simply the inevitable course of selfishness."
2381,notsarc,"Ingus, please see my comments at the end of my previous post.   The purpose of this thread is to introduce ourselves and have a Q&amp;A about the basis for each others views etc.   If you want to debate the specific differences we may have in our views, either open a new thread and invite me over, challenge me, whatever...   But I'm not going to debate it here.   I think this thread is a great idea.   People should introduce themselves, lay out their views however they see fit and let others do the same."
2382,notsarc,"But we certainly have the right to evict such persons.   But then, regardless, the embryo is not a person."
2383,notsarc,"Reasonable people would look for justification for their beliefs.   Many who have beliefs based on faith, however, accept things because they feel like accepting them. Including, absolute truths, and contradictions.   The resultant SHOULD be peaceful acceptance because after all, they can both be correct, yet be in contradiction, according to faith-based belief systems. The reality would probably be, as you say, that they would mix up faith and reason and start claiming one is ""actually correct"", and the other is ""The work of the devil"", and proceed to clobber the other religion, absorb their members, abordb the traditions that were ""popular"" from the other religion, rename them and re-color them to match their religion, and carry on proclaiming truth and the afterlife and mercy and whatever else pops into their heads.   That's of course, based on what I've seen and read.   -Mach"
2384,notsarc,"Everything basically.   You're held captive by hostile natives that have set up barricades and checkpoints around the property you live on. They decide when you get to come in and go out, and the police have decided to abandon you rather than come to your aid. And Canada has laws that make defense with a firearm either impractical or out right illegal depending on just where you life."
2385,notsarc,"Yea the legalizatioin of drugs would cause an epedimic of problems. Crime, suicide, mental health problems, and physical health problems."
2386,notsarc,The Skeptic has requested no judges.   This actually suits me as there are too many of you that I'd have to pick from and I therefore avoid slighting anyone by not picking them
2387,notsarc,"Just like we waited until after society decided how it would view civil rights for blacks?   No one is forcing you to debate the constitutional issues. If you don't wish to, fine; don't. I seriously doubt if anyone would miss your input."
2388,notsarc,I believe studies have already been done on that subject.
2389,notsarc,And you believe that to be what? You really need to just say who/what you think the Creator is to save us from having to make all these clarification posts.
2390,notsarc,We don't live on carbon dioxide. We live from the energy stored in carbon compounds when we break them down.
2391,notsarc,"Then you freely admit that you lied when you said this, and I quote: People like Arch are setting it as opposed to science and in that position it will be doomed to fail.   AND   Arch is doing nothing but distorting the very thing he holds so dear, I mean, how is accurately quoting passages from the bible distorting it in any way? You do nothing but post drivel which makes no factual statements at all. And you call that debating?"
2392,notsarc,"No, it's not an ""inability"" at all. It's a simple matter of you trying to take what IS a religious issue for many people and divorce it from religion altogether. That's not going to happen for many people.   And BTW, if you are going to refer to people as ""Antis"", at least be upfront about what you feel they are ""anti-"" toward. ""Anti-gay?"" ""Anti-gay marriage?"" What?   But behind that are deeper, more fundamental issues about what homosexuality IS and the morality of it. To many people who view homoseuxality as immoral, your movement seems to be trying to write immorality into law."
2393,notsarc,"Oh, don't be so hasty Bear in mind that at the scale upon which bacteria operate, molecules are significant physical structures. The bacterial flagellum, for instance, is an outboard motor constructed directly out of proteins, which are in turn directly, physically translated via RNA from DNA sequences. The physical shape of the folded molecular structure of those proteins is what makes the motor work. So there's nothing abstract about the relationship between DNA and the organism's physical form or abilities."
2394,notsarc,"Heart bypass, prostate cancer.......I have a couple of Canadian friends who needed those surgeries and one was told he had a 4 month wait and the other a 6 month wait so they both came down to Bellingham Wash and had the Surgery within 2 weeks............"
2395,notsarc,"So my question is this: Why doesn't a chihuahua birthe a Siberian husky in the Antarctic, or even in Siberia?   Oh, my other question is this: Why do animals die young instead of adapt?"
2396,notsarc,"So a free society is one where the goverment does not have tabs on their citizens? How could then the goverment work when it does not know who they actually govern? The foundation of economics is that you have correct data, else its the beginning of corruption not freedom.   And since when was there a dichotomy between freedom and socialism?   Further how does the usage of identification ease the rounding up of suspects? Wouldnt it be rather MORE risk to be rounded up if you couldnt identify yourself and thus automatically become suspect than be able to and take yourself out of the calculation?"
2397,notsarc,"And religion is what caused the Crusades and most other wars in the past, and many wars, and bloody disputes, to this very day. Many, many, many, many, many more people have died in the name of religion than in anything that could be called ""in the name of atheism""."
2398,notsarc,"So, because they don't interpret the bible as you do, they believe that there are no deities? That is what you said..."
2399,notsarc,"Nice try. If America was an Ally to Germany during WWII, to this day you wouldn't forgive US Citizens no matter what excuse they have."
2400,notsarc,"Yep, he dodged it again. Care to explain your views on Creation in the Tanakh for the folks here?"
2401,notsarc,"Guess what, I'm pro-life as well, that is why I'm also pro-choice."
2402,notsarc,"I've never been to Amsterdam.   A friend of mine went and he liked it.   I'd like to go someday.   Hell, I'd just like to get my XXX anywhere, really."
2403,notsarc,"yes, but adam wasnt created with hereditary information or from sperm and egg cells. adam was the prototype. any subsequent humans should be born following the fashion in which adam was made. otherwise adam could have been shaped like a goat and still bear human children, because god could have formed him into whatever shape or lack of shape he wanted, yet put the genetic information in him to produce human offspring. why should adam's children look like adam? wouldnt adam's children be born the way adam was created, or not?"
2404,notsarc,"Well, those who keep using that story can't see the real sins of those cities. They are so sure that it was rampent homosexuality which lead to their destruction. Even though we know that before the Angels were ever sent God had spelled out why he was going to destroy them. He sent the angels because they promiced to find even one righteous man. They failed in that because the angels were attacked for being foreigners. Noone who abuses this story is ever going to admit this fact. They can't see past the supposed homosexual issue."
2405,notsarc,It has a financial impact on ALL taxpayers. To say that it has no impact on anyone else is disengenuous.
2406,notsarc,"Yes, they do show a faithful devotion to the ultimate reality that there are no gods. You're an atheist, aren't you?"
2407,notsarc,"If you wanted to be picky about it, I guess you could say that it was a form of last-ditch birth control, after the other forms failed."
2408,notsarc,"Do the words ""govt. by the people and for the people"" not matter to you at all? Furthermore, to say that the constitution shouldn't be allowed under the vote of the people itself in unconstitutional, since that's the only way the Constitution CAN be amended. (2/3 of states)   A country that uses judges to determine such sweeping things as redefining marriage is a ""legistocracy"", which we are quickly turning into as a nation. Even though judges are supposed to interpret the constitution, it's still putting the fate of the people in the hands of individuals regarding their laws. This is not very far removed from monarchy. Personally, I think our founding fathers and the Constitutional framers are rolling over in their graves right now."
2409,notsarc,Yea I agree with you on how there was no exact se t of laws at the beginning of creation. The reason I say that they most likely didn't marry their sisters is mostly cause God gets mad at Cain and places a mark on his head so everyone he runs across will not kill him unless they want to die a death 10 times worse than his. Kinda just says that there are other people out there.
2410,notsarc,"Is it correct to assume that in the presence of the precursors of the standard genetic code (e.g. intermediates of glucose degradation and the citric acid cycle), the intimate relationship between these molecules resulted in the inevitable organization of the genetic code (global optimum of the system)?   Articles 5-7   These articles discuss fascinating mathematical representation of the genetic code. For example, in article 6 a representation of the genetic code as a sixdimensional Boolean hypercube is proposed.   Abstract:"
2411,notsarc,"Well try Arkansas (75/25), Georgia (76/24), Kentucky (75/25), Michigan (59/41), Mississippi (86/14), Montana (67/33), North Dakota (73/27), Ohio (62/38), Oklahoma (76/24), Oregon (57/43), and Utah (66/34).   All of these margins were well above the percentage of votes cast for Bush and Kerry, respectively. Ohio, for instance, went to Bush by 2%, but the ban was passed by 24%. Bush lost Oregon by 4%, but the ban passed by 14%. Bush lost Michigan by 3%, but the ban passed by 18%. The margin of victory for each of these states exceeds George Bush's margin of victory in that state. Those extra votes had to come from somewhere, and it seems like many people other than the ""religious right"" feel the same way."
2412,notsarc,But only if they're willing to receive one. Most aren't.
2413,notsarc,"Actually it wouldn't. Since there is no rational, believable evidence for creationism, it wouldn't be any more believable if evolution were disproved. As an example, I dare you to start a thread in an appropriate forum and give us tested evidence for a global flood as depicted in Genesis. Good luck."
2414,notsarc,"Well, HRC estimates that the costs would be negligable and that some governments would actually save money. They site many studies on the issue, which I have not taken the time to look up, as I think this sort of statistic is worthless. It is unreasonable to ask same-sex couples to pay for the marriage of opposite-sex couples without asking opposite-sex couples to return this payment. Still, you seem very concerned about it, so I will provide this link:   http://www.hrc.org/Template.cfm?Sect...entDisplay.cfm   It is an interest group in favor of gay rights, yes, but that doesn't make them wrong. I did have a link to an actual study on the topic, but I cannot seem to find it. I'm sure if I scoured the Internet more, I could come up with something."
2415,notsarc,"Well, that's generally true of any process that uses energy. Some is wasted."
2416,notsarc,"Actually, I believe it was a Reagan policy continued by both Bushes."
2417,notsarc,"Look over the Heller ruling again. All nine judges agreed unanimously that the Second Amendment protected a right that was wholly individual in nature. The only disagreement was whether the right still applied today.   And no, the individual states and cities shouldn't be allowed to set their own standards for a constitutional right, that flies in the face of the 14th Amendment. And worse, you're arguing for precedent that would basically allow the various states to not respect your other rights; they could ban the shirt you choose to wear because it's offensive to some small, insignificant minority somewhere."
2418,notsarc,So you're actually claiming that it is a lie to say that the UK has a lower gun crime rate than the US? Even if the police were miscounting crimes it's still a huge and unjustified leap in logic to conclude from that that the UK does not have a lower gun crime rate.
2419,notsarc,I see I jumped the gun. That was well stated.
2420,notsarc,"Really? A lot of people say that every answer makes more questions. In some ways we seem to know less now than we did at the time of Newton, in that we are less certain.   And Newton's laws deal with what happens in a vacuum with no resistance, not direct human experience   At any rate, my point is that you can't see all the evidence as piling up support for 'science' as 'science' is moulded to fit that evidence. Not a criticism of science, btw."
2421,notsarc,"The comic relief doesn't even recognize it has passed in on, or attempted to!"

2425,notsarc,"The average global temperature follows a sinusoidal pattern, the general consensus is we are supposed to be approaching a peak.

2429,notsarc,"Well, really, they both compensate and reciprocate for one another, you could say."
2430,notsarc,"Really, then show me how I'm wrong - without dogmatic statements. I would suggest, given the fact that you feel the need to ignore science, deny obvious facts of reason, and cling to evolutionary theory, that it is you that has the problem with religion - your naturalistic religion. I would further suggest that you stop attibuting your personal opinions to science, and start calling your comments what they really are, personal opinion.   -By the way, is everyone who disagrees with you promoting a ""religious agenda?"" Where have I leaned on religion to make my point? And what makes you think that I need religion to defeat your postion as I have here? I've used science, scientific journals, and good sound reasoning to defeat your comments. I suggest you rethink what you're saying. It sure sounds like you're the one with the ""religious agenda."""
2431,notsarc,"As the Christian Right's poster boy, this is hugely damaging, don't you think? Also makes him very hypocritical (or, dare I say, a FLIPFLOPPER?! ) since he is campaigning against open abortion now."

No, of course not.

A lot of folks (I would say the majority) view it as evolution used as a vehicle for intellient design (basically ""god planned it and made it all happen"").   The movement to teach YEC is non existant. Creationism does not necessarily=YEC. The YEC crowd is their own little clique of scientific illiterates. I have been on the local board of education for 2 years now and have never heard the phrase ""Young Earth Creationists"" in any official capacity, nor has anybody ever suggested that it be taught. I had no idea what a ""young earth creationist"" was until I read it on this board, 6 months ago. It is simply not an issue, and I am right in the middle of Kansas."

A more dishonest way of avoiding the meat of my argument couldn't be formed except by a manipulative, insincere and philosophical coward of jitobear's caliber. That's why there's nothing she wrote that's worth responding to. As usual she hasn't actually responded to anything I said.

If you believe in the biblical god then presumably you believe in prophecy, which mandates that god created the whole of time and space as one.

Some sort of extra-dimensional grad student may have created this universe in a lab for his thesis, and it would still fit the model I just gave.   And what do you mean by ""created evolution""?

Education and career opportunities for women would be another thing that would limit the number of children.   Education about, as well as concern for the effects of overpopulation on the world would also limit population.   Actually, a major factor is pure and simple access to decent and comprehensive health care. Most people used to choose to have large families because so many children died in infancy. If they are assured that their children will live to adulthood, people won't feel the need to have large families to ensure that at least some of them will survive.   Also, religions that demean women and forbid contraception should be restrained from determining public policy."

Someone who commits a crime that serious should at least be behind bars for the rest of their life, no parole at all.

2471,notsarc,"No, not true at all. G-d desires for us to willingly love Him suprememly and for our lives to be guided by Him just as any earthly father would guide his own children. Hell is a place of utter torment that people, who reject G-d, choose to end up in. Consequences of our decisions have eternal signifigance."
2472,notsarc,"No, nothing to do with it. Economics is not the product of morality...the most you can say is that one system of economics will be more flexible with different morality systems. It would be hard to argue that capitalism isn't the system to best handle different moralities.   And if they are governed and regulated people can be victimized by the system. In fact, the regulation might be the very thing victimizing people. Again, it isn't the system but the people who are in society that make a morality."
2473,notsarc,"No, the legal middle ground between no same-sex marriage and only same-sex marriage is marriage for all, just as the legal middle ground between no opposite-sex marriage and only opposite-sex marriage is marriage for all.

More damagingly, however, if you examine it for more than a moment it doesn't even fulfill the role you give it. You say 'many things in nature make no sense without God', but how do god's origins and nature make sense? Where did he/she/it spring from? All you do by invoking god as an 'explanation' is push the problems one step further back. The god hypothesis may look like an explanation, but it is not."
2484,notsarc,"Part of the problem with the abortion issue goes with our perception of the value of animal life in general. We see a fly and swat it. We see a rat and set a dog on it. We see a cockroach and stamp on it. Pests. No problem. But when elephants trample villages, or other warm-blooded mammals become pests, there's an outcry about the destruction method. We don't see giant sledgehammers swatting elephants! - practicalities aside. Destruction has to be humane. And when it suits our purposes. It seems that cuddly, warm-blooded, embryo look-alikes get more emotional feeling than flies, cockroaches, mosquitos et al.   From a strictly 'argument' point of view, emotion shouldn't enter the picture. If pro-lifers/anti-abortionists looked at the issue dispassionately and rationally (difficult, I know), then they may well end up with a different viewpoint.   How do we take the emotion out of argument?"

If a criminal is prohibited from legally purchasing a firearm and wish to acquire one, they either steal one or buy one from another criminal who has stolen one.   3. It is already illegal in the U.S. for any felon, mentally ill person, or anyone convicted of domestic violence to own or even touch a firearm, yet these individuals ignore the law and obtain firearms anyway.   4. All gun control does is make it that much more difficult for the average law abiding citizen to own a firearm."

2506,notsarc,That viability isn't a good basis for determining abortion laws?   That the point in a pregnancy when a fetus is viable is earlier than once believed owing to medical advances?   Do you think this has no realistic limit?

Statute requires that every male over the age of 14 turn out at their local churchyard, on a Saturday, for two hours of longbow practice for the purposes of maintaining a functioning militia.   It's generally regarded as an anarchronism hereabouts. We did have a civil war in the meantime but somehow everyone who wanted to get involved managed to find themselves a weapon and it all turned out okay.

Just a myriad of opinions which inevitable lead to either abortion is right or abortion is wrong. No different now then when Roe v Wade became law or any other times in history. I do like Aristotle's take; He taught that a fetus originally had a vegetable soul but he didn't say what kind of vegetable."
2543,notsarc,"Well of course. This spiritually dead church which exists to serve Man, but not God, must compromise biblical principles in order to attempt to preserve membership in an ever expanding secular humanist society.

2544,notsarc,"Well said Jito.   I don't understand why pro-lifers dismiss pregnancy as easy and/or suggest that it's a wonderful snuggly thing that's just the best thing in the world. Even if you want a baby, it's unbelievably hard to go through and something your body never fully recovers from. If you don't want a baby and are being forced to go through it, it's unbearable.   You can't force somebody to go through this life-threatening condition that is always physically harmful."

2547,notsarc,"Well this is what i am saying. The probability of a and b in one organism i very low. And the probability of A and B in many generations is lower than just A. This is what Behe deals with in his book. One reason evolution of primates interest me more than bacteria is the the number of organisms and generations is much much lower, and the changes involved must be pretty big. It involves Real evolution as opposed to stuff like antibiotic resistance or sicke cell haemoglobin that i see more as a reversable adaption, not a developement to a permanently better/more complex state.   IMO there should be possible to make some sort of calculation regarding the probability of RM being cause of the changes."
2548,notsarc,"Well, I like to call myself, liberally conservative. I vote my guns. If the candidate says he'll protect my gun rights, and he, or she, has the history to prove it, they'll get my vote.   So, no, I didn't vote for Obama, in spite of what he said during the campaign, and in spite of that traitorous NRA member who made that disgusting ad for BHO.   Frankly, I'd have preferred someone other than McCain also, but all the better choices were not in the race."
2549,notsarc,"Well, assuming that the slavery amendments to the federal constitution were repealed, then slavery certainly could be reintroduced. Minority freedoms are denied all the time. The right to murder, for example. I do not believe in the tyranny of the majority; I believe in the majority's right to legitimately wield its power. If we are not going to be governed by majority rule, then what will we be governed by? If not rule by the many, do you propose we be ruled by the few? Would you really be happy to live under a dictator?   Because self-government loses its meaning totally if the people are prohibited from amending their constitution by persons other than themselves. I really do not support rule by the very, very few.   Because this question is irrelevant."

2551,notsarc,"Well, we really don't know. However we do know that the woman has self conscious, and feels pain. Something the fetus lacks. She also can interact with other human beings, and develop relationships and attachments. Another thing the fetus lacks. Phisically, she is larger and much more capable than the fetus, and has a formed brain. Another thing the fetus lacks.   In conclusion, we really don't know. But, we do know that the woman can do, feel, and become more than a fetus is."

2554,notsarc,"What does adoption have to do with being pro choice or life? I thought that the waiting list was years and years long to get a baby. (Not trying to argue, just don't understand)"
2555,notsarc,"What's a ""marriage officer""? If that's like a priest or minister, than certainly they shouldn't have to perform a ceremony that doesn't coincide with their beliefs. But if it's a government position, like a justice of the peace, then they should either leave their religion at home when they go to work, or get a job that doesn't conflict with their beliefs. Religious freedom does not give you the freedom to deny freedom to someone else."
2556,notsarc,"When it comes to all the examples that Behe had provided in both his first book, and his second book , it has been shown to be able to evolve naturally.   That means, in principle, IC systems can evolve. If you don't believe so, bring forth the I.C. system of your choice.   To say 'But you don't know all the answers' is just the logical fallacy known as 'argument from ignorance'.   Behe brings a system up that he claims is IC.. the pathway for evolution is discovered, and Behe trys another one. How dishonest can you get?   The concept is falsified."
2557,notsarc,"When the ""right to privacy"" is interpreted by the courts so widely &amp; loosely as to include the denial of the rights and personhood of prebirth children,....

With womens right's getting shredded in the debate over abortion, fewer and fewer women are going to want to even risk have sex with men at all. It'll cause a wave of abstinence and imprisonment that will cut succesive generations in half. That'll even further errode the solvancy of social security. "
2562,notsarc,"Wrong again. If she supported bans on all guns then why would she say ""I know the sense of helplessness that people feel. I know the urge to arm yourself because that's what I did. I was trained in firearms. I'd walk to the hospital when my husband was sick. I carried a concealed weapon. I made the determination that if somebody was going to try to take me out, I was going to take them with me.""   Shes Jewish too so shes definitly not on Hitlers side."
2563,notsarc,"Yes, any legal argument which relies exclusively on religious doctrine is indeed harboring on freedom of religion infringement. The same holds true for all civil rights which have had opposition from the ""religious-right."""
2564,notsarc,"Yes, but...   Sotomayor is a very strict legal beagle. Had I the best sort of law degree from the best university, I would very much fear to take her on in the field of established law. She observes the law down to the last dot, dash and comma.   However... while the right to choose is still a part of established law, the radical and experimental present Supreme Court does not hesitate in the least to legislate new law and new meanings to law. Were Sotomayor to be persuaded by the Roman Catholic cabal of the U.S. Supreme Court that the Court should take it upon itself to rewrite Roe v. Wade, she might join in with the legislative five to make a new and more restrictive law regarding abortion."

2568,notsarc,"Yet that is an argument used by most LIB DIM GGs. Now there may be some consternation as to my use of that term, but gun control is for most purposes, the baliwick of those same minions.   It will always be easy for the crimiinals to acquire those weapons. Nine million anti-gun laws will not change that."

2570,notsarc,You actually can vote on this (of have your legislatures do it). Some issues require more than just a majority but you can still vote.

This doesn't mean its the right thing to do but this is a flaw of democracy.

Why does the innocent baby have to forfeit its life?
2580,notsarc,You misunderstand me I believe they should all be locked up. Anyone who preaches against gay people freely living their lives as equal citizens with all the rights and responsibilites should be locked up in the darkest dungeon. There can be no compromise on this issue peoples lives are at stake.
2581,notsarc," take the Bible out of the context of God for a minute and \""have a squiz\"" at it as a book of fiction you just borrowed from the library.Waxy"" You never actually observe something happening the instant it is, and most of the time you are just observing effects that event caused. The actual time ago the event was is pretty much irrelevant other than the amount of data you can get - if given the results from an experiment done several hundred years ago (well beyond anyone's lifespan) does this mean that they are now automatically untrue? "
2582,notsarc,"You presume correctly, sir.  Overall the USSR could produce almost the same level of technology the US could during the cold war; however the restrictive nature of Soviet society during that time I believe quashed the possibility of many bright Soviet citizens to be better educated, and eliminated the possibility that many of them could reach their potential. I hope the situation is improving there; guess we'll find out in 50 years.   Another factor that contributed was the fact that there are more remote and undeveloped areas in the former USSR than in the US, which supports the idea that parts of the Soviet Union were (and may still be) less developed."
2583,notsarc,"You said there that you wanted guns in schools so that kids could defend themselves. How is that a misinterpretation?   You're asking for proof of a negative. How many massacres would have occured if guns were common in school? We don't know...   Erm.... You're saying that people don't try to harm one another over those things? I suggest you surf youtube for a bit. Rememeber however, that kids are more emotionally unstable than adults. Hormones and guns aren't a good combination.   I agree that's silly. I'm more worried about your statement that students should carry in class."
2584,notsarc,"You're totally on the money. Look, I'm a gay man. I married a woman. Did anyone care? Would Archie have cared? Did the goverment care? Would anyone care what we have done, or asked us what our sexual practices were, or if I'd gone out and had affairs with men while we were married? (Which I didn't, by the way.)   NO.   A big fat NO.   Porn stars, atheists, necrophiliacs, convicted murderers and even homosexuals can go out and get married right and left. It's not about the ""morality"" of gay people, that's for sure. That is pure, unadultered BS. They'll let gays marry... as long as it's to the opposite sex... and preferably not to their own daughters.   The stictest anti-gay fundamentalist could give a good G*d d*amn about any of that as long as the wedding pictures show a man and a woman."
2585,notsarc,"[quote=Galileo]Congress has justified its regulation of guns based on the Commerce Clause and the Taxing and Spending Clause of the Constitution.   [quote]   You mean this one?   According to dictionary.com:   commerce ( P ) Pronunciation Key (kmrs)   n.   1. The buying and selling of goods, especially on a large scale, as between cities or nations. See Synonyms at business.   2. Intellectual exchange or social interaction.   3. Sexual intercourse.   While I really hope it doesn't refer to #3 and I doubt it means #2, I would think it means #1.   So it can regulate buying and selling among the states, with foreign countries, and with Indian tribes. So as long as it is sold in the state, the federal government has no power to regulate it. I always thought it was just the states that did that, but the 2nd amendment stops them from doing that. Or so I thought."

2600,notsarc," there is no doubt that the employee was trying to figure out a way to perpetrate a deception in order to circumvent the law. It is also true that the video taping of parties without their consent is likewise a violation of California law.With that established  I would be interested in your comments."" which does nothing to negate the value of this thread. It just proves that Planned Parenthood has used deception in the past and will continue to be deceptive in the future. But my question is this. If PP is simply concerned with offering a medical procedure in order to insure the health and welfare of women, and not the wholesale murder of as many children as possible, why would they see the need to deceive anyone in order to promote their abortions ? "
2601,notsarc,"Yeah, he's absolutely correct. So what's your point? You think you deserve special rights? Are you better than straight people? Are you superior people because your preferred form of sex doesn't allow for pro-creation as God commanded humanity to do? Is this your argument?"
2602,notsarc,"I think the problem is, some people believe that gun control, any gun control, is one step closer to the total surrender of all guns. My belief on this is that every time someone calls for repeal of gun control laws or opposes the new gun control laws, it fuels the anti-gun extremists to call for the total ban on all guns. If we cannot make and enforce common sense gun control laws that both sides can agree on, neither side will ever stop. If a buy back was ever proposed in America, very few guns would be sold. If guns were banned all together, only the law abiding people will give up their guns, and anyone who does not will unfortunately become a criminal."

2604,notsarc,There are ideals in this world that are better left alone.....lines that should not be crossed. Marriage is an ideal that does not need changing; doing so is crossing that line in the sand that was drawn there for a reason.
2605,notsarc,"I believe many of the intellectuals behind the ""pro-life"" movement (and rest assured it is the intellectuals, not the masses, behind any political movement, whether it be pro-life or instigating a communist revolution) are not opposed to abortion per se.   Anti-abortion legislation is simply a tool by which they try to maintain a less sexually permissive society, believing that if women who fall pregnant outside of marriage are forced to endure pregnancy and likely child-raising alone, rather than being offered an easy way out, they will be less likely to have sex outside of marriage.   For this reason any method of contraception poses the same threat to them as abortion does, though some methods may be easier to rally support against than others."
2606,notsarc,"And of course my point was to show that not only do they contribute to political activism but they do it through cover organizations.

In addition, you never asked for a dollar amount in your challenge for evidence, you asked for evidence that gay churches were involved in political activism.

existance of demons.. 
Frankly, those are rather silly superstitions that in my eyes discredit the possiblity of Christiantiy being accurate.

If homosexuality is condemned by god then they cannot marry in gods eyes..keeping up?
If gays cannot marry then gay sex must be outside of marriage therefore it is fornicating.

2702,sarc,"You're deluded, as usual. Anything that doesn't balance the budget is based on LIBERAL THINKING. And you don't balance the budget with massive tax hikes and gutting the military like the liberals are fond of doing. And you're going to vote for liberals? Obama? His latest budget plan was defeated 414-0 in the House. Not even his liberal cohorts would vote for it. And you vote for Obama? What the hell is the matter with you people?"

As Trebor said, the ToE says absolutely nothing about ""your Lord and Saviour"". Innumerous Christians both believe in God and accept the ToE. And as he said, if worshipping YOUR Lord and Saviour requires me to throw reason, facts, common sense, and substantiated science out the window, he and those who want me to worship this ""version"" of him can go suck a monkey's hairy bollocks.

2711,sarc,"Yes, he did avoid the issues important to me, but then, America's electorate contains a lot of religious bigots, so I was not really surprised. I think he was pretty clear where he stood on abortion rights, though. No chance of another bunch of Romish Supreme Court justices, I think.
And if you think Obama is a conservative, can I sell you a bridge in Brooklyn? He's not as liberal as some, and he certainly isn't left wing -- and no, dear, liberal and left are not synonyms, for all you reactionaries like to make the claim they are -- but look at his voting record.

Seriously dude, you're trying to get off on a technicality here. Like a lawyer trying to argue ""Your honor my client isn't a prostitute, she's a female escort"". Doesn't matter what you call it or what you try to pass it off as, a criminal is a criminal regardless of what their formal title is.

2868,sarc,"So lets see, you referred to how the 1st amendment applied to the states, posted the 14th amendment privileges and immunities clause and then asked if I thought something was unclear. Of course the privileges and immunities clause is often mistaken to have incorporated the 1st amendment by people who don't know what they are talking about but this is merely coincidence because you randomly quoted part of the 14th amendment but implied it all. Now if I changed it to what it said above would you feel that is an accurate statement? Probably, considering you don't seem to understand a blatant difference between ""original understanding"" and ""original constitution).
Your pride ruins you my friend.

2869,sarc,"Your problem is that you take the Bible as the Literal Word of the Invisible man which everyone with a brain knows it is NOT. There are other ""Sins' listed in the old testament that you ignore and try to explain away but you know as well as I that Jesus did not change the Laws. If you want others to live by your False book of fairy tales it would be a Good Idea for you to read it and follow it yourself first.

Actually, my ""sick hypothetical"" was a very valid question. I simply asked you if god commanded you to kill your neighbour for his sins, sins which you had no evidence of, would you do it. It seems like a fairly simple, straightforward question to me. Why not answer it?
I see a pattern here Archie. If someone asks you a tough question about your faith, you cry ""Corrupter! Blasphemer!"" and run away. Is this your idea of ""witnessing""? Is your faith that weak?

So your scientific claims are bunk, red herrrings, THAT I HAVE ALREADY RESPONDED TO. If you wish to hang onto one of them DO SO. Continue to debate how chaos theory applies to your claim. We can debate further, but you ignore my response, then come back 5 posts later and misrepresent what I post. STOP.

2978,sarc,"Yes, the Bible tells us that God Himself will prevent Pharaoh from letting the Israelites go, then turn right around and punish Pharaoh by killing his firstborn son! 
But its worse, because God does not kill just Pharaohs firstborn son, but ALL of the Egyptians firstborns!
Oh, but perhaps the Bible just messed up somehow: maybe it doesnt repeat that God hardened Pharaohs heart. Nope. The Bible says it MULTIPLE times.
"
2979,sarc,"Wow, Archie actually admits that angels do have free will. That makes a change.
But then he goes and spoils it again by saying that they don't really have free will, but describes grace instead. He has a habit of redefining stuff.

3069,sarc,Sounds like I got the better deal. Maybe you should have held your pre-printed sign higher so the cameras could read ALL of it. ;)
3070,sarc,"I don't understand your outrage. McChrystal's your boy's general now. Are you saying that you disagree with ""the Great One""?"
3071,sarc,"And this equates to starvation how? Only in the Kitty Genovese case does that equate. On the other hand if you went to Somalia you might find starvation if they had death certificates. 
By the way your figures come from the census and guess work baby."
3072,sarc,"Better still , you pop down to your local army barracks and explain it to thememoticonXClown"
3073,sarc,"Ah yes, the 'Let's pull a smug and self serving quote out of context from the bible and use it as in insult, therefore god exist' routine. That arrogant method of using self congratulatory bible quotes to insult and denigrate your opponent is neither an effective debate technique, or does it help convince those people on the boarder line to convert to Christianity. It does drive them away, so please, be my guest and keep on trying to use it. I figure the ratio of people you drove away from Christianity to those people who were converted to Christianity from you must be way lop sided."
3074,sarc,LOL! That's a great intellectual argument! Slackers and Social Evolution. emoticonXClown

3079,sarc,"You're full of folly. When you've been shown specifics in the past you casually sluff them off like your used elevator shoes.
There's no educating stiff-necked numbskulls like you people."
3080,sarc,"perhaps you would like to explain simplistic.
Is the anthropic principle simplistic?
What natural law created natural law?
Where did the information come from?
Is matter creating matter simplistic? Matter creating information?
Here;s a deep thought:
If matter created the Universe what if it changes it's mind! emoticonXRolleyes"
3081,sarc,"Then since you are so convinced that this is going to happen. Please provide us with a detailed time table with accurate dates and people involved.
Then again if it is true then you will be united and form a bond with your husband Jesus. Since as a christian and a member of the church and the church is the bride of Jesus. You will be married to Jesus so actually we win since you will be in a same sex marriage with Jesus yourself one day."

So...are you offering to give up your computer and the electricity that runs it? Do you have a list of those 'consumer goods' that you want to ban from civilization?
You still don't get it - people need jobs and right now those jobs consist of making consumer goods. What % of the population do you want to cull so that the global unemployment rate doesn't create a society of thieving savages?emoticonXDonno"
3089,sarc,"I already have, hence the explanation I provided. If you challenge me to show you an error then I will. Did you expect me to try and show something that was true and see if I could convince you it wasn't? 
When you post your evidence it usually has holes in it, not always but the truth is funny that way. It is very difficult sometimes to cover it up.

You have a spare tire just in case? Just in case of a car accident? In case your engine explodes? In case someone hijacks your car?
Congratulations, Winston. You have made by far the most asinine post I have ever seen. And you are the most asinine person I have ever seen.

3096,sarc,"No, quite clearly you are wrong, he is saying Countless people, facing persecution the world over - people living and those as yet unborn"". ""And"" those that are not born yet. Can you not read? He includes them with the ""AND"". Why do you think he spent his life protecting the unborn and children? You ought to read what it says. Furthermore, the human rights act, specifically talks about protecting the unborn too. You lose"

All the best."

Then why didnt he simply have his military kill the revolutionists?You want some evidence that Carter abandoned the Shah?http://rescueattempt.tripod.com/id24.htmlI would print parts of that link but there are just two many FACTS presented. Read a few and see if you can dismiss them with something like you did before."

3104,sarc,"Plain with the benefit of hindsight. I love how you're able to determine, not having been there, precisely what was said and precisely where it fell in relation to the law. If it was so clear, we'll see the prosecution for wrongful arrest in due course, I'm sure."
3105,sarc,"Sorry, jack, but I've already crossed over unto eternal life (John 5:24).
You're in big trouble, though:

3106,sarc,"other jobs are ok also.
all the women who are in the army...they manned up. grew penises is what they did."
3107,sarc,This is begging so many darn quesions it's boggling my mind!
3108,sarc,"Yea I guess you're right, you people tend to blur together after a time."
3109,sarc,"So now gays don't exist? The anti-marriage side has reached a new low! Denying the existance of a what they are aruging aganist! I didn't think you guys could go that low. I was sadly mistaken. 
"
3110,sarc,"Then you must have expected him to be a mute on the show. He was basically just there; he made no worthy comments. It was so bad he had to resort to an emotional hypothetical. He made no sense, and that comment had no part in the interview. Bush doesn't send kids to Iraq. First of all they volunteer. Second of all, they are older than 18. Please let me know what comments Michael Moore made that you thought were worthy. You might have trouble.
"
3111,sarc,"Then you would want me to be something god did not create me to be? Silly, I 'd say! Humans are part of the animal kingdom. Mammals if I remember from biology. Are you not an animal? If not, maybe the mothership will come and pick you up soon."
3112,sarc,This is often called: 'talking out of both sides of your mouth'
3113,sarc,"Most people would not know if there was a gay person showering next to them at the gym.
Other than that big gay ID card and maching toaster oven that we carry everywhere, that is ... :p"

3119,sarc,"I always have to chuckle whenever I see somebody claim that homosexuality is a choice.
Even in this day and age, it's astounding that people still believe that.
Quite frankly, I consider that to be the biggest LIE that the religious right groups put out there.
There is NO debate in scientific or medical communities on the issue. NONE whatsoever.
There is NO REASON to believe homosexuality is a choice.
Yet some people still claim it is.
You might as well be claiming that the moon is made of green cheese..."
3120,sarc,"How many times have the ""evangelicals"" been ""so worried"" about what gay kids and gay parents are doing???
Do you ever wonder why the ""family"" groups are ""so worried"" about them for when they report endlessly on their actions?

3121,sarc,"Actually that was obvious based on your type of irrational reasoning.
"
3122,sarc,"I want to know how giving her abusers more reason to abuse her makes sense too.

3123,sarc,"So, no actual source. And Hannity and Colmes? Yeesh, you might as well quote Limbaugh or Coulter or O'Reilly. They're all equally ""fair and balanced"".

Gay lifestyle is fuelled by drugs, research reveals | Society | The Observer
""'The gay scene is bar and club orientated,' said Monty Moncrieff, project co-ordinator at Antidote, a drugs service for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. 'That is where people go to meet other gay people and there is a lot of cocaine, ecstasy, ketamine and GHB around. It is a hedonistic culture and often the lifestyle and recreational drug use go hand in hand.'""

Every time a child is born, it's different than both parents. That's evolution. Change. Are you suggesting some mythological god had a role, or are you you a little more advanced and understand how human reproduction works on a basic level?
Bacteria, a better example, can actually swap genetic material, and ""evolve"" rapidly, without even needing to go through a sexual reproductive cycle.

3392,sarc,"True until proven otherwise eh? Xcaliber and you must get along great.
You have things backward and you are probably being confused by the 'experiment to falsify a theory', that is a tenet of science based on the generalization that untrue theories are easily disproved.
No logician (and by extension no good scientist) would ever hold a lack of disproof as proof.
Oh right theories are never proven, so in fact your definition of theory would go something like this -> 'an idea that is not disproved which we assume is true'.

3514,sarc,"You're pulling my leg, right? I've been hiring scientists for well over 20 years now and you're going to pull up a wiki reference, that I can edit myself, to prove me wrong? emoticonXWow
Tell me, have you ever met an engineer or a scientist? Have you ever seen the curricula that they take or do you just pull statements from your posterior?

3521,sarc,Jyoshu - you think anytime a homosexual engages in anything but hiding in the closet and keeping their mouths shut is a gay rights movement. The kids are jerks.
3522,sarc,So a gun is a fire hazard in a public place? I gotta say the gun haters are getting more creative with their arguments.

3524,sarc,And yet we're still waiting for your mental condition to finally hit you like a ton of bricks.... Denial is the usual reaction...
3525,sarc,Well that lets out most of the supreme court when RvW comes up! And of course 1/2 give or take of the voters would be disqualified if relevant issues come up to a vote. Perhaps we should start an effort to amend the constitution to incorporate your idea!
3526,sarc,"Sorry, I hadn't realised your one-man legislature had passed a law forbidding discussion of equal protections. I'll discuss what I damn well please.
"
3527,sarc,"I know. Sad indeed. Orion and his liberal ilk make it a habit to come up with these sophomoric ideas. As if Jesus (who is God according to Scripture) would come out and give Moses the commandments against gay sex and then turn around and incarnate as a gay man. Get real. When the antichrist comes he'll probably be gay (one OT scripture alludes to the antichrist as having no affinity for women, and Satan loves to mimic God's kingdom with some kind of diabolical twist.). Then Orion will prostrate himself before him and receive him as his long lost savior."
3528,sarc,"Nice spin. Would you have preferred ""the civilized world"" instead? Or Western Civilization or Gay Western Civilization? Your preference? One case in 1959 isn't a pandemic.

Is this one of the tactics you fundies frequently practice? Change the subject when you are about to lose?"
3537,sarc,"Not only is Phyllis right in calling you what you are but you clearly ignore reality. You were already called on using incorrect facts once...you might as well say ""denying abortion will cause 10000000 bagillion deaths a day"""
3538,sarc,"You do realize you just disproved your own basic points yes? 
The pictures you posted are falsified because abortion clinics and small health clinics contract out to places to have their medical waste incinerated. 
Good job on failing to realize you just proved Cunx correct."

3549,sarc,"OK, and this point I'm going to have to go with ""Functionally handicapped"" for $200 Alex.
Go back, reread Ethmi's OP. The question was-why aren't people working to get alcohol and tobacco banned since they are responsible for more deaths than guns. And, as I and others have pointed out about a dozen damn times already, the entire question is flawed as a gun's sole purpose is to kill, while alcohol and tobacco kill as a side effect through overindulgence. And there is also the fact that you cannot point a cigarette or bottle of JD at someone and kill them.

Just some parting unfriendly advice

3559,sarc,"Bollocks. Using a definintion that you agree with is NOT part of the debate. Arguing from personal incredulity is all of your handwaving and assertions amounts to. Use the real definition, not a wishy washy one that happens to alighn itself with your delusion.
"
3560,sarc,"If jesus said 'Make correct Judgments"", IMO you have failed miserably.
He is also alledged to ahve said 'He who is without sin cast the first stone.
I guess that with all the stones you are casting, you consider yourself without sin."
3561,sarc,"Wow what a lovely christian setaments and attitudes. I wonder what Jesus would say about his number one fan after a statements of hate as the ones above.
"
3562,sarc,"Hey Jitobaby - if you're that insecure with your beliefs that you have to throw this kind of a snit when people are making a case contrary to your failed radical liberalism, then maybe you need to watch Michael Moore on TV instead of reading my posts."

3581,sarc,"Then you have no problems about people reminding you about how the US has screwed up in the past causing the deaths of thousands? Or how about the US overthrowing democracies in Latin America and installing dictatorships?
Of course those will be used in a arguments completely irrevelant to them, but considering how you keep using the WWII fallacy to distract the discussion away from your own failure, you shouldn't have any problem no?"

3588,sarc,"Thanks for that rant against religion.
You may think its relevant but I dont particularly think it is.
Its not only religious people that do not like gays.
They need better PR than comparing gay prejudice to racial prejudice.
They could learn from black people with their role models though, MLK,Muhammad Ali and Paul Robeson are far better than Liberace and George Michael."
3589,sarc,I am still waiting for you to tell me why the gay priests only molested boys.......It has to do with how they are physically contructed.........
3590,sarc,"Thats where you are wrong ..again.

3599,sarc,"Yep, Martha is in trouble and the democrats are panicking.

3665,sarc,I am curious as to how you determine whos middle class on this forum. Do you have a crystal ball or simply discern peoples classes based on whether they agree with you or not?
3666,sarc,"Is your thinking really this simplistic? Either I have to agree with you or I am an anarchist? Is that all the complexity you can handle? This or that? Black or white? The best soda in the world is Sprite and everything else is wrong? What a boring little pigeon-holed world you live in.

I can only collect SS if I pay into the system. My employer AND I pay for my family's healthcare.

'Love' has nothing to do with it.
It is the Christian commandment that:
24 Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. 
You have yet to admit that this verse exists but, it seems that you are justifying it on the condition that 'love' is involved.
What you mean to say is, 'Women are to submit to their husbands in everything because their husbands supposedly love them.'
Or, are you saying that men are to love their wives and submission is optional?

3791,sarc,Whatever you sound like a goverment offical now why so many questions? huh what are you trying to get at? Ooaman or should I said Order of apostrophe man?
3792,sarc,"ah yes.....""Gaytheist,"" the terminal homosexual atheist liar at various forums such as IIDB and Tweb misrepresents me to some guy who studies tadpoles. The little XXXX liar atheist claimed to the author that I used his paper as ""evidence"" of lamarckism -- which was a bold-face lie that she couldn't back up when I pressed her on it. This was merely his response to her strawman lie. Funny how you must repeat these lies to help cover up how pathetic your theory is."
3793,sarc,"An objective test? Wow! Tell me, how do you prove this test is a true useful test? Please don't tell me reason or yet another objective test.

3795,sarc,Yes...I think I would agree with you. That's what happens when you have superstition coupled with self-imposed ignorance I suppose. It's a shame!
3796,sarc,"I do recognise the truth, but you know nothing of it.
When I hit the other side I'll be in the ground, rotting just like you will be, though I suspect the earth round you will be somewhat more bitter."
3797,sarc,"Stalin died of natural causes while in power, I believe. Perhaps the fall of communism is due in part that the purges stopped. So, killing hundreds of thousands of people was wise for Stalin, huh? Good. Good. Anybody disagree with canadianman76?"
3798,sarc,"Again he was under attack. Listen to yourself. And talk about a parrot? 
No one is arguing Saddam was a saint. But he wasn't and threat and he wasn't insane enough to commit sucide. You are too busy being a lemming and being led over the cliff with president Shrub (Molly Irvins -- GW is to small to be a Bush). ;)"

3800,sarc,"Let me know when we're leaving, cause your right and I could use a shot of the real human condition."
3801,sarc,"Maybe you aren't aware, but something that hasn't happend but has a possibility or probability of happening is potential, so the word is accurate to describe it. And since I'm sure Steeeeve (the dictionary worshipper) will step in, here is the definition:

3802,sarc,"Could it be that you don't know what the term strict constructionist means? Even so, Phyllis doesn't seem to be one and I am not. Orginialist is not ""strict constructionist"".

3805,sarc,"Is this another attempt of yours to paint all that believe in smaller, less-intrusive government as loonies? Very transparent, sorry. :("
3806,sarc,"You do that, and be sure to use it when I repeatedly and ignorantly claim that the unborn are parasites while refusing to actually prove it as ingus has done here. Unless you too are making that claim also, then I would make the same challenge to you."
3807,sarc,"My thoughts are my own, not from some 2000 year old Book that makes as much sense as a bag of Rocks. And I have only ever called anyone a name in response to an attack on me,

3809,sarc,That's an attempt to argue that one can't know the truth. The mere fact people disagree doesn't meant that there is no correct answer. I'm amazed you would come up with such 'logic'.
3810,sarc,"Nice try, but no cigar. I never said that inflation had no effect. Of course it does. But even factoring in the alleged 500% inflation since the 1960s or whatever it happens to be depending on calculation does not account for the huge run-up in the price of crude to nearly $80 not that long ago. My beef has been the resident ""experts"" here who flout their supposed knowledge and money to impress us lesser mortals who reminded them of the iron law of supply and demand. That, by the way, is found in Economics 101. But you knew that, didn't you?
So now, it's a ""technical"" correction. What's next? Some wisdom from Joe Granville or the Elliot Wave Theory?

It's no wonder that they aren't noticed when they go missing.
What ever happened for the shepherd going out and seeking his lost sheep to bring them back to the fold???
As to this case.
I mentioned earlier about Rick Warren (author of A Purpose Driven Life)...he doesn't have armed guards in his mega church.
But, then again, he's not a fleecing WofF in shepherds clothing who seeks to ravenously devour a flock."
3815,sarc,"So you are equating pigs with humans. Pig rights! Yes that is logical. We should value a farm animal the same as your kids.
What basis are you using to rationalise such equality? You did have a point, right?

(And you accuse me of not having a teacher's mentality as I educate you in something you didn't previously know... How pathetic.)

So, in sum, your conclusion here, like your conclusions in so many other areas, is simply wrong."
3821,sarc,"Obviously because they're not chickens yet XD 
Oh wait they're chicken EGGS right *thinks* no matter they have absolutely nothing to in common with chickens they're some freaky alien species!

Are you being dense on purpose? I said that I'm not all into the semantics of baby/fetus. I'll conceid that its killing a baby. The TERM for it is fetus, fetus' become babies. I see the logic there (in fact I think I'm agreeing with you). Why must you keep pounding this drum?

3858,sarc,Are you serious? Man I thought you actually had a brain in that dense hollow cranium of yours. You do realize there are Straight Atheists and GAY Christians right Gans?

But I congratulate you for finally admitting that this is a trolls thread. That is more than I expected from you. And as for me reinforcing your contention about conditional christian love ?

Do I have some deep seated delusional fantasy or something like that. You seem to be wise and all knowing( maybe all powerfull as well). Yep, im convinced you are a legend in your own mind. You believe what you will, and I will do the same, and in the end we will see who is right and who is not."

So now mental existence isn't good enough (as it is not unique which was my point) but human cells is important and something of a human brain. Well what importance are human cells and a human brain? It seems the idea of a human having importance is not just limited to me...you just happen to add another criteria at the end that you feel is important as well."
3873,sarc,"Asked and answered. You need to get my claims right before you try to rephrase them. It appears often that some posters here do nothing more than learn from each other how to misrepresent someone else's argument. You move to the front of the class.
I am not anti-gay. Gays can have more rights than I for all I care. I've not claimed that gays should have fewer or different sets of rights. They can be had without changing the definition of marriage. This thread is not about marriage.

So, Abraham Lincoln, how dare you try and impose your own personal moral code on me.

We want you around because we think you are fun."

"
4070,sarc,"Actually, from where this non-believer sits, Arch is merely repeating what the Christian bible says about who will get into heaven and who won't.
There is a difference...
But, you'd have to actually know what the bible says to understand that...
Which is often something most non-believers don't read...
Of couruse, neither do most self-professing believers.
IMO, taking offense at what the bible says (and many people repeat) is akin to taking offense at a cook book calling for salt in a recipe you'll never eat.
Now, if the cook tries to force you to eat said recipe...then you can take all the offense you want."
4071,sarc,"That is a completely subjective assessment. Thelmoose and Unkerpaulie were already quick to dissociate themselves from any smugness or self righteousness on this very thread.

4073,sarc,"That post is not only off topic, but yet a further example of your being completely out of touch with reality."

And you DON'T speak of what you hope and want when you talk? You do not know, any more than us, what the truth is. However, we very easily DO know that your god is not Jesus Christ, as we know you by the fruits of your actions and statements."
4079,sarc,"Rofl, you would still have a problem with that, don't lie.
After all, OMG THEY HAVE BENEFITS YOU DON'T GET OMG. And that's unconstitutional isn't it, Matthew S. At least according to your flawed reasoning."
4080,sarc,"No EasyRidden.. It's you right wing fundies who have attempted for years to rewrite history to fit your religion into our constitution. America is a nation which has always had a population of christians, but it was never a Christian nation. The Words God, Jebus, Holy Spirit.. are NOT included in any of the founding documents. You can continue to ignore the history, you're the one looking like a buffoon."

Many of the real adults have you on their ignore list, for your tendency to accuse everything, prove nothing, and use cheap shots and insults whenever possible. The fact that the only real argument you have against me is the fact that physically I'm a bit younger than you, proves that you have been defeated long ago, yet you insist on continuing to slander and insult me in order to make yourself look good.

4222,sarc,"Good point here, because the media never insults right-wingers....emoticonXRolleyes 
I don't think anybody is denying that Imus' comments were tasteless and offensive. The point that is being made here is that he has the right to make such comments. He didn't discriminate against anyone. He simply said something stupid. If this is going to be considered a crime, we would all be locked away."
4223,sarc,"The point that seemingly escapes you is that not even in the most wonderful country on the planet in all of human history has free speech been considered an absolute right that nothing can limit in any way.

4236,sarc,"Hey - you're the one who condones sinful, illicit gay-sex sodomy, which God himself calls a perversion, so you're the one who is spiritually and historically challenged. You're right in step with Satan, though, so you can really feel proud of that. LOL!

"
4238,sarc,"So, once again, the lack of criminal prosecution isn't due to the red herring that you claim, but rather the incompetence of the Justice Department. Franken's bill doesn't have a provision for making the Justice Department do its job, does it?"

Thank G-d I live in Texas!!! Those facists states are already failed states so it is semantics anyway when the slaves get restless. criminals are a tyrants wanna be best friend.
Everyone should know by now that the cops have no duty to defend anyone no matter the excuses...you are on your own. Everyday I read about the predator leos preying on the electorate so which is worse?"

4246,sarc,Interesting that you would make such a judgement when you are guilty of the same. Or do you need to reread Matthew 7 ?

If you call your diktat, ""productive dialogue"", then you must be employed by 'The Department of Truth', or whatever they're calling it these days. And since to you ""scientific"" means, solely and only, ""materialist/mechanist"", right from the jump, there never was any chance of 'dialogue' taking place.
"
4258,sarc,"Yes but its like sharks when there is blood in the water. Plus I at least do this for fun and why should I not get in my own ideas and have my fun with creationists. They are getting pretty rare you know. Can't let those other rationalists keep them all to themselves. emoticonXAgree

4291,sarc,"So it's alright for a Evo to insult you and go off on a tangent, and expect to get answer. What's the point in answering if your being mocked, before you give answer. Now I know why there are few Creo's on this forum."

4294,sarc,"About a third of the weapons seized in Mexico were referred to the U.S. for tracing; approximately 11,000 out of 29,000.   About half were successfully traced. Better than 90% of those to U.S. dealers.   Of course your definition of ""minute"" might differ from mine."
4295,sarc,"Pathetic, why would you let anyone besides yourself determine who you call family? Nobody is forcing their religion on you. Nobody is even saying who you can or can't get married to. What is being said is that you, or anyone else, doesn't have the ""right"" to have that marriage recognized by gov't. Universal recognition by gov't doesn't even happen in hetro marriages. Nowhere in the founding documents of this nation does it say ""All gov't entities shall recognize all people's marriages"". Since we have ""a government for the people by the people"", the duties of government not spelled out in the founding documents are determined by the people. You have the freedom to vote your beliefs and so does everybody else."
4296,sarc,"What do I have against abortion? Hmmm, let me think. I guess there is that little fact that it is MURDER! But besides that ""opinion"", it does effect me because it effects society in a negative way. Do you just choose to ignore the studies on the terrible emotional and physical problems women have after they have abortions? Look here to see what I mean. Do a search for ""effects of abortion"" on the Web and see if you don't find many more studies with the same results. I could have posted many more links. Maybe you don't know about these studies since the leftist media and women's groups tends to ignore them. Maybe you just ignore them because they don't fit into your world view. Either way, the facts are there."
4297,sarc,"Like evolution, right? You have your conclusion, so everything else must adhere to it. Just answer the question. How to you account for the statements above?"
4298,sarc,"You were asked to give us your explanation of evolution. So far you've just regurgitated creationist arguments against it, without showing that you actually understand what you're arguing against. But instead of trying to answer the question that was asked of you, you just spat out some more quotes. The least you could have done was to use quotes that explained evolution as you percieve it, but they're not even on topic, going on about morality and atheism! You continue to confirm your ignorance for us."
4299,sarc,Really. Have you got any quotes from them endorsing monopolies?
4300,sarc,"There is the potential for a human that comes out of many, crude and vulgar things. Some end up on a maxi pad or when a guy reaches for the box of Kleenex. Should I feel a special bond with the conceptions rudely flushed out because they couldn't make it to the uterine wall? They had the potential, the DNA, were once a life too, and made a valiant effort. Life is constantly in motion. We don't value all life, or maybe not all life the same. When it appears to have some aspects of human personhood, this would seem like a logical marker, where we'd place greater value."

Does this maniac think to himself "" I hope I can get that licsense so I can kill a bunch of people""."
4307,sarc,"So the Establishment Clause was included to promote atheism, eh?"
4308,sarc,"oh, it's obvious that non-darwinists have no affect on you guys. Nothing will ever change your mind because your mind is not made up on the evidence...it's made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism."

4310,sarc,"So, how many unborn babies did your God drown in Genesis? Talk about hypocrisy."
4311,sarc,"Yippie doo! A 23 year old quote from an ornithologist defending his point of view. And his point of view has (or had) merit. But since then, several feathered dinosaurs (not birds) have been found. It has also been shown that the difference between a scale and a feather may be no more than a single point mutation. (You do know what I'm talking about, don't you Calli? You do know what a ""point mutation"" is, don't you?) Bottom line is that there may be no intermediate between scales and feathers. A single point mutation produces feathers from scales. Various kinds of feathers require only further mutation."

4335,sarc,"Like they said in the article, you can have a campaign against marrige because it hurts women because of domestic abusers, you can say the baseball hurts men, because many of them get hurt. But most of the time its a great thing. Why then, would you suggest something so abusrd as to abortion hurts women. Most of the time, abortion lets women let go of that big weight thats holding them back and prusue their dreams, and live a happy life. Since when has AntiAbortionists cared about women?

Most educated creationists not only admit evolution, they propose evolution at rates that make real biologists laugh."
4341,sarc,So are you saying that the people of India aren't upset about what happened and how the police chose to hide instead of engage the enemy and thus let hundreds of people be violently murdered? Are you saying that the people of India aren't seeking changes so they can arm themselves accordingly so if something like this happens again they'll be better prepared to handle it?
4342,sarc,So you admit that the bible should be kept out of the hands of children? Is my statement about the bible somehow false? Is the brutal torture and murder of Jesus not glorified in the bible?

4373,sarc,"I know this may seem obvious to most people, but it seems to have escaped the notice of creationists. Birds are tetrapods, as are amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Birds didn't just grow wings. Wings are adaptions of the front limbs that were covered with feathers. Perhaps you are unaware of the evidence that indicates that maniraptors had feathers, probably for thermoregulation. Saying that there is no mechanism for birds to grow wings when they previously had none is like saying that there is no mechanism for mankind to grow arms when he previously had none. You see, mankind's closest relatives are the two species of chimpanzee - they are quadrupeds."
4374,sarc,"So what you're saying is that by mentioning both in the same post, I'm saying that unless someone is a YEC then they aren't a christian? Because that is what you attributed to me. Yet you have yet to post evidence of me saying that to anyone. Nor have you supported your original claim here, you said this: Last I checked, no credible fossil fuel firm hired YEC geologists. Prove this assertion since you researched it thoroughly enough to start a thread about."
4375,sarc,And there is still no evidence on the table for YEC.
4376,sarc,"Rather unsurprisingly, the U.S. constitution does not have any bearing on Australian law."
4377,sarc,"Cute. And I can come up with about 5,000 to 7,000 examples that do have a bright orange muzzle."
4378,sarc,I see. Sounds too nebulous to stand up to scrutiny in the US. I'm guessing that the SCOTUS would strike down such as law as being too vague.
4379,sarc,And you remind me of the people in the year 1900 who said man would never be able to build a flying machine.
4380,sarc,Well that's a stupid statement. Stupid enough that I can't even wrap my head around it and make a proper comparison.
4381,sarc,"Just like it's the job of the gun control lobby to try and pass an overwhelming, unreasonable level of fear of an inanimate object?"
4382,sarc,"That's military snipers, not for what passes for elite police in the land of the fruits and nuts. SEALS, Marines and Army for the most part."
4383,sarc,"Is this a rational statement? If so, prove it rationally, by science."
4384,sarc,"If you weren't a newbie, you'd know that I was anti-abortion."
4385,sarc,By your own admission you haven't 'hung out' with stoners for a while and you're making generalisations about them to people who do spend a lot of time with stoners?
4386,sarc,No - but they certainly have a bias. As do we all.
4387,sarc,Don't you get tired of passing of just-so statement as argument?
4388,sarc,"All of them since I don't know what quotes you are referring to at all. Link to the post you are speaking about if you can. OK? Otherwise, I see no reason to respond to anymore of your drivel at all."
4389,sarc,"Well he can defend his tax difficulties by claiming he is a creationist and thus cannot be trusted with quantitative processes involving a bit of mathematics. Then again he can tell IRS that GOD will provide and they should contact Bush to get Gods cell number. I am sure that IRS, GOD, and Hovind can work it all out."
4390,sarc,I notice its typos and mispellings that attract slim jim. Not much on the meat and taters of postings. It does get the other country leftists jumping ugly when they see we can purchase so many firearms freely. The pious wringing of hands and croc tears over the murder rate here versus the rate some where else is unbelieveable. Instead of blaming XXXX poor police work and a joke of a criminal justice system it has to be lack of gun control.
4391,sarc,"I suppose Piltdown Man was the product of newspapers, cute indeed!"
4392,sarc,"So according to you, you'd prefer it if only the bad guys are armed, because that makes it easy to tell who's the bad guy and who's the good guy; being the good guy is never armed, and thus never able to defend themselves."
4393,sarc,Really? Can you cite those sources? I am sure that you will be citing the literature rather than creationist web sites.
4394,sarc,I was eight at the time. I'll read up and get back to you. Mind your manners.
4395,sarc,"It appears that peddler is finally open to learning new things! (Unless, of course, peddler is simply being facetious... which is not obvious from the immediate context.)"
4396,sarc,"No doubt Matthew! We just have this lust for killing gays. Wow, you really nailed it. We actually are pretty well organized to. Darth Vader is the president of the VA chapter for example. We soon plan on launching a weapon that actually seeks out gays....not that this matters because anyone we don't like we put in the camps.   We have a national meeting in a few months in Montana. Maybe if you wear a black robe and do the secret handshake they won't know you are gay so then you can attend. We have really good food at these events."
4397,sarc,Over the Internet that can be a particularly difficult call...
4398,sarc,You mean like a tapeworm? Should removing tapeworms be illegal too?
4399,sarc,I believe they got XXXXXX at all the conservates on this board. So they went and joined a commie discussion board where they feel more welcome and can send congrats to each other for being smarter than regular people.
4400,sarc,"So in other words, you're saying that somewhere along the lines, God changed his mind."
4401,sarc,"An immaculately presented response, entirely avoiding the topic, or indeed reason, in order to unwittingly further the case for retrospective abortion."
4402,sarc,"Why doesn't this apply to Soviet Russia - which had a population of similar size ? Presumably, your answer would be that the USSR was less ""developed"" than the US ?"
4403,sarc,"1984, huh? I'm sure that is all still very relevant. Actually there is a lot of discussion about the nature of Archaeopteryx. Much of it deals with whether it could fly and what it teaches us about how birds came to fly - ground up or trees down. But what they all agreed on, even back then, was that Archaeopteryx is a transitional. Taxonomic debates aren't really very meaningful, really. Creationists like to make a big deal about the fact that most taxonomists and ornithologists classify Archaeopteryx as a bird. But where else would it go? That's a limitation of the Linnean classification system - everything is put somewhere, even if it doesn't exactly fit. The only debate about the evolution of Archaeopteryx among experts is whether it evolved from theropod dinorsaurs or from archosaurs. It's still a transitional."
4404,sarc,"I think it is hilarious that you still think that in order to do a detailed study of evolution, you have to read 10 different books on it and take brainwashing classes from a university. Maybe you just like making yourself feel superior to me...who knows..."
4405,sarc,Hollow bones however when equipped with wings allow for greater flight distance.
4406,sarc,Well good at least you are aware there is no reason beyond your opinion of morality against gay marriage. So by all means don't marry a man and the problem is solved.
4407,sarc,"Perfect. A creationists caught repeating the same refuted arguments on different forums. Resistance is met, run like a coward to another forum."
4408,sarc,"Is that the entire Pro-Choice objection? Is that the whole Pro-Choice argument? Does it really boil down to a question of pregnancy versus death, rather than slavery versus death? If so, I am Pro-Life."
4409,sarc,"For one to have evolution as their foundation belief, means that one cannot be certian of anything....."
4410,sarc,So on what day did he create time on. Its not mentioned anywhere in the biblical text which seems to simply assume time.
4411,sarc,"Where in Canada is it illegal to defend yourself with a firearm, given sufficient threat?   And what did the Indians do to the Brown's to justify using deadly force?"
4412,sarc,"Wow, make up your mind. Either populations change over time (evolve) or they don't.   Would your wingless beetles be able to produce wings again if they were somehow beneficial again? You are starting to sound like Darwin and his finches."
4413,sarc,And you have a right to cling to superstition and magic as true. But that doesn't make mythology true.
4414,sarc,According to Genesis? Why are you trying to present that as scientific evidence? Should I present The DaVinci Code as scientific evidence? How about Darwin's On the Origin of the Species?
4415,sarc,"And you can be described as a ""pre-dead corpse"" as well. Histrionic revisionist linguistics only serve to push some form of dishonesty agenda that can not stand by itself on the facts. It is the coward's route. Are you a coward???"
4416,sarc,"No, actually, we don't.   I suppose it's pointless to ask someone who would speak for God to not tell me what I know."
4417,sarc,I think it best not to jump to conclusions about things you don't know. Before you were saying that Bloomberg didn't even have a right to complain about what happens in other cities in New York. Now you're complaining that Bloomberg isn't doing enough to interfere in what goes on in other states.
4418,sarc,You mean your hypothetical I presume? Murder violates the rights of the murdered by relieving them of their life. That's why it's illegal.   You're a bit slow I see.
4419,sarc,The same bogus argument wrapped up in a new package. GAY MARRIAGE DESTROYS MARRIAGE!! DESPITE THE FACT THAT YOU cAN STILL MARRY WHOMEVER YOU WANT. DUHHHHHHHHHH rocket sience here.
4420,sarc,well that could happen if somhow you mutated into some..i dunno...600 armed person. ?
4421,sarc,didn't Kevin Costner do a movie about this in 1995?
4422,sarc,Other than the Soldini firearms were purchased legally there is no proof that he had a concealed carry permit. If he had the AP and the rest of the left-tard media (redundancy alert) would still be shouting it from the roof tops. Just because the Brady bunch-VPC says so doesn't make it true. Then what else can we expect from a self confessed torturer of helpless small animals and arsonist?
4423,sarc,"According to Stalin, only your caretaker, the USSR, can take away your life.   God has alot in common with dictators. And often the apologists for dictators have alot in common with apologists such as yourself."
4424,sarc,"Can cause aggression, does not mean that it will though. Alcohol has a far greater record of this but yall are not trying to ban that. So do women but we arent going to ban them now are we, Sorry but I was in a marriage from hell and just had to throw that in."
4425,sarc,"Well if you already know you're for guns, then you should know the basic reasons, right? Or was this an uninformed decisions (I heard from my friend that guns are good)? But basically other people have said it. They're protected by the Constitution, they generally result in lower crime rates, and they can be used for defense as well as hunting. Oh, but the burden of proof isn't on the people supporting guns, but those who wish to ban guns. Most arguments for banning guns are easily refutable."
4426,sarc,"Leave it to a leftist to cite a leftist forum for evidence that a leftist agenda is supported by dedicated leftists. Go figure, huh? This post just proves that attempting to reason with such an irrational thinker is truly a waste of time and effort."
4427,sarc,"I don't know about you..but being shot in the back is more human than being taken apart piece by piece. If I recall correctly, Chinese inmates sentenced to death are executed this way to minimize the pain."
4428,sarc,"Oh, and keep your lie - I mean, explanation - consistent with your entire post!"
4429,sarc,Like the crazy idea the Earth goes around the Sun.
4430,sarc,"Fundies don't say do as I say, not as I do. We say do as God says, not as I do. There's a huge difference."
4431,sarc,"So we should wait till the blastocyst is definitely a tumour, in case it turns into a fetus?"
4432,sarc,"Oh, sorry, I didn't think that was a serious answer. Thanks."
4433,sarc,"with tens of millions of gun owners, and hundreds of millions of guns in the US, and you think the guns are still the problem...."
4434,sarc,Old habits die hard and dogs don't pay attention to clocks!
4435,sarc,But then of course nearly every idea not your own generates a DUH from you. As in DUH why use data.
4436,sarc,"Oh, well, then that settles the argument doesn't it. It must be a person because she says so, now. Maybe she will change her mind again?"
4437,sarc,"I thought you had vowed never to post in this forum again. ????? I suppose with your views on divorce, your wedding vows have as much weight as your vow not to post here."
4438,sarc,"I see -- in your opinion is it is ""illegitimate"", therefore it must be so. I think I trust the legal opinions of the courts more, but then, they do occasionally make mistakes. It's just not at all obvious they've made one in this instance."
4439,sarc,And the UN seems to feel it's necessary to spell out that you have the right to marry and have a family.
4440,sarc,And posts like yours serve no purpose other than to detract from the subject at hand. The subject at hand involves how some people choose to fear the law-abiding and feel safer with the law-breakers. You've done absolutely nothing to dispute these facts and prove them wrong.
4441,sarc,"Actually, it makes sense only to you. If you look at nature for just a little while, you willl become aware of a great deal of death. But it is mostly very economical since scavengers make sure that there is minimal waste."
4442,sarc,"Thats nice...Care to make an argument, or are you just op-eding my viewpoints?"
4443,sarc,I'm now slightly less confused about why I've never seen this discussed before.
4444,sarc,"But I thought it was the easy gun laws in the U.S. that made Mexico's cities a shooting gallery? Same as L.A. and less than D.C.?   Amid Drug War, Mexico Less Deadly Than Decade Ago"
4445,sarc,"So, you're just an anti-geologist, anti-cosmologist, anti-archaeologist, anti-physicist, and probably a few more that I can't be arsed to think of right now. *shrugs* Might as well get it over with and just say you're an anti-science religious nutter."
4446,sarc,"It was a troll. Now that we've activated email response, it could take another look or expand some mail list."
4447,sarc,"Well, either the real or imaginary Phyllis implied those things in the post under discussion."
4448,sarc,"You know something is wrong with this world when people attack the act of posting an opinion (that of Ms. King) and another condemns the idea that someone may read it and develop their own opinion. Saving lives is not just a Republican goal. And yes it is an act of desperation. All acts are an act of desperation when it comes to saving the natural process of life with out interference of those who place their comfort above the life inside them.   Whatever is wrong outside the womb, is not the fault of the inhabitant within the womb."
4449,sarc,What difference does it make? Do you only care about frequent killings and choose to ignore isolated incidents? If so doesn't that mean that innocent people dying only interests you when it's in large enough numbers that you can try and exploit them for your own selfish agendas?
4450,sarc,"Translation = ""I've closed my brain off and I've got not nothing."""
4451,sarc,It might be telling that super heroes typically don't use firearms. That I'd prefer my crowds to have few if any guns concealed within hardly makes me pro-crime. Nor does it make me a pacifist. I'm a big fan of violence. The hands on kind.
4452,sarc,You jsut don't get it. You act like two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for lunch. You as a hetero get to go and get married to the person of your choice but I do not. What part of that do you not understand. You say this isn't personal and for you this is true but for me the man I love is nothing but a stranger to me in the eyes of the law. How cruel can you be
4453,sarc,I didn't know that doctors have the constitutional right to perform abortions. What provision in the Constitution guarantees that right?
4454,sarc,"So now name calling and accusations as to my mental health are what you concider as rational thought?   I expect that you must be some sort of expert on warfare, in paticular this war? Am I to believe that you are a soldier there now?   Your rage towards me in your post only shows just how easily upset you are. I posted exactly what I meant to and you went off on a tangent. I asked you for proof and all you can do is a schoolyard tactic if ""show me yours before I show mine?"" Pitiful."
4455,sarc,But how can we make rules without legal lines in sand? At least its better than an illegal line.
4456,sarc,"What part of the Christian worldview? A part of the Christian worldview says stealing is wrong, so you must mean stealing is good? A part of the Christian worldview says rape is wrong, so you must mean rape is good? A part of the Christian worldview says sexual immorality is wrong, so you must mean sexual immorality is good?"
4457,sarc,"Well, maybe the pistol and the hunting rifle, what do you need an automatic weapon? Have the deer gotten faster?"
4458,sarc,"Because of massive cultural differences. You might as well be asking ""if both Americans and British people speak basic english, why do British people refer to apartments as flats?"""
4459,sarc,"Simone, read the sentence again please. It was ""Saving lives is ""not just"" a Republican goal."" It concerns the subject of abortion.   The only way it relates to the politics of Iraq, is that abortionist would rather kill our kids before they get to ""volunteer"" their services for Iraq.   I can't let one statement you made go though. Terrorist continue to terrorize us? Where have they attacked in the U.S. since 9-11? Consider continuing this in an appropriate thread."
4460,sarc,"oh cc, apparently, 10% of the population has the power to destroy the other 90% somehow. We can't be in the military because we have the power to undermine things, we can't get married cause we will destroy marriage for everyone, we cannot possibly have committed relationships because it would make Britney look bad ( although, I have her beat by 4 years and counting, still happy and going) We have the power. We are gay, ten percent taking out the other 90% or so they say (ask jaaman for more info)"
4461,sarc,Oh please... You just refuse to acknowledge anything of a victory for LGBT people.
4462,sarc,"What, to be ""open-minded?"" or to embrace your definition of ""tolerance?"""
4463,sarc,"But in all reality an embryo is inside a uterus, living solely through a placenta and a two month old baby is not. That is a significant difference. One may argue how significant, but it is silly to say the only difference is time."
4464,sarc,"No, God didn't say this BUT thanks for responding to a post that is over 5 years old."
4465,sarc,"Well, if you want to tell the truth, the theory of evolution is NOT a religion, it involves no magical deities, it takes nothing on faith. And since creation involves supernatural forces that are supported by absolutely NO evidence, it is not a scientific theory."
4466,sarc,"Well, it does take some scientific knowledge to understand the evidence for evolution. One doesn't expect Creationists to possess it."
4467,sarc,"Actually the defending of ATF wouldn't do much with regular guns since they have little to do with them. ATFs function is with NFA guns, which you probably know little, or nothing about."
4468,sarc,"Well, I guess you can refuse to see something that's pretty obvious. It's up to you."
4469,sarc,It is impossible to read something that can't be found.
4470,sarc,So now you want to demonstrate that you are also ignorant of the fossil record?
4471,sarc,So do you think that the earth is hundreds of millions of years old?
4472,sarc,Well then the courts must be insane. Because I'm sure there are some gun control laws that they're struck down due to their ineffectiveness.
4473,sarc,So what? He made a statement on guns clearly and was well killed by one in the end...
4474,sarc,Sooooo? What do you think about the Senator's stance on guns? and her concealed hangun?
4475,sarc,And ill continue to have pity for abused and unplanned pregnant women lacking basic healthcare.
4476,sarc,Hush Poseidon! Be a good non-existent God and stay away from the burning bush you'll put it out and then your really be in trouble.
4477,sarc,"Oh, you didn't read the part where he distanced himself from atheism? The one where he explained that evolution is compatible with theism? I guess you missed it... It was only, you know, the vast majority of the book."
4478,sarc,As long as we cut off the privates of the fathers as well.
4479,sarc,"Look again. This time, try and put yourself into the time the Bible was written. Try to see things as they did. Then ask yourself how those scriptures fit into that time period. It's not hard. But you may need to take a few classes on how to analyze historical documents and Hermeneutics before you get it."
4480,sarc,So what you are saying is that the actual purpose of prison is to be raped in the shower by some 400 pound guy called Betty? Or brutalised by a guard with an inferiority complex...and these don't strike you as cruel and unusual?
4481,sarc,And the ability to digest nylon is not a new function?? You seem to have a different conception of 'new function' that what matches with reality.
4482,sarc,"What exactly are the age ranges of these ""children"" in the news stories?"
4483,sarc,"Oh, really?   Translation: the only amendments that rise and fall are the ones that I want to."
4484,sarc,"Compared to what? The U.S.? That would be laughable if it wasn't so serious, it is plain ridiculous. The CDC and NAS studies Tither has posted so many times still hasn't sunk it has it? There is no benefit to any gun control law that has been studied! Now here you are ignoring and contradicting scientific facts...again. Take Chicago, they have strict gun laws and have over 3 times the national rate of murders."
4485,sarc,And I didn't have to choose to be homosexual. It is a natural inclination. I chose not to hide or lie about who I am. However you are the one who seems to be under the delusion that being gay is a choice. Once again I ask you if it is just a choice then you choose to be gay this moment.
4486,sarc,"So put the criminals to death, don't let them see daylight again."
4487,sarc,"I'd love to see an explanation about how the study of the natural world disproves the existence of all Deities. Especially the Deistic Gods. And I'd love to see how science is suppose to disprove a being that is not bound by logic, reason or any laws. What science can do is disprove that God was directly responsible for this or that, the sun rising, the rain season, etc. Did you perhaps realize that many scientists are Buddhists because Buddhism which has beings that behave as Gods with such powers and exist partially within the natural and supernatural? Or are you again assuming all religions don't exist except for Christanity?"
4488,sarc,"""humble ape?"" LOL! Do they keep them in separate cages at the zoo?"
4489,sarc,"Oh, dear. I seem to have lost you again. 'Peer' just means a group of people holding the same biases."
4490,sarc,"Well actually I have not seen your point of view expressed anywhere but on these forums. Seems to me if its rising to ascendancy at least ONE scientist somewhere would have recently at least mentioned it. Quick search reveals NO mentions at all. Of course if you say its displacing NDS then I guess I will have to agree - you being a well known biologist and all, but I remain perhaps a bit irrationaly skeptical."
4491,sarc,"And have a child with a terminal disease and watch them most likely die slowly because of my ""soul mate."" Yeah. I'm thinking if they're willing to make me go through that they're not a soul mate at all. >_>"
4492,sarc,"Your love of assumption is quite amusing (it also highlights your inability to argue honestly). All I did was point out that accidents are a cause of injuries and fatalities dealing with firearms. Nowhere did I suggest banning them in the slightest. Furthermore, I specifically noted that most of the accidents were due to improper gun safety.   So how about you take the stick out of your XXX and stop assuming whatever the **** you want for a change?   You are a joke Isly. About time you admit it."
4493,sarc,"Confirmation records that you were a Christian? Excuse me while I fall out of my chair in uncontrollable fits of laughter. Did your pastor make you sign a paper that said ""I, _________, have proudly become a Christian on ________ __, _____""? Or did they take pictures of you talking to Jesus in the youth room?   Seriously though... no, wait, nevermind. *snicker*"
4494,sarc,Well you never know cause your pro life and for the death penalty.
4495,sarc,"You are SO insulting.   ""Oh, the poor dears have been through too much and are considering an action I disagree with so they must not be thinking clearly.""   Who are you to say they aren't thinking clearly? I'll give it to you, Bassman. You are the most polite, best veiled misogynist I have ever encountered. You nearly had me fooled."
4496,sarc,Funny. Foreigners are always cited when liberals talk about how great gun control is and how much good can come from it.
4497,sarc,"Yes, we should have a speedier route to the needle. If we miss a few, send a few innocent people to their deaths, no harm no foul."
4498,sarc,It's usually easier to take the immoral path. Stealing's easier than working. Lying's easier than telling the truth. Being a deadbeat parent is easier than being a good parent. The list goes on and on.
4499,sarc,"You know, its those happy-smiley cartoons that really freak me out. Is this just me or does anyone else find them creepy?"
4500,sarc,"So if I go out and buy a Brand X car and then regret it a year later, does that mean that nobody should be allowed to go out and buy a Brand X car? Am I entitled to have an opinion and share it with others...sure. However, could others purchase a Brand X car and never regret it...absolutely. Should my negative experience be used to prevent others from engaging in something that they might consider positive? Sounds kinda fascist to me."
4501,sarc,"Tell me then, does someone who is mentally retarded have a self-interest in staying alive? What about someone in a coma?"
4502,sarc,"Well they didn't. That's a nice proclamation, but it's a little late. Perhaps you would fight for better sex education?"
4503,sarc,Really. Some people would think I'm in cahoots with the creationists. I predict their behavior and then they go and do it.
4504,sarc,"A gay person is a homosexual, friend. He can't change that part about himself. He was wired that way. If you don't like the idea of gay sex, then I'd suggest you not participate in gay sex. That's pretty simple. If you don't want gay marriage, then don't get one."
4505,sarc,"Man cannot invent anything that did not already exist in form. Did we invent the wheel, or discover the idea? Did the Wright brothers invent machine powered flight, or was it that they stumbled upon it? In every culture, in every society, man looks to something greater than himself. They simple don't leave it at themselves and be done with it."
4506,sarc,"I get the feeling they have filed under: Plague, Avoid like the."
4507,sarc,"All you have said is there are two apples. I noticed you said describe, I can describe what a chair is, but that description is not the chair itself. Are the apples the ""law of non-contradiction""?"
4508,sarc,Not even Answers in Genesis thinks that these ideas have any credence. But Mr. Kent Hovind still does.
4509,sarc,"Um, recorded and document Anglo/Irish history? The same history that led John Major and Anthony Blair to apologize to the Irish people."
4510,sarc,"Unriggable, your statement should read the so-called ""pro-life"" since they are anything but."
4511,sarc,You mean other than the fact that Mr. Pocketwatch and Mrs. Pocketwatch don't meet up for a night of whoopee and end up with little baby pocketwatches some time later? How about: I know that humans manufacture pocketwatches.
4512,sarc,You must know a lot of Abortionist to make that claim. And Obviously they must have had you 'round for dinner to know how much they make and where they live. If you have so many Abortionist friends then why are you so anti choice?
4513,sarc,"Oh. Dammit, at least make it a little more obvious. By the way some of these people think on this forum it sounded pretty realistic to me."
4514,sarc,"I believe suicide is murder, no matter how you look at it. It's already illegal, and if you do it, then chances are you're either taking PCP or are mentally unstable."
4515,sarc,"Thankyou for bringing to my attention that atoms, neutrons and protons are merely scientific assumptions. Now as I gaze at the night sky with all its' bits and pieces spinning around each other I can sleep happily knowing that our solar system is not part of a housebrick afterall."
4516,sarc,You telling me that one day I could have claws come out of my hands?........SWEET!
4517,sarc,"Hey, someone has to clean our toilets. This may sound brutal, but one of the biggest reasons why Indians, Asians, etc all are heavy on education is because their lives sucked. They didn't get a education and they were living in poverty. Thus, they seem education, mainly the sciences and the maths as a way to escape poverty. Japanese and Chinese parents are massively strict on their kids because they want their kids of excel as the parents either were poor or grew up poor and know what that's like. This may be necessary for these religious homeschooled folks to find out. Spending a life time in poverty or working 3 jobs to make ends meet will change someone's view point on education."
4518,sarc,"Said like a lazy, ignorant person who would rather live off the sweat of others than go out and earn for himself."
4519,sarc,What can ya expect when they killed free speech in favor of hate speech tribunals? Diversity at work maybe?
4520,sarc,"Really, can you show me this science? You are just as genetically similiar to a white person as you are to an embryo."
4521,sarc,At least you are aware of your own mental deficiencies.
4522,sarc,"But didn't you know? The USA is a CHRISTIAN NATION and all other beliefs are subservient to that. They don't get it, they actally believe that they're doing good and are also doing it for our own good as well.   It isn't terrorists, or any other outside force which are a threat to American rights and freedoms, it is those like the Christian right who you truly have to fear. Those like Pat Robertson, or Jerry Falwel who have influence and many others as well like your President. How many other Judges feel and believe the same as Judge Moore in Alabama did?"
4523,sarc,"Don't even think about contriving how gay marrige violates YOUR RIGHTS assmonkey. That's the most ludicrous, inane statement I have yet heard from the Religious Right."
4524,sarc,"And of course, the theory of gravity isn't ""physically"" proven either. Neither is the heliocentric theory or atomic theory or the germ theory of disease. However, evolution has been observed to occur and the current theories are the best explanations that we have for the observations. As far as your mangling of the ""Out of Africa"" theory, it would be nice if you actually learned what you are talking about before you babble such nonsense."
4525,sarc,###!! You're seriously advocating allowing kids to take guns to school? Don't you have enough greiving parents already without giving kids the option to shoot out a disagreement?
4526,sarc,"Really? Well, when I have a kid, I'll be sure to just leave it in the woods, since it can apparently care for itself."
4527,sarc,That's it? That was your post? To attack a source without anything backing you up? Bravo!
4528,sarc,When is science going to get started on the book of Exodus? Job? Proverbs?
4529,sarc,"Are we talking about the same Obama here? The same one, who's head of the DHS, told law enforcement to be on the lookout for anyone who disagreed with the government?"
4530,sarc,well if I don't get an answer here I'll just spread it around the whole internet. Fine with me.
4531,sarc,"Including the mentally ill, those with previous violent felonies, and children?"
4532,sarc,"A woman's right to choose to keep her legs together is not in any way abridged by this bill. Ho, ho,f***ing ho."
4533,sarc,Let's establish a campaign to search for the hypocrisy of people who call themselves pro-life yet find nothing wrong with killing a grown human being.
4534,sarc,"Oh, so this only happens here, huh? Every single hardcore drug addict is here, huh?"
4535,sarc,I see. So the Bible is true because you claim it is true.
4536,sarc,"How would I fill in some of the gaps? Here was my sequence: something like unicellular life to multi-cellular life, random multi-cellular conglomerations to an amoeba, to a fish, to a dinosaur, to a mammal, to an ape, and finally to a man??"
4537,sarc,"Did I claim you did start the thread? Vitroilic hatred, nope pity is the word you are needing there. No I merely pointed out your style of debate. Which I noticed you made no attempt to say it was wrong. Hence guilty as charged simone.   Yep that would be the left's method for free speech. Speech you don't want to hear is banned. On the flip side any conservative speech needs a liberal counterpoint. Am I right simone baby?"
4538,sarc,"And here it is, corrected to remove that little hint of sensationalism that you feel is needed to drum up support for your cause."
4539,sarc,So you think that ID is actually Christanity?   [quote]But in usual fashion you will claim it is me who doesn't understand when it is you who must corrupt the truth with the lies and distortions you tell.
4540,sarc,"Only those ignorant of science and evolution think that ""evolution"" has anything to do with the Bible. I guess that's because creationism is an attempt to pretend that mythology is somehow scientific and makes silly statements about science. It seems that science is somehow anti-Bible in that case when science debunks ignorance."
4541,sarc,You just don't get it. Americans are freemen. Your faith in governments over people is humorous... How does it fell to lick the bootheels of your government overlords..... Rights are inalienable to man. One man has NO right to intefere with another man. I should be able to do as I please as long as I do not intefere with others... How does your government feel about that?
4542,sarc,"Funny, I thought Heribert Nilsson was a botanist. Don't let little details like that get in your way though."
4543,sarc,"So if it's not human, we can kill it? But I dare say that's a different topic completely. Sorry, that was more along animal rights than abortion. Abortion is this for me: If the baby is going to endanger the mother's life as well as the baby, why endanger the baby and the mother? Sticking on the decided path, would you rather kill something you know is human, or something that you're not sure is human. It sounds a bit cruel and I didn't intend it to be that way at all. It's just that one loss would hard enough, why make it two?"
4544,sarc,"Why not? My mother has been 39,for the last 39 years."
4545,sarc,Yeah yeah whatever and there are gay catholics also. The point is that the vast majority of baptists are the <term that has been banned>
4546,sarc,Of course it's solely a product of women's behavior simone. It's the women that has to make the phone call to the stork. The stork doesn't answer calls from men.
4547,sarc,"Here come the Christians, thinking they can know everything by guessing, and commiting the genetic fallacy left and right."
4548,sarc,"Oh really? Gun ownership allowed these ""lunatics"" as you call them, to become government dictators? If I owned 50 guns and 10,000 rounds of ammunition, you're saying I could run the government with an iron fist all by myself, just like that? Any random person can just appoint themselves God over the entire nation, without a single ounce of resistance just because they're armed?"
4549,sarc,"I thought that the most commonly accepted date for the alleged birth of Jesus was in 4 B.C. Assuming the current calendar really were keyed on the birth of Christ, how could Christ have been born Before Christ?"
4550,sarc,"Unfortunately for you, that is not shown, the evidence points in one direction, and one direction only. That of evolution and to the fact that the flood never happened."
4551,sarc,And I'm guessing by your misinformed posts that you have not been high before. Did you recently watch a film called Reefer Madness by any chance?
4552,sarc,"I'm sure it is many a doctors' spiritual duty to relieve suffering, just as Jesus healed the sick.   Besides, who wants to go back to 40 year average lifespan, like they have in Afghanistan? Not me."
4553,sarc,So then the handgun ban did absolutely nothing. Nice to see you could finally admit the truth.
4554,sarc,"If you can't prove or deal in absolutes, then the basis of your argument, the ""absolute"" nature of logic, just became pretty shaky."
4555,sarc,So did you read his mind to determine exactly why he bolded that particular set of words? You are the first mind reader I have encountered here. And considering your disdain and rejection of science from cosmology to biology what does it matter if something is terrible science. According to you all science should be terrible. Why do you attempt to use a tool which you reject as being useful?
4556,sarc,Good observation! He is very good at presenting fellatious viewpoints and lack of knowledge and content. He is one of the more fellatious people I know and you won't find him taking notice of the Constitution as the Supreme Law of the Land either.
4557,sarc,"When the pro-life movement began in the early 70's, being pro-life meant you were 100% opposed to any and all abortion. In the early 80's, that standard was watered down to include those who had rape, incest, and the life of the mother exceptions. Now in the 90's, things have declined so rapidly that someone who is only opposed to partial-birth abortions can sell themselves as pro-life.""- Pastor Matt Trewhella   How does that crow taste?"
4558,sarc,"which is pretty much the same thing. The majority of representatives get their way. The representatives are elected by a majority. Being overally picky about it gets you no where...we pretty much have a majority rules nation.   And we still haven't settled the question about how you think you can impose your belief on others but I can't. The ""convention"" idea didn't work, the idea that you aren't imposing a belief on others didn't work, so what is next?"
4559,sarc,Here's a novel idea - how about the right gives up the abstinence programmes (scientifically unproven) and improves access to and information on b/c to stop women having UPPs in the first place? Just a thought.
4560,sarc,"Then you would have to be believe that out of the supposed millions upon millions of people who walked the Earth none of them were pregnant and there were no newborns either. Then again, to be Christian, you also have to believe the world was created in 7 days and their was a Biblical great flood too. The best part about writing a fairytale is that the author gets to make up everything as they go along."
4561,sarc,See above I guess.And if you read the article (if)what about the other half?
4562,sarc,I see you know nothing about the subject...hardly a surprise.
4563,sarc,"Yeah, because the Brady ratings and approval of a particular states gun laws has no bearing on reality as far as crime and safety goes! Which is Nato's real point!"
4564,sarc,"You apparently know as much about law as you do about science. You wouldn't be arrested for having someone willingly consume a plant unless that plant was a controlled substance and last time I checked, poppy and weed weren't cancer cures."
4565,sarc,I don't think that Paul was actively gay. He was so odd about having anykind of sex at all that it was pretty warped.
4566,sarc,Really? Let's see you show that the God that you believe in is that God.. and that this God even exists outside the imaginations of the mind?
4567,sarc,"and where did they find the participants for this study, bath houses and bars? Gay men are a hidden population in statistical relms. It is very hard to get a true random sample of data on gay men. Studies will say whatever the funder of the study wants it to say. You just get data from the right place. If you want gay men to look like raging alcoholics get your study participants in a bar. If you want them to look like sexaholics then you get your study subjects in bathouses. The truth is that to have honest statistical data you need RANDOM SAMPLES."
4568,sarc,"I've decided that I will answer this question once and for all if someone can prove to me why people need tennis racquets. If someone can answer this for me, I will attempt the definitive assault weapon response. Have at it."
4569,sarc,Aww... The poor widdle babies. The evil gun just jumped into their hands and turned them into mindless killing machines.
4570,sarc,"And if the state decides to keep abortion legal? Then you don't care if these ""gifts from God"" have a chance or not?"
4571,sarc,"lol...you read my whole post only to conclude with ""what's your point."" Evolutionist brilliance on display. I'm not mistaking nothing for nothing. I know my stuff. You obviously know nothing and don't care to learn it."
4572,sarc,"Oh, right. And what would yours be? ""We the humble people of the human species have decided to break away from Britan rule and form our own bubble community. No one has any rights whatsoever, and we restrict our citizens to living in bubbles because we cherish each life, from skin cells to bacteria to plants to embryos. In fact, we really have no purpose in life, we just life to not kill other lives."
4573,sarc,"Oh god I guess you know where this is headed?This is the first I've heard of this,sounds like know one died though(hope this didn't hex it)."
4574,sarc,"typical strategy of the gay movement when challenged, resort to name calling ""trolls"" bigot etc, - project this form of abusive behavior on the adopted child who rebels against his gay 'carers' once he understands the reality of a heterosexual world.   Placing children with gay couples is unnecessary and harmful - if group homes are the only alternative then it is argued such environments are more healthy and indeed normal than farming kids out to gays"
4575,sarc,Hmmm.... your religious predecessors would have sentenced you to house arrest for something so heretical.
4576,sarc,You show me the post where I said I thought terrorists killing children was a good idea and I will eat my keyboard.
4577,sarc,"Really? Then why did you start off your little rant by admitting that ""...microevolution cannot be reasonably disputed."" Evolution has been observed, and that is a fact. Speciation in both plants and animals has been observed, and that is a fact. Apparently you don't know what a theory is. Might it not be wise to learn just a little about science before you make yourself look so foolish? Theories explain facts."
4578,sarc,So taking peoples rights away is an american value? I think I will push for legislation to make cancer surgery illegal. After all cancer cells are human life too and with modern medical tech they could become a human being also.
4579,sarc,"No, you wouldn't have. I'd have a better chance of winning the lottery without buying a ticket."
4580,sarc,"Well, we have our head in the sand in more ways than one."
4581,sarc,"I once walked into Halbergs office in an effort to borrow a big XY plotter his group had available. Before I left he overwhelmed me with an extended lecture on chronobiology and his current work as well as a large sheath of reprints and reviews. A very vocal advocate of his field (and it WAS his field) and quite a character. Of course I met him in the morning and perhaps he was on a chronobiological peak at the time who can say. Anyway I did get access to the plotter for some chemical work I was doing, and I learned a bit about his work and interests. Productive meeting."
4582,sarc,It wasn't meant as an insult...just a statement of fact. I likely have as many or more inadequacies than do you.
4583,sarc,"Actually when you read every thing you have to rationalize (lie) what God actually did, for God was done with everything then started again. THe stories don't parallel each other they intersect."
4584,sarc,Our pumping of CO2 is certaintly not helping. Does that mean we should pump gasses and make people in big cities sneeze?
4585,sarc,"* - edit: you know, actually, evidence in the form of experimental results are reviewed, or at least the methods are reviewed, and then if the experiment isn't reproducible then the evidence becomes suspect, so in that light evidence is, sort of, reviewed. Eh, who cares?)"
4586,sarc,"So theistic evolution is not a belief, not a faith at all? It is simply a humanistic idea that is based on science, using God to fill gaps?"
4587,sarc,"Hey Dane, you're real good at calling people ignorant, sanctimoniously declaring everything they say as false, blatantly false, or falsehoods. But would it be too much to ask for you to back up your rejection of berts arguments with anything more than insults? Like some actual facts for example?"
4588,sarc,"Okay I don't care what you call it, but let's take it back to the human being part. If your brain was transplanted into Steve's body, would the new person have your memory and your life experiences and your reasoning powers? For instance, you believe a human being begins at conception. If Steve believed a human being began at birth, would this new individual believe that a human began at conception or at birth?"
4589,sarc,"yeah, the lithologically all encompassing, all bedform forming, process immune FLUD"
4590,sarc,"Well, that's because all those things happened during the Age of Law (the god of swift and harsh justice bit), whereas now we're in the Age of Grace (the god is all-forgiving bit), so . . . . er . . . hang on a minute."
4591,sarc,You mean like how you suck any rationale thought or discourse from a debate topic? Talk about ABORTING.
4592,sarc,"Has the American Medical Association decided to recognize that aluminum, steel and polymer and addictive narcotic substances that can drastically alter a person's mental status?"
4593,sarc,And you're accusing him of not debating properly? That's the best you can do?
4594,sarc,So the fact that terrorists board airplanes should be used against people in determining whether they can be trusted or not? My government must not trust an ordinary dirtbag like me because it makes me go through a security check before boarding a plane.
4595,sarc,"Yes, prove it by science. I don't want you to keep reverting to word games/sophistry; philosophical arguments. You must prove it by science. Show me the scientific experiment that proves it. I've asked you a number of times, and every time you've failed to do so."
4596,sarc,"Oh that greatly changes the equation doesn't it? Very unrealistic, but for the sakes of the debate, why not? Well, alledgedly, 23 innocent people have been put to death, and for sure two unrefutable cases. I don't support killing people as a deterrent or as any means in a justice system."
4597,sarc,"Not really. It just means that Homo erectus was around in Africa 200,000 and 125,000 years ago. So some of them stayed around in Africa. What's your point?"
4598,sarc,And oddly enough you have been given several on silver platters. Perhaps you need to visit a neurologist and get checked for memory problems? Just to remind you once more - SICKLE CELL TRAIT is a mutation AND it benefits the phenotype under specific definable conditions. Do you really want to get hit about the head with that bat yet again?
4599,sarc,Great idea. Explain why all the tests that prove it wrong are irrelevant.
4600,sarc,There you go. It's difficult to find which side of your mouth to talk out of when the facts are the facts!
4601,sarc,And I suspect WW understands it about as well as you do...
4602,sarc,"I was under the impression that he was referencing the video...since he always interchanges the words embryo and fetus I just rolled with it.   Secondly, an embryo does have instructions for a brain...while a plant does not. I guess the answer hear depends on the ever evolving definition of ""mental existence""."
4603,sarc,"I think if that happened, Texas probably will go back to being the lone star state."
4604,sarc,"Now name one country with universal socialized healthcare with a population of 300 million citizens modulus, just one if you can. Your exemplar countries are tiny in comparison to us so lets get realistic and compare apples to apples for once, ok?"
4605,sarc,So you agree that it's not necessary to have high capacity magazines because gun owners can reload quickly when defending themselves against a criminals. Good we can agree on at least one thing.
4606,sarc,And Creationists who can't tell the difference between cats and nuclear reactors don't understand fluid mechanics.
4607,sarc,"No, Archangel, if it wasn't done with a gun present any murders committed do not count. In this case, one armed person could have ended the slaughter so quickly it would be incredible but the blood dancers still could have had their day by celebrating that the gun put the children at risk more than the knife murderer and no telling what else they could say to dramatize the situation by claiming that guns were banned there and THAT person broke the law so off with his head...after they harvested his body for useful organs that is."
4608,sarc,"Actually, no one cares if you believe in god. That is your business since it is something that you take on faith without any evidence that it is true. And no one believes in ""evolutin"" [sic]. The theory of evolution is an explanation for observed facts that has been repeatedly tested. It is the best explanation that scientists have been able to formulate. It is based on evidence and not faith."
4609,sarc,"Oh yeah, like that hasn't been tried before /sarcasm It darn sure isn't about crime control. No doubt some nefarious excuse to farther control the people and attempt to charge user fees to discourage a right. No doubt sinjin will approve so ""they"" can match fingerprints and type of ammo to the DROS registration file?"
4610,sarc,"And to think we almost had cure for cancer, just vanquish the damonic spirits."
4611,sarc,"Not true. I googled ""helpful mutation"" and got a nice list of examples. I wish creationists would do some research before making wild assertions."
4612,sarc,Reasonable gun regulation is an oxymoron like military intelligence. You mean like Bill Ayers (sic) and his wife or Carl Rowen? Wait my bad they aren't from the right.
4613,sarc,"And here is the crux of the matter where I think Libertarians are missing it: As one Founding Father said, ""There can be no liberty without virtue."" Someone else once said, ""Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their bindings"".   If the God of the Bible is right, a nation which legalizes sin and intemperance loses the favor of God. And when the sins of a nation reach their fullness (in God's eyes), that disfavor can turn to judgment (Genesis 15:16, Deuteronomy Chapter 28 - ""The blessings of obedience and curses of disobedience). Therefore, while many of the Libertarians mean well on liberal social issues, they nevertheless either don't see the big picture, or they don't believe it will occur."
4614,sarc,"Actually, if you read the friggin article (*GASP* HERESY!!!), you'd see that this guy was attacked while WALKING FROM THE STORE. If you can't see the difference between his mental existence (quite enough to allow him to move about and do relatively ordinary chores like going to the store), and a foetus that does not have mental existence, there is no hope for you."
4615,sarc,"NO, gun registration should not be mandatory anywhere in the US. The government has no business knowing who has a gun. Gun registration could possibly allow the government to infringe on constitutional guarantees provided by the Bill Of Rights. Just knowing that there are many Senators and Congressmen who would like to abolish gun rights gives credence to the fact that government could actually try to limit or ban the 2nd Amendment in the future.   P.S. Crazy is as Crazy says. Scary to think that some would believe that a registered gun that becomes a stolen gun would help in finding the thief or killer if that same criminal gets rid of the gun. Which, if later found, would then be traced back to the legitimate owner, who may not even know the gun had been stolen. The alibi better be outstanding!"
4616,sarc,Could you avoid your constant use of strawman`s fallacies please?
4617,sarc,I dunno. Those Priuses are so small inside and out. How much explosive compound could Hasan fit into the thing and still be able to get in and drive it?
4618,sarc,"So, some parts of the Bible are erroneous oral history after all! What a refreshing admission."
4619,sarc,"So it doesn't matter that someone dies in their forties from hunger and cold because they are homeless and penniless, whilst another lives in luxury with the best food and medicines until his 80s: they are both equal? What planet do you live on, for it sure aren't the real world..."
4620,sarc,"All sin undermines society, including illicit gay sex sin. Or have you forgotten Sodom and Gomorrah? Coming to a San Francisco bath house near you."
4621,sarc,"You mean to tell me you would deny a life to be lived out and someone to get away with a harmful crime?? wow, sounds like a liberal to me.."
4622,sarc,"I dunno. What is the scoop here? You complain about the responses we give, and yet you keep coming back for more. Even people with down syndrome learn enough to only stick their hands in the open flame once."
4623,sarc,"Oh it applies, but if we were to look at the Bible that way, God wouldn't allow one single bad thing to happen."
4624,sarc,"Is he anti gay? Yes so they are all in the same boat and cut from the same hatefilled, homophobic, bigoted, christianist cloth."
4625,sarc,You mean like Eclipses. Oh wait. That was a miracle explained by Science!
4626,sarc,"And, I'm sure that Terri Schiavo was fully aware of all that Bush and radical rightwing religionists did for her and appreciates what they did."
4627,sarc,Apes are sentient...guess your theory is out the window. Either that or Apes need to be freed from the zoo.
4628,sarc,"That's right! Let them burn and murder the people who work in abortion clinics. It's all for a good cause, so why not? After all it has been done before and it worked as the murdered doctor never carried out anymore abortions."
4629,sarc,Talk about a crock! How can you wail on anyone with your imaginary truth stick of no mercy when you wouldn't know the truth if you tripped over it? And you going ballistic like this just proves the exact point I made in that you'll allow my free speech until I say something you disagree with and then you attack me to shut me up. Which is exactly what I said above that precipitated your childish tirade. See?
4630,sarc,point me toward the right way then? if creationists are wrong then why is evolution right? this is a biased answer based on your beliefs. please tell us how creationists were wrong. i would gladly like to see you try!
4631,sarc,So you yourself could have gone gay but chose to be attracted to women?
4632,sarc,So in other words your God put you on Earth to stop people from killing so your God could kill them eventually?
4633,sarc,And why would you say something like this? Because Christianity prohibits it? I can't think of any other reason.
4634,sarc,"Spain, unlike most modern democracies, very very recently had the uh.. privilege of living under a strong, ""moral"" government that supported the uh.. ""family values"" so important to the right.   That they are running like hell away from it should tell people something."
4635,sarc,"You mean that hole that has been observed and proven, repeatedly? Climate Change is a controversy in the same way as the earth being broadly spherical is a controversy. There's a group of nutters who think the earth is flat; doesn't mean there is any reason to believe it is."
4636,sarc,"Oh I understand plenty. What you want is a system where a person is held responsible for crimes that they didn't commit. You want ""guilty by association"" extended to the point of ridiculousness where anybody who even met the criminal even once can be held as an accomplice."
4637,sarc,"Let's clean up our terminology. ""Color"" is just our brains' way of comprehending wavelength of light, so instead of saying ""color,"" let's say ""wavelength."" You took Kronus's statement as meaning that we can make machines that can see wavelengths that we can't see with our eyes. This is true."
4638,sarc,"So in your own words the police want to go on murder sprees, because they're armed. According to you the military is just waiting for the first convenient excuse to open fire on anyone, be them designated enemies or just innocent bystanders."
4639,sarc,"But you are ok with a woman deciding what is right for someone else's own body...specifically the babies?   Seems to me a woman isn't more qualified to deal with the issue of abortion than a man. In fact, it could be said that the man has the only independent perspective."
4640,sarc,"But you are the accuser. I've read the Bible and I have studied religion, more than you can imagine. I have also studied biology, performed experiments and reached conclusions. The problem is that you seem unable to think for yourself."
4641,sarc,So you support allowing a 10 y/o to buy an Uzi and carry it into a federal court house or school as long as he does not commit a crime? Wow.   And your logic about taking criminals off the street and then having no gun control concerns would be perfect...if we had a finite number of criminals. We don't. New murderers and theives and carjackers and dope dealers and bank robbers and child rapists are born every day.
4642,sarc,"Math is confusing too, doesn't mean we should get rid of it."
4643,sarc,And what is so special about religion that give people special rights for a choice? I say no special rights for religion.
4644,sarc,Does it function better on tobacco? Alcohol? Caffine? How about hundereds and hundereds of different pills?
4645,sarc,"And God lives in Heaven, with Jesus sitting on the right side of Him."
4646,sarc,"But if this was a republican program, you'd have no problem with it. You are a rightwing hypocrite, Archie Baby."
4647,sarc,"HOLY COW!!!! Is this the ""Sacred Institution of Marriage"" you and jyoshu are so fervent to protect?"
4648,sarc,"You see, that's the problem: ""generally"". You obviously know little or nothing of how prejudice works in this country."
4649,sarc,"If we did not have criminals, we wouldnt have ""shoot outs"" as you so call them."
4650,sarc,"If science deals with how information is gathered, different ways of analyzing, and different hypothesis, then it involves worldviews. The base for the worldview of a sizable part of the population should not be excluded. Maybe in Saddam Hussien's Iraq, maybe in communist Russia, but not in the United States."
4651,sarc,"And if one accepts that gay citizens have equal rights under that Constitution, then one has to accept that a ban on gay marriage is intrinsically unconstitutional."
4652,sarc,"Last time I checked most state boards merely set the guidelines, whether or not they are followed is something entirely different. Still the fact that you have a board of education spouting such ridiculousness is pretty damn amusing."
4653,sarc,I think he is just disturbed because he didn't get his 40 acres and mule?
4654,sarc,"So if you quoted Ted Kennedy when he said to his wife in an event that wasn't even publicized ""Good morning, sweetie"", that would be an answer?"
4655,sarc,"No, back to school... turn in what educational credntials you feel you have, and just stay at the coffeehouses... at least you have a .005% of hearing someone ineject some truth in one of those sidewalk tete a' tete's you nutters are so fond of... but here you are dead wrong. Have you ever heard of an egg? ever heard of a sperm? An egg is still considered a multiple cell organism, and a sperm as well. You're gonna have a hard time pulling that one off."
4656,sarc,"In that case a man in a coma is not a person then, is he?"
4657,sarc,"Then by that standard, christianity is horse puckey! Christians contradict each other. Oh! But wait. Anyone who disagrees with you isn't ""really"" a christian."
4658,sarc,"Most congregations are expecting to leave the U.C.C.? Where did you see this, or are you making up the news again?"
4659,sarc,"Now you've ruined it! You're not supposed to mention god. That's the whole idea. ID is stealth creationism. XXXXXX pretend that there is some scientific basis for the assertion that there is some sort of magical designer that is responsible for everything, but they don't say it's god. If they did that, then ID would be religion and introducing it into schools would be unconstitutional."
4660,sarc,I am not the origin of anything....I originated in my parents....from where did they originate?
4661,sarc,Looks like dancing in the blood of innocents to me.
4662,sarc,"Well, you got that one exactly right. I didn't bother to watch your video. It was pretty predictable coming from you - personal attacks on creationists. I quoted YOU because of what YOU said."
4663,sarc,"You forgot about the youth recruitment efforts as well. I am president of the local chapter of ""Get 'Em While They're Young."" Our mission (agenda, if you will) is to recruit and convert the kids in an effort to increase the prevalence of homosexuality to 20% by 2015, then 51% by mid-century when we will have total control, muahahahahaha!!!"
4664,sarc,Jesus! Another scientific illiterate. The facts are the observations. And the point is not to test facts but to explain them with an hypothesis that suggests a prediction as a consequence that can be tested by experimentation.
4665,sarc,"Or, given that this is about feasts, a waist is a terrible thing to mind."
4666,sarc,No more circular than your. Except that your assertions aren't backed up by any evidence.
4667,sarc,"I don't know? How about a person from a group known to do almost anything to get money, but also realises the pain they would bring to a child if they had one."
4668,sarc,"Confucius, that is one of the biggest puddles of sentimental puppy dribble that has ever been manufactured."
4669,sarc,"HELLO!! THAT'S WHY!! Then we see the standard dance of how innocent and objective science really is.   6) And the standard ""theistic evolution"" dance. Atheistic evolutionists can't get along without it! I wonder if Kenneth Miller will see the movie, and comment on it. I wonder if he'd have refused to be a part of it."
4670,sarc,So cross jurisdictional escort is a fairly common occurrence in the area. You will note that it is not the local cops talking about not being informed....it is the author of the article whining about it.
4671,sarc,"So, you have no problem with the fact that this is abortion and was caused by god?"
4672,sarc,"Hmmm, a mere human-mother cannot make decisions concerning her own body, but you, sk8joyful, can usurp the position of God and tell another human, especially a mere human-mother, what she is allowed to do with her body."
4673,sarc,"gooey cute as this reads, how is this relevant to the philosophy discourse?"
4674,sarc,"And the resemblance of the bill of a platypus to that of a duck is superficial. You don't actually try to learn the basic facts about anything before you speak out, do you?"
4675,sarc,And you say juleacatz is the one who views pregnancy as a punishment for women.
4676,sarc,"No, I for one dislike your posts because I know you intentionally write irrational posts to help support your religious cause.   Just for the record montalban, basically every single legitimate scientist is ""pro-evolution"". Creation theory is not taught in public schools, not by chance, but because...*gasp* it's RELIGIOUS MUMBO JUMBO. There is no evidence to support it. Creation fiction has made no progress with it's ""faith-based"" (lackofevidence) with rational people.   And I'll also say that I'd welcome ad hominem over irrational thinking any day. Ad hominem is just a lack of patience, or someone who doesn't care to hide their emotion or opinion. Irrational thinking on the other hand is often only cured by death. Someone guilty of ad hominem can still hold a rational debate. The irrational..well, why bother?   -Mach"
4677,sarc,"So what does this have to do with the topic? Alcohol is legal, marijuana isn't, but they both serve the same purpose (getting high), so why should one be illegal and the other not?"
4678,sarc,"Actually, it is quite apparent that you do not. For one glaring example, below you incorrectly state that a dinosaur fossil has been dated by C-14. Another example of you lack of understanding of the topic is your failure to understand why very old fossils are found on the surface and the principles of dating from geologic strata."
4679,sarc,"What, pray, is a real answer? Because, you know, if it is anything like a corrcect answer you are doing a rather poor job of it, mate."
4680,sarc,Well so is falling out of a building onto a piece of rebar. Or getting mashed in a car crash. There are a lot more of those than shootings but you don't seem to care. Why is that? Is it because you love to dance in blood?
4681,sarc,"Did the bill include burning heretics at the stake, stoning them out of the village or removing a women's right to vote?"
4682,sarc,So your biased reading of the Bible coupled with your personal flaws and your misunderstanding of science is the basis of your religiosity? Somehow I don't think that's something you'd really want to brag about...
4683,sarc,I see you still don't understand what a strawman is. It is hard to have a strawman when the comment wasn't directed at any particular claim....
4684,sarc,How often to you poke your nose into monkey genitals in order to know that?
4685,sarc,"No is the only answer one can make to that claim - its false. Indeed there is no claim made within NDS to ""creativity"" at all. NDS does not to deal with creativity which is a mental process. NDS deals with plain old biology. Evolution does not require creativity although NS does provide a non-random element to the process."
4686,sarc,"Oh, if we only had the requisite absolute civilian gun bans, sick things like this would never happen! Huh Brady?"
4687,sarc,Is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? Is Sarah Palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?
4688,sarc,"Is there a defined number of posts he could make in the other threads so that you would consider them ""finished""?"
4689,sarc,"In my case, it isn't 'god fearing'.. so much as ""believer fearing'"
4690,sarc,Didn't a famous gangster once escape from jail using a gun he carved from soap? Maybe OZ should ban bars of soap?
4691,sarc,Most certainly. The fact that you think that it is unnecessary only underlines your ignorance. Why don't you discuss beetle lungs for us. Those are organs necessary for the survival of both bears and cheetahs. How about livers. Same story. Thyroid? Pituitary? Pancreas? Go for it.
4692,sarc,I have no problem with them preaching against gays in their churches and the privacy of thier homes. Its when they crawl out from under their rocks that I have a problem. I also have absolutly no problem what so ever with them talking about Jesus if only they would keep to the subject of Jesus and leave all gay issues alone. Unfortually Paul has replaced Jesus in many churches.
4693,sarc,"Well, if my plane is already doomed as you say then what difference would it make? Don't you think this poll is leading? It's designed to give the answer that you want."
4694,sarc,Better get back on the meds. It appears that your lithium level has dropped a tad and increased your paranoia.   Here's a little info on the Pope:
4695,sarc,So biology didn't exist before the theory of evolution was formulated?
4696,sarc,Isn't the point pretty obvious- that exposure to a gun can raise testosterone levels and trigger violent and aggressive thoughts and actions?
4697,sarc,"Repeating superstitious nonsense makes it no less mythological than the first, second and third time you were shown it to be so. Skeletons, even from the BRONZE age, let alone your incorrect reference to the stone age, are not fossils."
4698,sarc,"Why you quoted me is questionable. What I posted was merely a series of mathematical equations proving that Hovind is completely full of ****. How you consider mathematical equations ""mockery"" I don't know, but more likely, you did not bother to watch the video. Instead, in your normal fashion, you simply ASSUMED what you wanted to believe and then went from there rather then actually looking at what it was and what it had to say.   Your post more accurately is towards the link that AA posted in defense of his beliefs (yet failed to realize was satirizing those beliefs). Furthermore, I'm not an atheist even though your poor definition wants me to be."
4699,sarc,"Oh, I get it. So you believe, but you don't exactly ""believe""."
4700,sarc,"How bout $500,000 for a slaughterhouse that kills thousands of innocent animals just sitting in a line? What's your point? That we shouldn't eat meat?"
4701,sarc,So everything that other people say on a website or in a book is just and opinion? And everything you say is a fact? Nice how you've got things set up.
4702,sarc,"So Simone, if the shooter had instead driven his Toyota Prius into a crowd, killing many as a result, would you call for banning Toyota Priuses?"
4703,sarc,"And what does he mean by that? You apparently don't have a clue. Tell me, do you have any idea what ""secondary cause"" is?"
4704,sarc,"And of course, the sea of Montalban's assertions as science, the sea of Montalban's out of context quotes, or the sea of Montalban's misrepresentations of what others have said. It seems that Montalban knows the ""TROOTH"" and won't be discouraged with facts. Sadly, Montalban knows what he believes and reality seems to be irrelevant."
4705,sarc,"And you have just described ""creation science."" No application of the scientific method. No testing. The conclusions are known before the judicious quoting of scientific authority has even begun. I notice that you use one of those quotes of a scientific authority below. You show that you are what you decry."
4706,sarc,What does spelling have to do with your own opinion? Again this isn't just about you although I think you did resort to correcting someone's spelling and just didn't answer the question. This has nothing to do with being entitled to your own opinion. It is equally bad for anyone to resort to personal attacks on either side of the debate.
4707,sarc,So taking away all their guns would have been better? The ruling party was certainly well armed how about the other parties?
4708,sarc,"How do they use ""the empirical evidence prove it"", when they do no research, and no evidence actually supports their ""theory""?"
4709,sarc,I think jyoshu has posted a BS meter which is pretty nice.
4710,sarc,"All of your evidence came from a christian website. Could you have showed us anything more baised. Couldn't you fine something from National Geographic or anything non-biased. Of course all this stuff points to the bible. That is exaclt what these scientists are trying to do. Buy as usual creationist use info that discounts evolution rather than proving creationism. All of these articles spend more time talking about how evolution is not the way the world was started, and spend little time talking about how creationism was the way."
4711,sarc,Within one post.   Thanks for proving that creationist are incapable of discussing the original topic and automatically move to change the subject.
4712,sarc,"And I challange you to find just one instance where he's ever claimed that ALL fossils have ALWAYS been found at precisely the right depth. And then link to it, of course. It will be amusing to see how you misinterpreted whatever was actually said."
4713,sarc,"Translation; ""Do what I say or I will kick your @ss."" Sounds a lot like the mafia. And you love this diety?"
4714,sarc,"So, is a giant Panda a bear? Or some other ""kind""?"
4715,sarc,Because those who are pro life are against a womens right to own her own body. Her body her choice and none of anyone elses business. Remember control freaks are everywhere.
4716,sarc,"All the more reason to be armed to the teeth huh,does this mean you see it our way?"
4717,sarc,"So if it can be operated by means other than human control, are you saying a dog can operate it, maybe a monkey, thats something we see everyday. You are trying to split hairs Penfold, for a gun to be fired weather robotically, or training a primate to fire one still requires human intervention, so stop acting stupid because you are not stupid."
4718,sarc,60% accepting Roe v Wade is a high figure don't you think? More people support abortion then the president.
4719,sarc,"It's sophomoric remarks like that that hurt the gay cause in America.   God isn't mocked, though. And I doubt the people are either.   And I'm glad California outlawed the sin. The only thing you have left is to hope the far left, spiritually-stunted judges in the US Supreme Court are pro Sodom and Gomorrah."
4720,sarc,And yet the species that exist today are the exact same as the species during the high oxygen content? That makes little sense. It's like saying the world was vastly different before yet perfectly suited for the species that exist today. That is COMPLETELY nonsensical.   Where did all of the oxygen go?
4721,sarc,...or we could feed the criminals to the dinosaurs!...save the cows for meatloaf.
4722,sarc,But you are. You can't just claim someone is not a person and therefore say you are not imposing beliefs on them. If this were the case then I'd just say you aren't a person and therefore when I hurt you it wouldn't be wrong.
4723,sarc,The egg is now a conscious human? In under 72-hours? Wow.
4724,sarc,"Does this seem a little ironic to anyone else? Either becoming intoxicated is acceptable or it isn't, why does the method make one acceptable and practitioners of the other ""losers""? For the record I don't drink, smoke or partake of illegal drugs."
4725,sarc,"Worship me and I'll bless you too. With money of course. He can't even give you money. I am the true god and I created the mindset that he was a god in him. Worship me and spread the word about the true religion. Everyone who joins my church will instantly get $1,000 and after a week of membership you will get $1 million. The end of the week is when my project is and then you can go into the real world. All those who didn't believe in me will be destroyed when my world I created gets to the dump."
4726,sarc,someone needs to go over to IIDB and invite those kooks over here to debate me on this thread. There's currently an open thread over there with my name on it...seems they like obsessing over me....they're like a bunch of teeny boppers obsessing and salivating over a Backstreet Boy.
4727,sarc,So let's just kill them and be done with it. Is that what you're saying?
4728,sarc,"So let me make sure I have it right, in order to be a family-man/Catholic, I must be anti-abortion and against the rights of homosexuals. Is this what makes a good family-man/Catholic; denying the rights of those who are different from what is considered by some to be ""normal"", and telling others what to do with their body?"
4729,sarc,Should all drivers have to help pay for harm done by irresponsible drivers?
4730,sarc,"So, you're basically saying that Biden was lying through his teeth when he said he doesn't support gay marriage? It was all just a lie to keep from losing votes? Interesting."
4731,sarc,Oh no an open minded church that doesn't hate? GASP! And sorry but the bible has many interpretations as is clearly seen in the WIDE and VAST amount of differing denominations. Just because their not closes binded right wing bigots doesn't mean you can grill them cause their interpretation is different...
4732,sarc,What's that? Campaigning and use of taxpayer funded facilities like transportation for political purposes? I suppose they paid the cops for going out of their jurisdiction too?
4733,sarc,If it isn't so hard then why haven't you found it yet? I am still waiting and you becoming cocky is not helping you.
4734,sarc,"Are you like a Chinese government official or something? Oh wait. I forgot, the Chinese government controls what you say anyway, so I guess it matters not."
4735,sarc,Oh they think they can Doc! They think that we gun owners are the terrorist!   Personally. I think that all of this talk about Gun Control is happening because they are mad. They are MAD that a Black Man! Is in the White House!
4736,sarc,"Like the crusades and the inquisition? How about the Southern Baptist Convention, formed at the end of the Civil War with the express purpose to discriminate against blacks? And of course, the KKK and the Aryan Brotherhood make the same claims as you. Of course, you're going to tell me that you are a christian and they aren't. But when people tell me they are christians you aren't always around so I just never turn my back on them. That way, even if they are follow that strange pull to make a bad decision, I will at least have my eye on my money."
4737,sarc,"No, but they will be forced to have babies if they have sex."
4738,sarc,"Wow, so Balrogs existed according to the Bible? Whoda thunk."
4739,sarc,Oh! Goody! At last someone who wants to actually discuss evolution instead of mythology!
4740,sarc,"Oh, i thought ""bullet"" was some sort of slang term. Never mind."
4741,sarc,"You mean you are not going to pretend to you understand it. It means that your argument stating that flaws in the death penalty lay in the judicial system is like me saying that flaws in life imprisonment lay in our prison's security system; not in the punishment itself. It is also like saying that the problem of releasing guilty persons sentenced to life in prison lays with the judicial system, not with the punishment of life in prison. Understand yet?"
4742,sarc,And I just spent all that money on a new camera. Pity.
4743,sarc,Not all threads need to be courttroom style debates. If you choose to aid in establishing a working consensus fine. If you want simply to rave and rant there are plenty of venues where you can do that. Your participation is welcome as long as you are a participant and are seriously trying to resolve the issue. Otherwise for heavens sake go do something else.
4744,sarc,"Again, you speak as if gays and lesbians are not worthy of their relationships being sacred to them. As if gays and lesbians are unable to hold dear any concept of commitment, loyalty, partnership.   What a sad and mean little man you are."
4745,sarc,"You can try and deny the facts all you like. Here they are from the CDC for 2003, go spin them."
4746,sarc,I believe that the theory you speak of is called slavery; everybody is equal because they have nothing and need to work long and hard just to earn the privilege of living in order to serve their masters.
4747,sarc,Pro-lifers are like slave traders? What a pro-lifers trading? Anyone who denies a human being a fundamental human right is a slave trader...like a right to life...???
4748,sarc,"Just helping something live doesn't affect evolution unless it affects the ability to reproduce viable offspring.   If there was no nylon before the 1940s and there is an organism that can survive by eating NOTHING else, what does that tell you? There could not have been a population of nylon-eating bacteria before 1940. This is a new population that did not exist before."
4749,sarc,"And with strict gun control laws too. Wow, who would've believed such a thing were possible."
4750,sarc,Man has changed significantly in the past few thousand years. I see you opted out of history classes and took it upon yourself to make up your own version.
4751,sarc,"yea you've rebuttled every one of my posts with rhetoric. How do you explain how The Computational and Analytical Molecular Evolution Laboratory is calling for a new synthesis based on ""biased"" mutations??????   let's hear it."
4752,sarc,"Which is why the ""medical establishment"" endorses smoking, drinking heavily and a fatty diet, with no excercise, because they believe we are predestined by our genes, right? Why do you persist with these blatant lies?"
4753,sarc,"Well, the pill has the ability to not let it implant, which ""God"" already cause for around 60% of its contemporaries. The pill doesn't destroy the ""entity"" at all."
4754,sarc,"Yeah, I'd say you are wrong. It isn't easy to tell on these forums because we don't have many topics about marriage in vegas."
4755,sarc,Even if winnie the poo could read he simply doesn't have the brain power to comprehend.
4756,sarc,"What about all the ova that weren't fertilized?! Just wasted, completely wasted and forgotten! THE HUMANITY! OH GOD!!!"
4757,sarc,"Oh come on, marc, you can't possibly expect me to swallow that one. Religion, which locked up astronomers? What atheist social policy was geocentrism getting in the way of, hmm? What makes that farce science's fault?"
4758,sarc,How the hell can you narrow it down to three? The competition in the entire top ten is fierce.
4759,sarc,"Oh dear, deluded philisopher nutter alert. No one can empirically prove anything. Fact. End of discussion."
4760,sarc,"Hey, maybe some chosen by God religious fundamentalist will offer up his own daughters to be gang-raped, and then later have sex with those same daughters and children by them. You know, the way Lot did in the Bible. The one Peter called ""a righteous man""."
4761,sarc,And none of those explanations have anything to do with a magic being who made everything out of nothing. Science should teach currently held theory.
4762,sarc,No thanks. There are other ways to meet dates. It's very easy for gays to meet dates that are not officially gay.
4763,sarc,"Regardless of our training in martial arts, the only viable defense against a gun is another gun. If we were all subjected to mandatory martial arts training from birth through adulthood, we'd be not much safer from gun crime than we are right now."
4764,sarc,"No, they don't. Creationists do. ""Why haven't all animals turned into humans?"""
4765,sarc,"YOu mean they don't eat, sleep , pass wastes, fight (not neccesarily physically) for dominance in their social setting, react to the opposite sex, put on displays for the opposite sex, and things like that?   How very odd."
4766,sarc,"So you see a cop on the streets, you see he's armed, that's enough to induce aggression and violence, possibly cause you to hurt others, simply because you saw that somebody else was armed?"
4767,sarc,Anything that doesn't fit your preconcieved prejudices is automaticlly wrong?
4768,sarc,"It has been 33 years. The allies managed to stop the holocaust in only two. You guys are certainly dragging your feet at stopping the great American ""holocaust"" against ""unborn babies."""
4769,sarc,"What are you talking about.... This is the law: A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.   How is this Anarchy? BTW the article is being sarcastic if you didn't get it, It demonstrates the hypocracy of the lunatic fringe lefties out there... Did Rosie bring her armed guards to san fran to get hitched?"
4770,sarc,Would it be the lawless Cardinal Law officiating at one of the funerary masses for JPII and otherwise serving in a prominent role in all the pomp and circumstance surrounding the pope's death?
4771,sarc,"Say hello to my little friend! We the people, through our State Governments!"
4772,sarc,Oh what a shame! Especially if it's true! Where did you get the idea that ID theory is not based on evidence and/or testing?
4773,sarc,That has to be a typo my friend. If you can compress the EB into only 1012 bits then you can write your own ticket in the field of data compression! Lets see 100 million pages into 1012 bits - fantastic - please tell us how. I really would like to put the entire literature of mankind (and more) on an Ipod.
4774,sarc,"Don't like it when the person you're arguing against can be as sarcastic as you are, huh? I understand, I get these types of whines all the time.   thistownwilleat-"
4775,sarc,So the fact that it is not legally recognized is the problem. What is the reason it's not legally recognized? Because the couple is gay.
4776,sarc,"And where exactly is your proof that ""Stop, don't touch, leave the area, tell an adult"" is indoctrination and translates to ""go out and buy a gun, buy as many guns as possible, obsess over the gun, etc."""
4777,sarc,"Good- we were tired of you not responding or saying, ""it isn't worth my time."""
4778,sarc,And it is heat that resets the clock. Thus it is volcanic rock and ash that can be dated most reliably.
4779,sarc,"So? God also says he made you out of dirt and then supernaturally lifting the dirt from the ground into the woman's uterus. Oh well, I suppose it is all beliefs no matter how silly it sounds."
4780,sarc,Do try to keep up with yourself. People like you are always talking about how we need gun control laws in response to the crimes taking place. But you have absolutely no answer for what to do when said laws are violated.
4781,sarc,"But maybe god does not hate gays, maybe he just hates the ones that demand to have sex with people whether they want it or not."
4782,sarc,"Many of the Christian denominations are ignoring them the same way they ignore the prohibitions against pork, mixed cloth, and stoning your children to death because they sass you."
4783,sarc,"Here's some advice, if you're going to try and crack on me, make your 'jokes' (I'll be nice and call them that) less passive and more active, grammar-wise.   Crim-   A definition is the meaning of word that someone created using their own opinions. Is there a difference?   And, a circle could be called a circle in the English language, but I could make up a new language in which a circle would be called a square and a square a circle."
4784,sarc,"No, SS. I've made it quite clear I have no intention of pandering to your ignorance which you hold so dear. pandion has answered all your questions before in rigorous detail, and you've ignored his answers. I feel no need to join that club. If the day ever comes when you don't feel the need to protect your ignorance, if you ever trully wish to expand your horizons and actually learn, then go out and get a genentics book as I recommended. Till then I see no reason for me to engage in a lengthy explanation which you won't even read. I'm sure you'll twist this in your mind to indicate something profound, but then I really can't be held responsible for whatever goes on in that skull of yours, so I can't worry myself about it too much."
4785,sarc,"Just to be pedantic, a better analogy would be: ""If you are here, why do you have brothers and sisters?"""
4786,sarc,"No. What the doctor was doing was going to church. He was not a monster. He was not a ""sicko."" He was a murder victim.   What his murderer did was murder."
4787,sarc,"um... gee... its killing a baby... now.. before 8 weeks, its not in the form of a human being.. at 4 weeks, its a fish.. at 5.. its a rodent.. but after 8.. its in the shape of a human... there is no way around that fact."
4788,sarc,"Oh, but Sina does not live in a womb so she is unimportant."
4789,sarc,"No, but I read some of the evidence and it looked pretty solid. If this person was sentenced to life in prison without parole would you question the verdict?"
4790,sarc,"that's right, i don't want ANOTHER parental figure to tell me what to do, when to do it, and how to do it."
4791,sarc,"If all women aborted every pregnancy, there would be babies? Maby on your planet..."
4792,sarc,"No, think about what you just said. A cancer cell doesn't mutate, it attacks healthy cells and causes the destruction of healthy tissue. Kinda like liberals in a healthy society - they are the free radicals of the body politic, huh... go figure."
4793,sarc,"Considering what the TOE says, if a dolphin ever gave birth to a chipmunk, it would disprove evolution."
4794,sarc,"Wow, what a group of rude, self important, pompous, pseudo intellectuals who will insult and personally attack a person for one grammatical error. I meant to say the UNIVERSE has aged from 4 to 14 billion years old since I was in school but rather than deduce that you call me dumb and ignorant ? With all of your so called intelligence can you prove the Universe is now precisely 14 billion years old ? Can you prove Neanderthal Man was a human descendant ? because DNA tests dont prove that out and yet PHDs and Masters Degreed scientists insist they are. That's why the bible say's that the wisdom of this World is foolishness to God."
4795,sarc,It's as much of a point that Phillp Johnson has. Trying to use Philip Johnson as a source about evolution is like trying to use Jack Chick as a source about Catholism.
4796,sarc,"Oh gosh , a whole bunch of cut/pastes from a 14 year old that is showing off their lack of knowledge. These are not unknown situations, and are very easily explained."
4797,sarc,"Dude, it's, like, all over the Bible, man! Maybe if you hit your forehead with Bibles more often, you would know these things!"
4798,sarc,"Hey sparky, exactly how do you think they were supposed ""to protect"" these thugs? How many debates do you have to lose like the school claims on the student duck hunter before you begin to say you are either wrong or completely illiterate? You gunning for one of the new yellow CS medals?"
4799,sarc,"You really think so? Im flattered, but I think you are wrong."
4800,sarc,"Actually no. You read the article again, and thoroughly this time."
4801,sarc,"You forget, that all those nice rewards? None of them are rights."
4802,sarc,My pursuit of happiness is denied by trees existing. Let's burn them down and destroy the environment. It's much better than me being unhappy.
4803,sarc,And I the opposite... Kind of a wash I guess.
4804,sarc,"So, which is it? You don't want violators of Federal law to have guns, yet you don't want them to get rid of them either. Can't possibly do both, now can you? Which one? Do the law breakers keep them, or not? Make it against the law to keep the guns...now make it against the law to sell them. DUH! I guess we'll just hang out in limbo-land!"
4805,sarc,I know I know. Unless a woman is gestating or dieing she is being selfish.
4806,sarc,"yea, I often forget ToE is a mental concept, not a scientific one. Nothing -- and I mean nothing -- will ever dismantle it in the minds of the faithful. Materialism is so entrenched in your mind that even if an animal generates a new piece of morphology by mere thought, sensation or awareness, and then passes that trait down to progeny, (which has been shown on here) you still think materialism stands. It's an unfalsifiable mindset that you and millions of others have created for yourselves."
4807,sarc,You throw personal insults more than I do. So when will YOU grow up?
4808,sarc,"Obviously, your family loses all its marbles past the age of 40 and you have never known any wise old people."
4809,sarc,"Good. The less moronic ""spirituality"" in each state the better. Let's move out of the dark ages as fast as we can."
4810,sarc,"So, in your scenario, Prototype, are you anti-choice folk going to force us who believe in choice, who believe that a woman owns her very own body, are you going to place us in re-education jails so that we, too, believe that a fertilized egg is a human being?"
4811,sarc,"Possibly, I must admit I never tried to gain access to swords whilst over there."
4812,sarc,Makes about as much sense as saying many of the car hating crowd (people who support such laws as car registration) also own cars. More evidence that your handlers have trained you to see the world in black and white.
4813,sarc,Well if you don't know the facts then why do you keep coming back for more?
4814,sarc,So being easy to know makes it good? methinks that's not quite right.
4815,sarc,And I was correcting you. If you are offended then that's the breaks.
4816,sarc,"Never thought of that. If that ""person"" has rights, do they have responsibilities? Could a fetus be charged for causing toxemia? How about suing the little tyke for giving mom varicose veins and stretch marks?"
4817,sarc,Voice of Reason? HmmHe used to be in Military Intelligence hence the debacle in Vietnam. He probably still thinks that the US won the war.
4818,sarc,"Yes, socialist. Check the definition. I don't watch Fox. Is that the best you can do?"
4819,sarc,It also isn't a baby yet either. It is called a fetus.
4820,sarc,"The first Christians were Jews. Anyone who claims to be a Christian but hates Jews is a XXXXX. An anti-Semetic Christian is like an oxymoron term. And an Aryan is supposed to be someone with blue-eyes, brown-hair, and light-skin. You don't have to believe in 'Aryanism' to be Aryan, and the mortal enemies of Aryans are not Jews. 'Aryans' may hate Jews, but most Jews aren't bigoted. By the way, Hitler did not like just Jews but others he considered 'inferior' to the 'superior' 'Aryan race.'   Do some actual research instead of pulling XXXX out of the air to conform to your screwed up opinions."
4821,sarc,"Well, look who's all pompous about something, and still get it wrong. Either way, earth or universe, you are still wrong, as for many decades the age of the universe has been put in the high single digits to the teens. We have never claimed it was 4 billion years old, that would just be retarted, as that is the age of the earth. Maybe you should check your facts and make sure you don't get them wrong whentrying to argue about the subject."
4822,sarc,After reading that I had to go talk to Ralph on the big white telephone.
4823,sarc,"Try the ( Law of Common Sense) . If your an ex-atheist, you already know the ( Law of Relativity )."
4824,sarc,"I think it would be best for neither one to have a gun, as there would be no chance of me getting hurt. After all, I could beat up a guy armed with a plastic fork. However, if the hijacker has a gun, I'd like someone (not me, I'm half blind in each eye, I'd probably hit a passanger or something) to have a gun."
4825,sarc,"Well, I guess you got something there. . . . . .can't put the cart before the hose!!"
4826,sarc,"You are, in effect, telling me that putting someone in a position that will inevitable leave them dead does not make you responsible for their death. If I fire a bullet at your head, while that bullet is in mid-air, I am no longer doing anything to hurt you, and you are fine. However, I have set in motion affects that will result in your demise. This makes me responsible for your death."
4827,sarc,"Actually they apologised because it's a bit of a fad amongst the limp-wristed politicians at the moment. And anyway, the blood is fairly even on both sides."
4828,sarc,"I know that. Evolution releases itself from its foundation at will. When it wants to speculate about things like abiogenesis and claim it to be science, it allows itself to do that. It's that interchangeability thing you spoke of above."
4829,sarc,I see. Then what you are claiming is that creationists are the ones who should define the vocabulary to be used by evolutionary biologists. Would it then be ok for atheists to define the vocabulary of Christianity?
4830,sarc,Like you were raised? Looks like it didn't work and now those hormones must be kicking in? Nothing worse than a menopausal female grinding her ax...their favorite victims? Males.
4831,sarc,"It truly is sad when an opponent is friendlier than an ally, Mega. At least Ian responded in a friendly way, and me and him don't even agree on this issue."
4832,sarc,"So...all Christians have some sort of brain damage, trebor? You're not getting any better at this are you?"
4833,sarc,"And it will, I guess, take an amendment to deny rights to and make a whole segment of the population second class citizens."
4834,sarc,First of all a man cannot terminate tissue he isn't carrying.The father can opt out all he wants but when that fetus becomes a born person he is responsible just like the mother is.
4835,sarc,"That ""somebody"" was a Jesuit priest, the idea met some initial resistance because of it's religious overtones. But the overwhelming evidence in favor of it carried the day. You should study some history too."
4836,sarc,"He didn't pursue the ""master race of white Protestant."" He was a pure Aryanist, genius one. The very least you could do is get your facts straight, but you probably like spreading this bullcrap on purpose. (Seeing as how you're an atheist.)"
4837,sarc,"Yes an I am sure you love unbridled capitalism, cruel self centred people do. Capitalism is a cruel system that kills people, lets them starve, makes them homeless, and exploits the poor for the gain of a few."
4838,sarc,I note the bolding but the reason for it is as inscrutable as the peculiar form of what appears to be English which is used.
4839,sarc,"well, then why are the doctors trying 2 also test the embyonic cells? what's their reason then? we don't know, because the doctors might not want everything that they're doing be on the front page of every newspaper. they have their reasons for their actions, and they just don't want people like you to know about them. or...they already have their reasons published and everything and you're just 2 close-minded 2 take the information in."
4840,sarc,I'm glad that you're the one living in fear of becoming a criminal for defending your family and not me.
4841,sarc,"Sure Justine, just like all those gay couples that waited until their state recognized gay marriage to tie the knot on TV. And then once the media got tired of it it's died down to a trickle in Massachusetts . . .   Marriage as a political lobbyists' tool isn't too sacred IMO."
4842,sarc,"what other forest? By your logic there would only be one left in the entire world, and it would be what, the size on central park?"
4843,sarc,"No. I'll type slowly so I don't get ahead of you this time. Follow with your finger and move your lips if no one is watching. Scientists get to define what they mean by the scientific words that they use. Not you and not your preacher. Do I get to define what you mean by the word ""prayer?"" Why not?"
4844,sarc,"Oh, oh, and don't forget to include the proposed Federal Kosher Amendment's text, which just coincidentally matches the Levitical proscriptions, in your argument that things like the FMA have nothing to do with separation of church and state."
4845,sarc,I'll give you that one...only because I think by then women will be able to place their fertilized ovums in banks.   But then again they said the same thing about robot servants and flying cars too!
4846,sarc,"No need. As soon as I see that a thread is started by supersport, that's what I already expect to happen within a few days. I'm sure I'm not the only one."
4847,sarc,"He wasn't trying to. Shooterandproud may be an unreasonable gun nut, but he accepts evolution."
4848,sarc,Fine... go live in China. Live in their socialism. Enjoy your 2 an hour!
4849,sarc,"Which wouldn't make a darn bit of difference - apart from the tiny matter of women dying and suffering permanent harm, but don't let that bother you. you'll also have to amend the constitution to remove any references to bodily autonomy. get ready to donate your kidney!"
4850,sarc,"Feel free samiinh. After all, chemist asked me the same question just yesterday pertaining to the same subject. And the same question about being angry at an allegedly non existent God applies to you too."
4851,sarc,"You mean Priests? Because I hear the ladies are crawling all over them, can't get enough of that catholic loving..."
4852,sarc,"Ah yes, adopting the Nazi Germany policy of encouraging neighbors to snitch on others, to reward tattle tails for violating the trust of others and invading privacy."
4853,sarc,You your qualifications in logic allow you to judge that? I suspect that you are talking out of your elbow since I haven't seen any evidence that you know what logic is. Mostly I see hysteria and superstition in your posts.
4854,sarc,"Well I gotta hand it to you, Matt, you're consistent."
4855,sarc,"So, then you DO feel that what you did was a sin. Otherwise you wouldn't have asked forgiveness for it.   I have one question. What was your motivation for starting this thread? Was it to try and somehow prove that a person can be a Christian and have an abortion? Just curious. IMO, you are right that you are forgiven for it, as God is a forgiving and loving God. But I hope you don't do it again."
4856,sarc,"Oh my goodness. This is a trick called semantics.   I guess you got sucked in.   Yes, abortion is used as contraception unfortunately."
4857,sarc,"Actually, that honour is reserved for the usual representations of those who advocate young earth creationism."
4858,sarc,WHAT QUOTES??? That's what I was asking you to repost because I can't find anything intelligent you have either posted or quoted at all!
4859,sarc,"So you are pro-life and you hate liberals? Actually Republicans are being liberal in this case (liberal=bigger government, more laws).   But I'll assume you mean Democrats on this. What if the baby is a democrat? If it's a democratic parent it's most likely it will grow up democratic and one more person to attempt to keep abortion legal."
4860,sarc,And we have an emotional post with no substance whatsoever. I'm sure your twin will be checking in soon. I think I'll keep a count of this type of post.
4861,sarc,"So, all knowledge is ignorance, and all events not in the present are ignorance. I'm not following you here. How about we leave the definitions as they are, so that we can differentate true from false? Calling everything ignorance doesn't move us forward in the debate. If we accepeted your claim, we are typing ignorance and concuding ignorance, so what would the point be?"
4862,sarc,"I have never, and will never stand for reasonable gin control laws. After all, I hate vodka martini's."
4863,sarc,"So, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? Gimme a break. He supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. In case you haven't noticed, the majority of Americans are against gay marriage."
4864,sarc,"Oh goody. Some more of your well informed opinion based on wishful thinking, no research and even less actual thought. Probably the bird you are talking about is the Cormorant (Nannopterum harrisi). Yes, it is flightless because it has no need to fly. There were no natural preditors in the Galapagos and the bird is a sea bird. It swims and eats fish. It's wings are much reduced because it swims by kicking rather than by ""flying"" through the water like a penguin. Like the penguin it is a diving bird."
4865,sarc,Oh thats not politically kerect and secially wif the chosen one doing the world apology toure I don't see that going down.   Well lay a few on us sin baby. Give us the deal.
4866,sarc,And Sotomayor argued that the American people have absolutely no right to defend themselves. What's your point?
4867,sarc,"And the scientific papers don't. The problem here is that creationists don't read the scientific papers. In fact, most can't even understand them."
4868,sarc,Just three months. Man you have to be the best biology teacher in the world. Where did you learn to pull off a miracle like that?
4869,sarc,"You can believe what you want, your beliefs are not relevant to the issue."
4870,sarc,So you'd ask on these issues even if you didn't know if they had signed it?
4871,sarc,Just be like the Jews and Christians and steal the idea! A lot of their mythology isn't original: it was stolen from other people who thought it up first.
4872,sarc,"Nope. However, he does get to pay child support if he gets caught."
4873,sarc,"Yes, I know all about Dr Dino. He is a fraud and con."
4874,sarc,Note the word calls! In several! Many! Get it! This was a terror tactic that their very own Police department REFUSED! Well. Until it was all over that is!   That is why I asked the hard questions.   Is this the kind of protection we hope for when we call our very own police?
4875,sarc,"Now you are being insulting. Evolution makes no statments about your god. For that matter, neither does cosmology, astronomy, chemistry, physics or geology."
4876,sarc,"Doesn't count. Took place in a ""gun free zone"". By law no guns are allowed there, so by law this incident couldn't take place."
4877,sarc,Oh. Then you're just a dupe rather than being dishonest. Your information comes from a moonie. Funny that the Discovery Institute doesn't mention that. The fact that he decided to study biology with the express purpose of disproving evolution. So he had made up his mind that it was wrong before he undertook to find out what is was. Wells was encouraged by the Rev. Moon. He is known selective presentation of data.
4878,sarc,But what makes them any different from ant hills or beaver dams? skyscrapers are natural because humans are a part of nature and they built them.
4879,sarc,So now those that are opposed to even more laws on the books and a return to Old Testament practices are considered left wing? What's this world coming too? LOL
4880,sarc,"I am willing to look at you, me and anyone and tell them if they are not prepared to love and nurture what is produced by sex, don't have it.   If you are, get it on."
4881,sarc,"Well, in the case of a creationist, the bias determines what evidence will be discarded, what evidence will be twisted, what evidence will simply be ignored."
4882,sarc,Find me a mass shooting in Utah where concealed carry on campus is legal.
4883,sarc,Even Joe the plumber abandoned the garbage scow? Say it aint so!
4884,sarc,"And that's why I think you are a troll. There really aren't any experts here. There are several who are knowledgable in a variety of topics, but that knowledge seems to me to be the result of being both educated and widely read. It also indicates an ability to reason and an open mind."
4885,sarc,"Look what is talking about insane, immune to reason, a prisnor of his own giant ignorance, slavery fetishist and one of the comic relief 3 stooges. You might have a dialogue but then insult isn't part of one. No one gives a rat's patoot about your opinion. If it were your country maybe they would but I doubt it. Mean while eat your heart out as you rail in fear about us buying and keeping arms."
4886,sarc,And I would appreciate your refraining from calling your mythology a theory.
4887,sarc,"NO it is not. Evolution occurs and has been observed. Apparently you missed high school biology or else took it in Texas (in our class she said there were 2 versions of the same video, one for Texas where it didn't even mention the word evolution)."
4888,sarc,"Seeing the article you linked to was written in 2002, over three years ago, do you think the author could perhaps incorporate the new data and rename his piece, ""Maybe There Is Some Truth About Pedophile Priests After All""?"
4889,sarc,Funny how you haven't had a literature or history class recently. Would you like me to contact the several history and literature/English teachers in my school and ask them if they credit Homer as the actual author of those epics?
4890,sarc,"Kudos on the arrogant, hateful stereotyping, wabbit. Ask around. Not all of the ""infidels"" on IIDB are atheists. If you can't even get Oolon's name right, you clearly haven't spent enough time there to know. In fact, everyone should just go to Oolon's page of God's Greatest Mistakes and see for themselves."
4891,sarc,"Doesn't matter if it is 5 months or 8 months (all of which is done) or 1 month...it is a person inside another...why does that make a difference? I suppose you are a ""cancer"" too? So I guess we assume you comment should read "" Her body her choice so long as she is not inside another person and none of anyone elses business."" Surely is a random thought but I would like to have one of my own. I think that if I kill someone else in my own home then it is no one elses business but my own. Sound weird?? I agree...just like your statement."
4892,sarc,Mr. Brown was able to attend ball games. Not exactly held captive was he?
4893,sarc,"Good point. If she is old enough to be licenced to drive, presumably. If she travels by bus, train or plane, are those companies complicit?"
4894,sarc,"Well, you're writing from an embryo's point of view, when an embryo doesn't even have a point of view. It would be like writing from a rock's point of view."
4895,sarc,"If I ever see Arch defend a position at EvC I will eat my hat and the hat of my fiance, too."
4896,sarc,"And would you care to tell us just what those ""official ideological goals"" are and where we might find a certifiable copy of them?"
4897,sarc,"Where, exactly, did the article say that bacteria exhibit intelligence????"
4898,sarc,Before you were claiming it was a slippery slope. Now you're claiming it's a strawman. Perhaps you don't understand what either term means.
4899,sarc,Did the Prohibition stop drinking? Did the drug war stop smoking? What makes you think it is different with guns?
4900,sarc,Is it productive an exericee to make such generalisations which are in effect a product of a priori notions that anyone who is religious is irrational anyway?
4901,sarc,"Actually what sank that debate was a bunch of paleontologists from K state who started arguing for punctuated equilibrium. That was pretty much the end. I remember one board member was quoted as saying ""These are public schools. We are luck if we can teach the kids to read"""
4902,sarc,And if the majority supported banning Christianity would that be ok just because the majority supports it? Civil rights should not be up for a vote ever no matter what.
4903,sarc,"Don't get your panties in a wad, 38 State Attorney Generals signed a brief in opposition to any gun control this clown can dream up."
4904,sarc,Actually in terms of populations we're the same people as the Irish. If you want tyranny try the oppression of the Native Americans. Did you know that the Natives and the blacks were both on the British side during the War of Independence? Amazing how we tyrants command such free support huh....
4905,sarc,"But that is a misunderstanding of what the big bang theory is. What it isn't is an explosion. I don't suppose you have actually studied any astrophysics or astronomy upon which you base your rejection of the big bang, have you?"
4906,sarc,Everyone is welcome to give their opinion on public gun possession here-whether you're for or against gun control (or does gun possession justifies itself) and please state the reasons as well. I would really appreciate it if you guys could include some extra informations regarding this issue.
4907,sarc,"but you too are a figment of my imagination, and you only think you are a giant alien dreaming about this world because i imagined you as such. you cannot disprove this either."
4908,sarc,And it remains to be seen if your are. Pick an unreasonable and dumb argument go with it.
4909,sarc,"Ha, that is just an idiotic perspective. We'd have no laws (and many important ones) if you can't make a bill that doesn't affect you. Sorry Civil Rights legislation!"
4910,sarc,"My my, did someone get up on the wrong side of the bed or what, of course you realize that you just gave me the answer I was looking for, not that I didnt already know the answer, I just wanted you to say it. I dont believe I need a clue, so I will let you have it instead Brady."
4911,sarc,And yet it's usually the liberal democrats who are in favor of murdering innocent children...
4912,sarc,You have conviced no one or even come remotely to forming an argument.
4913,sarc,"Well Clive, I will formally invite them here........ I don't know if any of them will take my invitation seriously, but we will see."
4914,sarc,Bertvan: Does this self-organization force whip up complex features intelligently and purposefully? Or does it whip them up by some unknown deterministic process in which creativity is somehow achieved by accident?
4915,sarc,"Well such a compelling speech ( cough cough ) but this whole small children being involed is irrellivent, since it is the parents moral responsibility to ""lock all guns and ammo in sperate safes or cabinats"" qouting the gun and hunter safety quizes. That and I would also like to make a clear statement on my childhood, I have been around guns well since I was born... Yet I don't have an extra breathing hole in my head either, so it aint the guns its the parents who don't teach there kids proper gun safety and to NEVER PLAY WITH GUNS! qouting the NRA saftey tips."
4916,sarc,"So you deny that this man is a victim? Realize that the gunshot drew attention, and attention is something criminals don't want. Maybe without that gunshot, the guy would've been beaten to death. But I suppose you'd be happier, because at least the old man wasn't a gun owner. Or I suppose you think he should've let the criminal have the money; all that is needed for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing."
4917,sarc,"yea...it's like ordering a pizza. First the paleontologist digs up a bone or other artifact...then he calls the lab, tells them what he found and gives them the date they can expect the bone to arrive for ""testing."" Then the lab asks him from what organism the bone once belonged and also what toppings, I mean dates, he wants for his bone. Then the paleontologist gives him the range of dates that most suit his presuppositions.....Then the paleontologists sends in the bone fed-ex, along with a gift-certificate to the finest steakhouse in town and two tickets to the ballgame, and then sits back and waits for the results. Finally, just to be on the safe side, the paleontologist repeats this scenario with at least 2 more labs...this way just in case one doesn't cooperate he has backup and he can pick a date from any number of labs."
4918,sarc,"The vast majority of scientists do not believe in Creationism, and all those people you listed who say there are only 2 varients evolution or creationism--they are't anthropological or theological experts. All they know is their westernized view. Their opinions have no reflection on Biology in that sense. THey should stick to Biology. There is only 1 true way--that's evolution. THe other's are wishful thinking, whether they be the primordial flood, the divine parrot, or magic god who made people from dust."
4919,sarc,"Could you be so kind as to point out the holes, please? Or are you going to dance around some more?"
4920,sarc,None... unless she uses abortion as a form of birth control and has them regularly.
4921,sarc,Every time the KKK burns a cross NRA members are there. So what? Every time they burn a cross Christianity is there.
4922,sarc,No surprise there. You would have to invest some thought to define something. Why don't you just consult your Little Golden Dictionary?
4923,sarc,So this singularity that appeared out of no were became a greater singularity which took on perfect balance and form?
4924,sarc,"I did, you rejected my evidence with your usual excuses. Now, tell me about the big bang."
4925,sarc,"And teen sex doesn't, by the very nature of it's action, result in ending a life that would grow into a toddler, a child, an adolescent, and an adult--basically the action of killing someone."
4926,sarc,Just another bogus reason for having and abortion............There are thousands of them.........
4927,sarc,"He stated that "" statistics show that firearms cause aggression in individuals"", no mention of the word can anywhere in there that I saw."
4928,sarc,"So atheists are capable of goodness, love, kindness, generosity and sympathy but they have no meaning unless one conforms the the fundamentalist christian morality."
4929,sarc,78.4 years? Well excuse me but I intend to live much longer than that. I was thinking about 112.7 years. Yeah. That's about right.
4930,sarc,"See, this is the same logic used by the slaver owners. If one believes slavery is wrong then what right does he have to impose that on someone else?"
4931,sarc,"Yep when about 99.99% of a cows diet is grass...I guess we should be eating that instead.   It is hard to urinate in one corner of the toilet. If all ground that is being used for livestock is ""wonderfully transformed"" into grain production there will be many many wild species that will go extinct due to lack of uncultivated land."
4932,sarc,"We don't take him seriously anymore because despite having been refuted over and over (both here and on at least four other boards), he still posts the same garbage. Whenever it looks like there has been overwhelming refutation of his thread, he abandons it and starts a new one saying basically the same thing as the one before it. THAT is why he isn't taken seriously, and no, it is not ""unfair"". I also have to ask why you think he puts so much intelligence into his posts, when all he does is either cut and paste from some anti-evolution site, or say things like ""science is a joke"" My pet dog could do better."
4933,sarc,"In my lifetime, we've made huge strides, but there's a lot more to learn."
4934,sarc,But you still feel they have the right idea when it comes to firearms?
4935,sarc,Are you referring to yourself as a Christian or Steeeeve being a Christian?
4936,sarc,"Nor is there any need for some mythical molecular elemental, nebulas natural selection, or mystical transitionals based on peicemeal forensics and antithestic rhetoric."
4937,sarc,Wow ehat a brave new world you live in.... Now lets say just 1% of all gun owners resisted (in the us that is several hundred thousand peppered through the land). With media attention to such infighting between government and citizens how do you deal with this?
4938,sarc,"I am sure you meant ""mediate"" instead of ""medicate"" ? Or, is OSU a medical school? Or, did you know the man was off his meds? Exactly what does your rant mean other than you are so frustrated if you hear of a shooting in a Republic of over 3 million it drives you batty? How many kids drowned in 5 gallon buckets between your two posts? How many in car wrecks? How many from blunt objects or knives? Actually, death by guns is far down the list so why is it you go bananas when you hear of a shooting even if someone is killed or not? You do understand there are justifiable shootings also?"
4939,sarc,"But that is how creationism works - half truth. Evolution is a theory but don't make it quite clear that in science the word theory doesn't mean half-assed guess, as it does in creationism. Check out that little piece of **** that was added to the bottom of the Patterns of Cumulative Change paragraph on page 7. That is pure YEC. And you aren't a YEC?"
4940,sarc,And yet the post-Dunblane handgun ban happened after only one event.
4941,sarc,And irrational emotional appeals seldom hold up in the face of logic
4942,sarc,"Confused? First you say you don't believe in killing children unless it's ""absolutly (sic) necessary"", then you say you can't imagine a time that it would be absolutely necessary. Can't you make up your mind?"
4943,sarc,"you told me in an earlier post that the mother should die, even if they predict the fetus will kill the mother. your bible states otherwise."
4944,sarc,Oh? And what is the specific amount of pot you have to smoke before you become a drug crazed fiend?
4945,sarc,More silliness on your part. Think about it. Gay couples together for 40 or 50 years. That means they were living together in the 1950s and 1960s. Those people were the foundation of the gay-pride movement.
4946,sarc,"So we kill the baby instead? Interesting idea. How about instead we reform the fostor and adoption care system. No, people arn't looking for healthy, white infants, they are looking for infants. This automatically reduces 90% of adoption cases. The so called ""Healthy white infants"" make up 70% of all adoption cases, seeing that 30% of abortion are done by blacks, and latinos and most minorities don't have abortions, but instead keep their children."
4947,sarc,"Excuse me, I stand corrected. For 'pretend' please substitute 'wrongly believe'."
4948,sarc,"So if a story in the bible is proven to be true, like the fact that there is enough water in the ice caps, and the atmosphere to cover the highest mountains, then these ""myths"" would become less rediculous? Or would there be a logical explanation other than a higher life form did it? Mayabe a crazy man built a big boat at the right time and happened to have two of each animal at the time? But that would be crazy talk. Wouldnt it?"
4949,sarc,Most of the laws of the Peoples Republic of Kalifornia are aimed at rendering the citizens into prey. You can't point to many that don't. Self defense is not allowed there I am afraid.
4950,sarc,"So somebody try and tell us, that with stuff like this going on, that America still needs to overhaul its gun laws to bring them more in line with those of Mexico."
4951,sarc,"Demolishing your ""rebuttal"" in post #14 does, however. You missed it."
4952,sarc,Oh damn it...and I was going to sell this joke and retire!
4953,sarc,"why are you afraid of guns? has one jumped up and shot at you? you should never fear a gun, respect the gun."
4954,sarc,"god, this has been argued against a thousand times. by this deffinition masterbation is killing, menstration is involentary manslauter. by this deffinition you kill someone every time you walk by a carrot without eating it."
4955,sarc,No brother...complete controll of everything you do by a power structure you'll be powerless to stop. Enjoy!
4956,sarc,"You mean a strawman logic fallacy, right? Yeah that would require me using a statementnot a question. But at least you tried."
4957,sarc,"Well, considering how ambiguous and contradictory the Christian scriptures are, I guess this interpetation makes as much sense as any of the others."
4958,sarc,"Oh yeah right, like sociopaths who are bent on killing and slaughtering everyone around them, can be fixed with something as stupid as school counseling."
4959,sarc,"And because this man said it, it must be true? A simple appeal to authority."
4960,sarc,"Oh, gee! There goes my irony meter. It pegged and started smoking at the end of the first sentence. Archy is just being christian by trying to impose his twisted morality on everyone."
4961,sarc,If the same question had been posed by different polls over time it would be easier to draw trends from the responses..... but good luck with finding some trends in amongst that lot.
4962,sarc,"Anyone can ""give consent"". The issue is wether the parson is old enough to make that decission. I bet the children Michael Jackson raped gave their consent. Does that make it ""allright""? Are the kids ""mature enough"" to take the consequences of those actions?"
4963,sarc,"Well since Bush took office the mantra has bee ""Local Control"" has it not. Apparently the people of your state want whats happening. Local control in action. Rejoice in your victory."
4964,sarc,"Gee, and in what year did he state that? 2005? No way. 2000? No. 1995? Nope. 1990? Nah. 1985? Couldn't be. Without more information I can give an exact date, but seeing as how Simpson died in 1984, he must have said that at least 21 years ago (and if he said it in the middle of his life/career, it would have been more like 60 years ago!) - he did not know back then what we now know."
4965,sarc,"Well, this guy is so bad ad arguing and so good at alienating people that if we sent him into the abortion forum, it is likely, he'd be so ineffective at defending his pro-life position thathe'd actually be contributing to the pro-choice position..."
4966,sarc,"How do you ""interpret"" all those extant historical records bracketing the ""flood"" date by several hundred years, as shown by sinjin, which record no such event?"
4967,sarc,"But you have challenged science with your beliefs. You argue against science with your beliefs, based on mythology with no evidential support. You argue against real science so that you can cling to your fairy tales."
4968,sarc,"Please be sure to give that message to all the criminals out there. We wouldn't like to have the situation where all the law abiding citizens got rid of their guns and the criminals kept them, would we?"
4969,sarc,But did you consider it relative when you posted this on another thread?:
4970,sarc,And you're a poor replacement for that koolaid-drinking Seer Travis.
4971,sarc,And you are only trying to earn yourself brownie points in hell.
4972,sarc,"Show of hands, how many people think that is the same story?   Flood Stories from Around the World"
4973,sarc,"You are like, so totally noble and sensitive! I really admire your pro-humanity stance. That is going out on limb."
4974,sarc,"The Book of Genesis is either secular or observed history? Somebody get marc a dictionary, please. (And I'd link him to a long list of observed instances of speciation, but he'd ignore it yet again.)"
4975,sarc,When the political right was taken over by the religious right.
4976,sarc,Because electricity moves faster than a man's arm? Give me one example of this actually happening and I'll concede that it's not a ridiculous thing to consider.
4977,sarc,"Gun Control is not on this list of crime contributing factors. However banning guns would leave the law-abiding defenseless in the face of these criminal predators. Why don't you work for changing these conditions instead of working for something that has no effect on reducing crime (gun control).   However, if you think you can prove gun control will work as crime control, then go for it! Maybe you can cower us with your overwhelming evidence."
4978,sarc,Just as being anti-gun won't compensate for being born with a small brain.
4979,sarc,"Good. But seeing how this was proposed over a century and a half ago by Darwin, what took the creationists so long to catch up?"
4980,sarc,so you think it would be ok to fire people for being secular atheists?
4981,sarc,A 6ft tall mugger vs an old man. The muggers hands are leathal weapons vs an old man.   Let's see. The criminal got away and the old man is being charged with a crime? Do you see anything wrong with that?
4982,sarc,"So why did you say pot was worse than alcohol? Just because both are apparently bad, doesn't make one 'worse'. I'll point out that you compared the two first, so saying it's dumb to compare the two's shooting yourself in the foot."
4983,sarc,And yet here we are and neo-Darwinism continues to have empirical support right and left with no sign of it being falsified in sight as of yet. Why might that be? And you Bertvan do not exist since you are so highly improbable. Therefore I can safely assume that your post above just happened without your existense.
4984,sarc,"...which -- although a very good point when it comes to refuting creationist claptrap -- is not even the major issue of this forum. Undesirable consequences of an effect do not make that effect false or nonexistent. Gravity ""breeds"" falling deaths, which are bad, so let's maintain that gravity doesn't exist..."
4985,sarc,"Oh, please show me this. I wait with bated breath for you to provide the quotation in which I ""assumed"" that evolution has been ""disproved"" I'm really looking forward to your providing of this. Until then, you aren't worth my time, strawman."
4986,sarc,"If guns do kill, then why should we arrest the people instead of the guns?"
4987,sarc,How is one supposed to be smugly self-righteous if this is the case? No fair.
4988,sarc,"As if a mentally incapacitated/incompetent would be allowed to retain the rank of major, and actually be scheduled for deployment into a war zone on active duty."
4989,sarc,Well with thinking challenged individuals like slimjim floating around it is no wonder we have a rogue agency with no oversight attacking the honest citizens. See Ruby Ridge and Waco for examples.
4990,sarc,"Why is it left to me to have to respond to this? I guess the question is, what is she petrified of?"
4991,sarc,"Oh, ok, I can be politically correct if it makes you feel better. How about I refer to them as ""intelligence deficient"". And I was really not referring to bona fide ""retarded"" individuals (those with true pathology). I agree that there is nothing funny about that. How about I refer to them as people who drive like XXXXXX...Is that better?"
4992,sarc,"He was big on ""Turn the other cheek"", the pacifist non-gunner."
4993,sarc,"Except for other inmates, guards, medical staff, etc. And no...nobody has ever escaped from prison and killed again...no...that wouldn't happen."
4994,sarc,"Because of your question "" What is your definition of pure"", I now know how to make soap. I'll never stink again!!! And I think homeopathic medicine is all about using things like vitamin c to prevent colds, and making sure you ingest lots of calcium if you are worried about ostioperosis. Ya know stuff that makes sense."
4995,sarc,"No Doc. Obama will be happy for Reo. It is compassionate, Social justice stuff, and all!"
4996,sarc,"There's more to this story. The doctors who performed the abortion and the girl's mother, were excommunicated from the Catholic Church. And get this: the stepfather who raped his stepdaughter since she was six was NOT excommunicated, because by the Church's logic, what he did was not as bad! But you know, given the way women are dealt with in their holy book, I shouldn't be surprised. http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/0...n.html?ref=rss"
4997,sarc,"You mean on the road shared with the adjacent property they claim as tribal land? Mr. Brown was able to attend ball games. Not exactly held captive was he? Where in Canada is it illegal to defend yourself with a firearm, given sufficient threat? And what did the Indians do to the Brown's to justify using deadly force?"
4998,sarc,No surprises that an unemployed former public servant would support increasing the amount he leeches off everyone else. It's a joke this is even something people would think about at this point. The titanic's sinking and you're thinking about whether to ask for a room with lilac lampshades.
4999,sarc,"also josephdphillips sterilization would be automatically part of the process after the family has two kids. didn't mention it originally, but probably a good idea, since what would stop them otherwise?"
5000,sarc,So much for the idea of the more helpless you make yourself the safer you are eh!
5001,sarc,"Yeah, ok, keep up with your ""Creationist"" therory and I'll stick to my much more believable idea of ""Evolution."" Keep your religion out of MY Government!"
5002,sarc,"You forgot one. For trying to bring eugenics to the US. We wouldn't want those ""poor negros"" reproducing now would we?"
5003,sarc,"Well nobody has turned up the Ark have they, termites could assure that if properly used. After 40 days and more they would be ravenous."
5004,sarc,"Well, I think I will be sending Satan a snow shovel about now. We actually agree on something. It is ""inconceivable"" (to quote ""the Princess Bride"")"
5005,sarc,"So you think it is a good idea for public schools to assume the role of parents? Perhaps you would support a balance then. Given what you say here, you wouldn't think it a bad idea for the New Hampshire School System to take a field trip to the local Catholic church would you? You know, so kids can know what resources, agencies, and organizations are available to them in the event that they may need to interact with them in the future. The School Board apparently gets the message, however. According to the article, it has instructed school administrators to investigate the matter, and determine whether disciplinary action is necessary. I would think it is."
5006,sarc,"... If we allow passengers to have guns, then the terrorists will use guns, not boxcutters. Besides, I highly doubt plane passengers will allow hijackers who only have blades to fly planes into buildings anymore."
5007,sarc,You obviously don't read many posts. Why is this relevant?
5008,sarc,"My first thought on reading this was ""What is Comfort thinking?"".... Then I remembered he has faith instead."
5009,sarc,"My God! Archy isn't even aware of the centuries of quibbling and waffling and just-so answers that have gone on among theologians about the problem of evil. It seems that he has never read Augustine, Aquinas, and on and on. He isn't even aware that there is even a name for arguments about the problem. It is called Theodicy."
5010,sarc,good thing this argument has never been done!...oh wait. With that logic we should make everything legal. You are much better off making theft legal and safe (no more guns needed!) than to have it illegal and dangerous.
5011,sarc,"Quit using movie stars. After Kerry lost, a lot of them got a bad rap and are generally annoying. You're better off corrupting politicians, like that would be hard anyway."
5012,sarc,So then will you go the way on liberty (repeal stoopid laws) or tyranny (enact more unconstitutional laws)?
5013,sarc,"I dunno, I keep seeing more and more chinese around here!! And they all have 3 kids! They come over here just so they can breed. They invade a host that is more favorable for replication. Viral! [please, this is a joke, any chinese out there, just a joke!]"
5014,sarc,I also took a look and think your evaluation is charitable.
5015,sarc,"No, its not. Thats a strawman. I have never stated anything of the sort. You just cannot debate honestly. I never said that since one argument is wrong, that all are wrong. I am saying that I can prove all the arguments wrong independantly. Not that I have to. Now, any of you able to give even a hint of an intelligent answer to the OP? Or does that shatter your delusion that you dont support murdering children?"
5016,sarc,"The judge should be informed that 'the leading' IDist admits that ID is religion. (yes, I've posted this before...) What else could an unembodied designer, which naturalism perforce excludes, be but a deity? So Dembski's ID has one or more unspecified deities - supernatural, unembodied designers - creating biological systems, at some unknown time, at some unknown place, by some unknown series of steps. What a great scientific theory! :-)"
5017,sarc,"I actually agree. Make it legal and sign away your rights. However - there are plenty of fathers who opt....... ""Deadbeat Dad"" is practically a profession."
5018,sarc,"Free traders, rummers, smugglers, disdainers of law, pirates, essentially. But wait! Weren't the pirates a Marxist lot? Aren't there rumors about Black Beard and his communistic leanings? Smugglers And Smuggling in Cornwall"
5019,sarc,"Do a little math here: http://education.yahoo.com/reference...sp/popula.html Minus: 500,000 est, who marched in this protest. Leaves at LEAST 39,500,000 who did NOT march. Further into the article: Read it for yourself. http://www.commondreams.org/cgi-bin/...05/0422-08.htm"
5020,sarc,"I think I understand this. The goal is clear, check. Self-restraint is good, check. But I do not see what this has to do with the OP. Could you explain, please? Who are you recommending should use self-restraint? The protestors? Or are you saying, self-restraint is your recommendation for birth control?"
5021,sarc,"Indeed, Fellow Pastafarian, will those christians ever learn?: And indeed, DamEtel, fellow skeptic, will they ever learn? The answer is no. So... cheers."
5022,sarc,"I think we're seeing a culture war. Hardly seems a fair fight though, since only one side has any.:p"
5023,sarc,"As the ""leak"" appears to have happened SIXTEEN YEARS AGO, she may have difficulty catching up with that."
5024,sarc,well that won't help you when you go to hell...Woo hoo
5025,sarc,"Reading comprehension not among your skill sets eh simone? Splain to us how this 2000+ page monster is going to relieve the problem will you. While you are at it, let us know where you got your fitional 50 million number. Lots of people will die, insurance is no guarantee of life baby. Get real"
5026,sarc,Does a bear **** in the woods? Does the Pope live in Rome?
5027,sarc,"Not according to your propaganda. All lefties want more and more government, they want a total nannystate government. You can't have it both ways."
5028,sarc,"Oh they are? Thats strange... I could not find where exactly they stand on any of thier numerous websites, just more restrictions... And the old HCI was not ""moderate"""
5029,sarc,You don't view infants as people either? What form of beast are you?
5030,sarc,"Now settle down charlie, and try to think rationally, just for a second. Have you ever heard of a tumor growing into a sentient life form as a fetus does? I'd appreciate a link documenting such an occurrence so we pro-lifers can start planning save the tumor rally's."
5031,sarc,"Why is that a good reason for this sort of law? What's the sense in removing the rights of citizens just to make a cop's job easier? Do you also support repealing the Fourth and Fifth Amendments (or the Canadian equivalent, if they have it), just to make cops' jobs easier? Allowing cops to use torture in interrogations would also make their jobs easier. Would you support that?"
5032,sarc,So it's your contention that hundreds of thousands of firearms stolen from residences annually is just par for the course?
5033,sarc,"Well if no siege comes, I guess no harm no foul."
5034,sarc,"Uh oh, Mr. Poe's proclamation crashes and burns right there - the Bible says no such thing. This is where a satire quickly changes from something that starts out as mocking, (designed to be something that could be innocence) to a complete lie. It never takes long for atheist satirists to demonstrate their lack of knowledge of the Bible. Atheist mockers dont seem to be quite as skilled as Mr Poe would have us believe."
5035,sarc,"PROJECTION, again.... I'm amazed you can't recognise the amount you do it...."
5036,sarc,"'Life threatening condition that is always physically harmful""? What a giant load of steamy BS. Rarely is pregnancy physically harmful and even rarer is it life threatening. There are over 6 Billion people on this earth today. If motherhood was so damn dangerous, don't you think the population would be a lot lower, even if it was just due to mothers keeling over after giving birth? Where do you get this BS from, Planned Parenthood?"
5037,sarc,Oh he won't read that... This American in exile (does not even live here anymore) just disappears for a while whe the heat is on only to resurface with his same propaganda after the heat has died down.
5038,sarc,"Do you think that being allowed to marry your favorite sheep would undermine the institution of marriage? How about the ability to marry multiple partners? Or do you think that nothing is capable of undermining the institution of marriage? Just trying to gauge your level of sincerity. And sanity.
"
5039,sarc,"So there you have an example of a deterministic system acting to suprise you with unpredictable behavior. Consider it an example of deterministic ""free-will"""
5040,sarc,The VPC has a political agenda. The FBI? That is like saying I believe Coke taste better than Pepsi because the Coke commericial says so.
5041,sarc,"You know America has fallen to a disgusting low when the parasites are furious that someone's rights are not being trampled on to an equal extent to everybody elses. It would be as though during the bombing campaign on Iraq, the left were out protesting that the US hadn't killed an equal number of Israelis, to be equitable. Why even bother getting into the idiocy of someone who thinks the constitution means ""You can restrict free speech, as long as you restrict it to everybody equally, and don't do the 2nd amendment lobby any favours"", maybe they've mistaken the constitution for the communist manifesto."
5042,sarc,Oh vey! Vat du they say about the U.S. Marshals service committing more crimes than people they have actually arrested for a crime?
5043,sarc,"Well, that's at least one helluva way to say good bye."
5044,sarc,I don't drink and I'm not overweight. But I bet you have a bad habit with junk food and FOX news/couch potatoism. With a sixpack by your side.
5045,sarc,Do you have to work at becoming so scientifically illiterate? What ever happened to the creationist chant about evolution being a product of pure chance? You seem to chant all of the other creationist tripe.
5046,sarc,Oh really? <snicker> Then why don't you: 1) explain exactly how my second statement is wrong and 2) how the rest of your post was not an attempt to explain how you wrongly believed my statement to be wrong Here is your entire post:
5047,sarc,"So the fact that we still have criminals who choose to kill others, should be used against is in determining whether we can be trusted or not?"
5048,sarc,And down the road abit don't be surprised if you see Sunday Blue Laws being enacted to enforce worship on Sunday! All in the name of giving man a rest from toil of course!
5049,sarc,I feel a No True Scotsman coming on. Should I even bother to mention Hovind?
5050,sarc,"""military pattern, free-standing pistol grip:Perhaps this is what makes a regular firearm a super duper high-powered assault weapon.It could happen you know, trick up that .22lr into a .50 cal. sniper rifle.hahahahahahahahahaha."
5051,sarc,"If that was a compliment, why do I feel that I need a hot shower?"
5052,sarc,It's a self-defeating question. You're asking why numbskulls participate in numbskullery.
5053,sarc,"So if Jitobear's mother had the option to abort Jitobear in utero, you want Jitobear to have the same option with any children she carries? That's awfully progressive of you."
5054,sarc,"Well, since the definition of marriage involves ""bringing together to make one"" then that doesn't make sense. But, whatever, nothings stopping you. Marry yourself. I just did (in the eyes of god)."
5055,sarc,"And I didn't. Did you note how I explicitly put [Jesus said] for the first two quotes from the Bible, but not for the third one? Any idea why? Come on, think ... you can do it!"
5056,sarc,WND is not some guy on the internet who is 30 years old and has only had summer jobs on his resume.
5057,sarc,Good news. It seems as time goes on Arizona attempts to become more and more intolerant and bigoted. Thankfully he put an end to this one (too bad not the immigration one).
5058,sarc,Well at least you can't have a drive by swording. You can run from a sword. They are pretty tough to conceal in a bank robbery.
5059,sarc,"So you would have the mother, all four fetus's die instead. Well, just so long as your conscience is clear."
5060,sarc,So I am thinking it won't be long before we see your butt moving to New England.....look me up when ya get here!
5061,sarc,"So Steeeeve, as you have made no response in over a month I'll take your answer to my last question as a yes: More AIDS deaths are an acceptable trade for reducing access to abortion.   If you disagree, I'm all ears as to your justification."
5062,sarc,"So Steeeeve, you think that ""fewer than 1000 deaths"" per year is a reasonable price to pay for outlawing elective abortion?   And to add to what simone said figures on abortion as quoted by a site with a Roman Catholic agenda are one of the least unbiased souces of information you could cite in this debate."
5063,sarc,So a mother can kill her handicapped child? That's going in the sig.
5064,sarc,"So being easy to know makes it good? methinks that's not quite right.   Well the oldest fossils are (IIRC) 3.8 billion years old.......   Thats true, but we also don't know how the Mary Celeste came to loose its crew, but it did.   Actually, you have slipped into talking Bible here and seem to be refering to the miracle of Lazarus.   Evolution continues...... sadly for you, your lifespan means you won't see much of it happening, at least the sort of evolving that always seems to bake your noodle.   Young Earth Creationism is ""more well explained"" if we do the intellectual equivalent of sticking our fingers in our ears and yelling ""lalalalala! I can't hear you!"""
5065,sarc,So how is the oil and gas agreement with China working out for you antipodeans?
5066,sarc,"So if Geology is a fairy tale since it supports evolution, how do we find where to drill for oil or coal?"
5067,sarc,"So if you quoted Ted Kennedy when he said to his wife in an event that wasn't even publicized ""Good morning, sweetie"", that would be an answer?   I wouldn't think you'd miss (or ignore) ""anti-gun quote"", which I have emphasized in this post. Your quote was not directly implicitive against guns. It actually was more anti-war than anti-gun, even if it wasn't pro gun. I've explained this multiple times, and you completely ignored me."
5068,sarc,"So is Clemson related to Clem Kadiddlehopper or somebody else? I am afraid I have never heard of the man before.   On MY planet, it's not I who must prove existence. All the ""others"" must prove it.   I don't care if the pi/pie is square or the usual shape, round, a circle. As long as it's strawberry/rhubarb, served hot with ONE scoop of REAL vanilla ice cream........With a glass of COLD milk."
5069,sarc,"So is it safe to say you may be for pro-ignorance? With technology ANSWERS become clear.   Everything cost money. Education cost money, therefore knowledge has a price tag. Do you now suggest people don't go to College because it too is yet another EXPENSE. Society should NOT be inventing equipment that advance our intelligence.   Sonograms are great tool for understanding more to those women who have doubt. I don't know about you, but I'm all for empowerment with knowledge. Most people are ""VISUAL"" people and perhaps seeing the unborn may make the CHOICE clearer for the woman.   I'm for educating those from ALL PERSPECTIVES. Most people would rather see physcial evidence that a sonogram may provide than the RHETORIC of SLOGANS and IDEALISTIC POINTS OF VIEW.   I know your kind...""just trust me"" is your motto."
5070,sarc,So it is perfectly legal to shoot someone whom you think might possibly attack you in the future with a gun...seems if anything it is far more like removing the guns from people who can't be trusted with them.
5071,sarc,"So lemme get this straight. Terrorist agents, who have access to missile launchers, grenades, grenade launchers, heavy machine guns, and anti-aircraft cannons, all of which come from all other nations in the world...are going through the hassle of coming to America, procuring forged documentation, and buying civilian legal firearms that no army in the world has ever adopted as their main battle weapons?   Did you eat lead paint as a kid? Because nobody in full possession of their mental facilities could possibly believe this."
5072,sarc,"So newborn babies only have no Christian beliefs because Satan has removed them?   My position would be that the 'natural' (read:before external influences) state of a person is atheism, for the same reason that you 'naturally' have no belief in gremlins. People aren't born with beliefs, they are naturalised into them - whatever that belief may be."
5073,sarc," barbaric) than what Hitler did in the Holocaust?"" So once again we have a viewpoint that misses the fact that the vast majority of those exterminated by the Nazi's died under extremely unpleasant conscious circumstances? there was no mercy lost on these people, and many had been subjected to early traumas and tortures as well.How can you even compare being gassed (large chamber or small?), shot, beaten to death maybe even being killed in an experiement to test the limits of human resistance to high atmospheric pressure with aborting a foetus?Or perhaps you would care to demonstrate how a foetus that is aborted experiences any terror and pain like someone who was gassed at Auschwitz?THe crux of this is can you prove that an abortion is more barbaric than torture and death of a conscious person. "
5074,sarc,"So then how do you know that abortion isn't in the plan then? If as you say we have ""VERY LIMITED PERSPECTIVE"""
5075,sarc,"So, Jo, what is it you were saying about the UK being safer than America?"
5076,sarc,"So, Steeeeve, I take it you are not for a FAIR society?   Is an unfair society a moral society? Please explain. I find it difficult to comprehend."
5077,sarc,"So, Stststeeeee and OS, you don't like for Americans to have health care like the civilized world has?"
5078,sarc,"So, if having children isn't a requirement fro marriage, then gays should be OK, right?   If it is what it is all about, if you marry a woman who is incapable of having children, even with scientific methods, then you are not really married?   What about lesbians? They can have childre, with a little help from the local sperm bank. In facst, they can BOTH get pregnant. Does tht mean that a marriage between 2 lesbians is twice as valid?   What if a couple of gay men adopt? Then is their marriage valid?   If I have a vasectomy, am I divorced?   You are confusing me. Please explain."
5079,sarc,"Some claim, that Darwin's Evolution theory is an imaginary fairytale as others claim that Cathlic Genisis is a make-belive pack of lies. No one is right. Human life on earth was created by aliens manipulating already existing genetic materials.   PS My post is by no means intended as a serious opinion on the subject and should be treated as such. We alreadly live in strange enough word and this debate is pointless per se."
5080,sarc,"Soooo, um, pregnancies are solely a factor of a woman's behavior, eh?   No males involved?   Um, have you ever been exposed to any level of sex ed?"
5081,sarc,Sorry baby the story was in the religion of peace land. Your strawman is burning.
5082,sarc,"Sounds like an abortion bill amendment to restrict all travel by minors is needed by those demanding that young girls give birth after being impregnated by rapists, fathers, uncles, etc. Might as well include adults, just to simplify matters and enhance state police power. Bubbah will be pleased."
5083,sarc,Sounds like my 9mil. is more secure under my bed in hands reach.
5084,sarc,"Such an argument is irrelevant. Your side has never once explained why magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition are somehow ""evil"" and unfit for ownership by non-police and military personnel.   Nice try thimble head, but you fail again.   Can you prove even a single example of a criminal being unable to get their hands on a 15 round magazine after they were banned, to back up your argument?   Or maybe you'd prefer to explain why absolutely no honest citizen, who might be a victim of violent crime, doesn't deserve to have access to a magazine that holds more than 10 rounds of ammunition?"
5085,sarc,"Supersport, where art thou now...   Bah, who am I kidding. Of course he won't come over here..."
5086,sarc,"Taking away peoples right to an abortion is a great idea !!   People are confused and don't really know they want a kid, they just think they don't. It will all be alright after the kid arrives, .. they will discover we know best and keep and love and shelter these kids in a nurturing way. We know best and we know that none of them will ever just end up in a trash can or droped off at the local childrens home to join the thousands of other unwanted kids. None will ever become a pawn in a divorce situation, nore will any of them be sold into child slavery or prostitution.   How do we know all this ? .. We just know people who don't think they are ready for or want a kid really do !!   They will love and nurture it and all will be well."
5087,sarc,"Talk about incoherent wishful thinking. Instead of unsubstantiated claims and baseless attacks, why don't you provide, oh, I don't know, mybe some peer-reviewed EVIDENCE? You know, that little old thing that is required for anyone to take your wild claims even remotely seriously?"
5088,sarc,That isn't the arguement your buddy made. He claimed guns could be controlled by dogs and snakes and stuff like that.   Do you have any examples of dogs or snakes controlling drugs and going on rampages and blowing folks heads off? Even claimed the dog was mournful for his bereaved master. He didn't mention how the snake felt   Also said something about robots and guns but didn't have any examples to wow us with. Do you?
5089,sarc,"That seems reasonably likely, happens to a lot of people.   Umm, you're the one questioning whether the environment can cause cancer? The ""Evolutionist scientists"" you despise so much are the ones publishing papers about the environmental causes of cancer.   Cancer isn't ""selected"", people who get cancer often die and have no more children...   Think before you post next time? Or is that too much to ask?"
5090,sarc," and that any consistent pro-life advocate must urge any mother who accidentally loses her child due to actions she undertook  be charged with manslaughter.I wonder  is this actually the case?"" That's a good point. We need to outlaw miscarriage. After all, women knew the risk of miscarriage when they had sex. "
5091,sarc,"That's not evolution, that's abiogenesis.   Human memory? How long do you suppose that is?   Decide? Now you're pulling our legs. The rest of the ape family will never evolve into humans. Btw we are apes.   Simply not true. Your sources are lying to you.   Truer words were never spoken.   Except most people with a scientific background reject the supposed evidence against evolution and for good reason, it doesn't exist."
5092,sarc,"The article as a whole never made that argument either.   Lie number.... oh I can't keep track anymore, let's just call it 40."
5093,sarc,The critical factor here is punishing women.   Women must be punished. For whatever strikes the fancy of Cybererratus.
5094,sarc,"The culprit is menopausal hotflashes from us aging boomers.   More ppl and animals die worldwide from exposure to cold than heat, plus added C02 will be boon for flora."
5095,sarc,The deafening screech of moving goalposts. DC is not the argument here.   YOU claimed the following:   You were wrong. Eat your crow like a good little boy.
5096,sarc,The debate has been settled a long time ago. and also about dragons!
5097,sarc,"The framing of the argument is designed to present crime infliction vs crime prevention in order to elicit a response. One is led to a conclusion based on the limited information presented. As such, firearms use other than the ones presented are indeed relevant, unless you intend your factoid to exist in a vaccuum devoid of analysis.   You might also note that Kitchen knives are more often used for crime than for self defense. Would you believe additional information on kitchen knives would be relevant, or would you have all the information necessary to make a policy decision?"
5098,sarc,"The inanity in defence of guns continues unabated. The poor shooter probably thought, quite innocently, that his fellow countrymen might be about to shoot him with their concealed carries, he shot them first, a perfectly reasonable response."
5099,sarc,"The issue of self-control, Winston Smith?   Pray, does that ever apply to men?   Is there a ghost of a chance that maybe men should keep their trousers zipped and a certain offending member contained therein?   Or are you a proponent of belief in virgin birth, believing that only women are involved in a pregnancy?"
5100,sarc,"The last known passenger pigeon died in 1914. Your attempt to inflame the discussion fails on the grounds of utter stupidity. Might as well be asking if he bagged a tasmanian tiger, or a chupacabra, or the mothman."
5101,sarc,"The only thing ""imposing"" that view is evidence and logical necessity, though it is true Creationists are impervious to either. Y'all can deny reality as much as you like, it still comes back to bite you on the XXX."
5102,sarc,"The only thing he has faced has been kangaroos, the mirror and flying springs from the scale"
5103,sarc,The question in the post was about countries not states the USA. So what does your reply have to do with the topic of this post?   Besides nothing!
5104,sarc,"The same way, for the woman shot at the guy not when she was in the shower but afterwards and what good did it do to her ?   Maybe she was sohhhhhhhhhhh ugly that the poor guy ran away.   Do you have pictures of her, by the way?"
5105,sarc,There are certainly more people who think that species evolve from earlier species than there are than people who think species evolve from later species.

5107,sarc,"This caught my eye. armor-piercing handguns, cop killer handguns. What exactly is an Armor piercing handgun? And who sells those?   Nothing like making up some stuff to make the problem seem worse than it is. Handgun bullets that will defeat a policeman's vest are already illegal! Nothing like throwing in a few lies~!~"
5108,sarc,This is more of a creationist circlejerk than an actual discussion.
5109,sarc,This rates an 8 out of 10 on the hypocracy scale. Weren't you just scolding people both for using false analogies and for citing emotionally laden imagery for political purposes? Tsk tsk.
5110,sarc,"Too hard of a question... Pass.   There'd be no need for an 'Abortion' forum on this board.   His (my) name would be Mickey Jones?   Easy... One of them would be sterile.   Yes, No, and maybe so."
5111,sarc,"Two answers: they were either of the ant kind and didn't eat wood until they underwent hyperevolution after the landing of the ark, or they were placed in a suspended state of hibernation by 'Awlmighty Gawd' (only two - one male and one female, in spite of the fact that termites don't actually propagate that way). It is, after all, the word of Gawd, as revealed in the wholly babble."
5112,sarc,"Um, of course, it was too much to expect murderers to shell out for burying their victims. I keep forgetting I'm in Dick Cheney's America."
5113,sarc,"Very poor argument. Theft is not commensurate with a woman's right tow own her own body. Of course, according to your theft argument, a woman's bodily resources ARE STOLEN from her by a fetus, by a pregnancy. Guess it works after all.   If a woman does not grant a fetus access to her bodily resources, it is theft, pure and simple."
5114,sarc,"Very simple. Among all the information about how genetics and hence evolution work, was the claim that the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology is out-of-date. It's SOP. Take one sentence out of a whole publication that opposes your theory, misinterpret it, and declare victory. Helped by the terminology. Evo dogma dethroned!!! Well, that's the end of it, when the dogma is gone, there is nothing left.   Because he thinks we think like him, where if the Creation myth in Genesis falls, then all of religion and morality fall with it. Or in our case, all of secularism and immorality fall with the CD of MB. Because thinking the way scientists or non-Creationists Christians do is incomprehensible and evil, and what else is there?"
5115,sarc,Wasn't there some genius that wanted firearms locked up as a manditory model posting here? Gee if they can steal from the police station what punishment can we mete out for us unwashed working slobs for not locking up and reporting stolen firearms? Got them into Chicago even with its strict gun laws. Wonder if they complied with the IL gun laws? Yea right.
5116,sarc,"We all agree that abortion is ""killing"". Killing something that has yet to become self aware is different IMO. Funny you request an open ""mind"". My point is that it ain't a human being if it ain't got no mind. That's why they unplug you when you're brain dead."
5117,sarc,"Well it came from somewhere and presumably changed as it went along.   Careful there that ones been clearly shown to be the case - in a laboratory environment to boot. Not to mention in the form of a hydrogen bomb!   You mean that the planets and stars have always existed? Really - so how come we see stars being made in nurseries via the Hubble telescope.   So you don't believe that life had an origin! WOW so you think its always been present on the Earth? Not even the bible goes that far! And you fail to account for the observation that there IS life.   Thats not an evolutionary theory, at least not a scientific one. Kinds is a theological construct not a biological one and MOST creationists use the KINDS thing as a support for their arguments."
5118,sarc,Well speed is homegrown and the profits stay within the US. Then there is the productivity benifits of having a jacked up population that never sleeps and can do manual tedious labor for days on end
5119,sarc,"Well, I am in good company.   See you in hell then before it freezes over.   Gee! the power of the documentary, it caused global cooling. so the pen is mightier than CO2"
5120,sarc,"Well, that's disappointing.   I though the congratulations were for me (17th wedding anniversary yesterday).   Okay, I suppose a woman's right to choose might be as important. Congrats!   Smiley"
5121,sarc,"000 years or so."" Well, ya know, if you actually, oh I don't know, VISITED THE SITE, you'd see that the \friendlyatheist.com\"" is a blog-like page (and not the one that is actually giving the info on the evolutionary migration of humanity) and it gave a link to the actual website that we are talking about (the second link I gave): http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/journey/ But then  maybe we're expecting a little too much from a creationist.Oh  there's no hypocrisy involved  just you being your usual self and not even looking at the actual information (or  more likely  looking at the information and then deliberately playing dumb)."" "
5122,sarc,"Well, you know. I always like to get my scientific information from a ""...non-profit, Christ-centered, non-denominational ministry dedicated to upholding the authority of Scripture from the very first verse!"" Read Nature or Science? Nah! Read journals of evolutionary biology, genetics, microbiology, molecular biology, paleontology? Nah! Or read scientific magazines with articles by leading scientists like Scientific American? Nah! Or read books by leading scientists or respected science writers? Nah! All I need is that ministry that upholds scripture."
5123,sarc,"What about them? Is this a question?   Um. Have you read Leveticus? And I mean, read it. Not skimmed it.   Because, God loves everybody. Are you reaching?   And what does fast and loose mean? I'm confused. I think you are trying to label me.. but I'm not quite sure what I'm being labled as.   What part about people burning in hell for eternity?"
5124,sarc,"What if they do pass the federal amendment would then still agree with them then? If we are locked out permanently, which the christianist seek to do, then why not? The gay personals are filled with married men wanting discret meetings."
5125,sarc,"What is incredible is that this is probably the most enlightened response I can expect from this crowd.   I know that schmuck, that's the point. The Egyptians were trying to preserve the bodies and under the best of circumstances look how they deteriorate. Now ask yourself this genius, how long does it take for a bone to fossilize? And does a fossilized bone become immune to the elements and deterioration over millions of years when even steel corrodes from the alkali in the earth?"
5126,sarc,"What is the reasoning behind one gun a month? So that way you can't fully arm a monkey all in one day (a gun in each hand, a gun in each foot, and a gun on the tail)!"
5127,sarc,"Where is the evidence for an American-style ""culture of fear"" in India? An op-ed from a Detroit-based member of a rightwing thinktank shouting that they need guns, just doesn't cut it."
5128,sarc,"Where's the smileys? This is a joke, right?   My sons have owned their own guns since they were 11 years old. Of course I bought them, but I bought their shoes, too.   Maybe my mind ain't right on this one."
5129,sarc,"While we're on the subject, I've managed to conclusively disprove Intelligent (sic) Design. It's actually a remarkably simple thing to do when you realise that Nature is just far too complex to have been designed.   Look around you. We humans are perhaps the best designers that we know of. Look how crude are the things we make: the filthy, inefficient combustion engine; the computer, unable to make decisions of its own and unable to feel emotions; the microwave, unable to cool anything like a tasty meal. We are, at best, crude emulators of Nature.   No. No designer could possibly have kept track of all the interlocking wonders of the natural world, therefore there can't possibly have been one.   Also, the chances of a designer appearing ab initio in the Universe are of the order 1 in 5x10^90871. I worked it out.   I'll let the Discovery Institute know."
5130,sarc,"Who knows? Maybe the dudes went to the shooting range close by LAX and didn't go home. The fact is they made up some bogus bullcrap to prosecute when there was nothing illegal. What probable cause was there? None. I had buddy of mine arrested because he was posing with legally held firearms that someone at his college ""ratted"" him out on him having ""illegal"" ones. There was nothing illegal but he was a. thrown in jail. b. spent thousands in lawyer fees c. never got his guns back. c. had to leave his position as student body president...and the police? ""We are sorry about that. Oh well."" You see what I mean? Gotta love LAPD."
5131,sarc,"Why would anyone want to get to Heaven? Archangel and people like him would be there, praying and chanting 24/7 . Thanks but no thanks!"
5132,sarc,"With all of the drunks running around, you'd think everyone would know how to treat someone for alcohol poisoning or being run over by a car, wouldn't you.   Sometimes I'm certain that your elevator has never seen the penthouse."
5133,sarc,"Wonderful... As soon as the Christians get in, it'll be ""morals for everyone."" They don't seem to realize that their morals don't necessarily apply to everyone."
5134,sarc,"Wooh!   A bunch of shot up bodies are drivel.   Nice, really nice, Sarge!"
5135,sarc,Worse yet what if the sperm has penetrated the egg and fertilization will clearly take place in short order but one stops the process before the genomes are integrated?????????
5136,sarc,"Wow BIOLOGISTS have been working on strteches of DNA of previously unknown function and found what they went looking for - function. That sure knocks genetics and evolution off its feet. Yep no question about it at all. Darwin will be trashed when junk DNA is explained, all his predictions about junk DNA being functionless will be falsified. Oh, oh wait a second. Darwins theory and the NDS make zero predictions about ""junk"" DNA! Guess that if one has nothing to falsify then falsification is pretty unlikely."
5137,sarc,"Wow! sorry for making a little light on a touchy subject. ""we are all monkeys"" was meant to be a joke and I am a catholic, because I was baptized catholic, but I don't have to believe that Jesus saved anyone because I don't know if he did and I don't really care. All I care about is today and tomorrow and relax, you can't go around freaking out all the time. And someone, who ever said we don't have tails, well here is an evolution tid-bit for you, elephants don't have thick course hair anymore either... is that called??? evolution? I think we did have some sort of stubby tail at one point and that's where I think we got our ""Tail-bone"" from. I am just kidding, but relax. Anyone who gets all huffy-puffy about what I think... well, then you are a monkey.   Nikki"
5138,sarc,"Wow, a thread that treats me like a XXXXX by spewing absurd propaganda at me, that's compelling and wins my sympathies. Well done old chap."
5139,sarc,"Wow, what a great argument! We can use the same ""logic"" for rabbits: take their current population and doubling rate and ""prove"" they didn't even exist 100 years ago!   I love those ""common sense"" arguments."
5140,sarc,"Wow.   Who knew the entire theory of evolution could be destroyed in a 2 page comic book?   I guess when dealing with Creationist and half truths, the KISS motto is best.   Waxy"
5141,sarc," I think the court decision in Nunn vs. State of Georgia did the best summation of this right!"" Yeah, all liberals love overturned court cases that never saw the light through the appeals process. I think Ohio and it's Constitution finally prevailed and now they carry open or concealed.You wasn't on that Cessna were you? "
5142,sarc,"Yeah, it is really difficult to cut and paste a news article onto the forum. Look at the gun page, he is nothing more than a bot."
5143,sarc,"Yeah, reasonable people are OK with ripping unborn fetuses from their mother's wombs minutes before the baby would be born naturally! How dare those kooks try to defend the rights of the unborn fetus!"
5144,sarc,"Yeah, that's probably what Stalin and Hitler said at first too. They were also big fans of 'gun-control'. 'Gun-control' works great.. especially in countries with fewer freedoms and/or socialist governments. I read somewhere that in Japan that the police can (and do) visit you twice a year at your home unannounced to question you about your activities. And yet, people still die at the hands of criminals there like anywhere else.   Sorry, you assume that because the 'law-abiding' abide by these laws that that will somehow affect the actions of those that disobey the laws. Doesn't work that way. You liberals are always quick to blame inanimate objects for the actions of the irresponsible. But then, liberalism is all about excusing the behavior of the irresponsible."
5145,sarc,"Yeah. Funny thing about that.   NONE of what you quoted includes any discussion of money raised...   They organized marches. Yes.   They had phone banks for the purpose of persuading undecided voters. Yes.   But no mention of money raised...   And don't get me wrong. I am against the organizing of marches and the phone banks.   But if we're going to start indicting on that as well, please let me know cause the list of ""guilty churches"" just got a heck of a lot longer as opposed to just listing ones which had generated ""$190,000"" directly, and lots more from individual church members."
5146,sarc,Yes but of course was that rreally a consious choice? I see sarcasm but no real answer that is credible.......seesh if I wanted srcasm I would have watched the Orielly factor. (oh wait thats yelling and bicering) knida like politics! (oops sarcasm hehe)
5147,sarc,"Yes that would solve the problem wouldn't it,worked the first time around,I say that because we (U.S.)are compared to the wild west.   But be they whites,Blacks,Reds,or pi** purple shoot a few that try to detain or threaten you, yeah I think they will back off unless they are prepared to go to war."
5148,sarc,"Yes they did: ""...it ate itself.""   No wonder they're extinct..."
5149,sarc,"Yes, because atheists love it when New Orleans gets drowned in water and thousands die. Hell, I know I'm throwing a party tonight, going to get my atheist friends over, and my pagan brothers to. Maybe a couple of beers, some dogs on the grill, all topped off with us ******* on a crucifex.   Grow up."
5150,sarc,"Yes, but if true it would certainly make the investigation go easier and the repair of other bridges faster and cheaper. Ban gay marriage - your bridges never collapse - imagine that!"
5151,sarc,"Yes, he threw the ID camp a bone.   Tell us, Monty - what have the ID 'scientists' been doing to look for design?   I mean besides reading other people's research and proclaiming ""See! Design!""?"
5152,sarc,"Yes, it's a common problem that nutjob parody posts can be hard to distinguish from sincere nutjobs posts. This is an artifact of how utterly ridiculous the nutjob position is."
5153,sarc,"Yes, it's been supressed. Only 14 people knew it before some brave soul tortured them until they confessed the horrible truth!!"
5154,sarc,"Yes, that was one of Galileo's more absurd leaps of logic."
5155,sarc,"Yes, well thats usually the way it works. Kinda hard to enslave everybody when they are packing heat."
5156,sarc,"Yes, you also have to admire his philosophy on this: go against my opinion and physical harm will befall you.   Who needs reason when you can threaten your opponents with death?"
5157,sarc,You betcha. Even JP who usually can defend such stuff has failed. VOR doesn't even bother (not surpisingly consider it requires brain usage)   The mere fact they let him do that is damning aganist the Vatican.
5158,sarc,"You can't create an artificial minority, wave a magic wand and declare that they should be granted a special status. That not how it should works."
5159,sarc,"You crack me up.   That was a nice rant that had absolutely nothing to do with anything. The essential question is not what various religous leaders have said about the issue, but what the Bible says about the issue."
5160,sarc,"You ever get the impression that WW isn't actually a person, but one of those bots that is designed to participate in conversation in ways vaguely resembling one, but lacking the essential characteristics of diversity of response and the ability to follow an argument?"
5161,sarc,You forgot to mention that we would have to change our numbering system so that grasshoppers had 4 legs.
5162,sarc,"You guys are going WAY overboard on this. The changes to the board of education standards will NOT materially change the way evolution is taught in Kansas, nor does it allow the teaching of creationism or intelligent design in our classrooms.   Our districts scientific advisory board says the changes to the curriculum make it ""more factually accurate"", and even the folks who drafted the original curriculum could find no factual fault with the new draft.   The chicken littles out there need to get a grip."
5163,sarc,You haven't got a point. You're so far from having a point that you make completely blunt things look dangerously pointy.   People who believe the Genesis account of creation are barkingly delusional and nobody else has any duty to humour them in any way with the possible exception of preventing them from harming themselves on pointy things.
5164,sarc,You know what I find amusing here...your entire argument revolves around how it will affect your wallet. Forget about the lives of the people who are denied rights in this country that you take forgranted. That is the true christian-American spirit isn't it? Oh how proud our forefathers would be if they could see us now...oh wait...most of them owned people...nevermind.
5165,sarc,"You know, you and Saddam may have more in common than you might have thought.   But really, I think they may be on to something with Sharia Law. If you steal, they cut off your hand. Pretty good deterent. If you do drugs they execute you. If you commit adultery they stone you to death. But Saddam thought that Sharia law was too harsh to be used in general practice."
5166,sarc,"You mean I can get pregnant all by myself! COOL! Out with the men. They have been ticking me off for YEARS!   Well, where should we draw the line with men? At what point is it OK for the government to take control rather than letting men make choices for their bodies?   For me. Nothing less than I ALWAYS MAKE MY OWN CHOICES FOR MY BODY is acceptable and anything else is violation."

Man, it doesn't take an addicted researcher kept up two weeks by a thousand cups of coffee to know that Michael Moore is one of the most left-wing, anti-gun, troop-bashing producers in Hollywood. And what does that fat ignoramus have? He's ignorant. All he has is an opinion, just like you and I do. The fact that he is a celebrity does not make him any more knowledgeable than anyone else, especially when you consider that he thinks that he's the divine prophet of the universe, and that everything will be fine and dandy if you do what he says we should do."

5179,sarc,"Yup. Give me an example of a true inaccuracy, instead of working to poke fun. Do you honestly think anyone will take you seriously (except the evolutionists) if you don't provide reasons for your apparent problem with scriptures. Are you scared because you see the ""ancients"" commenting on subjects you thought science had ""discovered"" since the ""enlightenment""? Man, how arrogant can you get?

5187,sarc,holy ####.   It took 20 pages before a creationist tried to address the first post.   So much for a argument disproving the flood...
5188,sarc,"if someone chopped off your best friends head right in front of you, would they be deserving of the death penalty?"
5189,sarc,"lol.  great point pickle.Honestly, why not put into play the madman breaking into your house with not a care of your life or (im putting in a small child and puppy!) your small child or your little puppy. Because the time you take your sorry little self to the cops, he will be you and your little child."
5190,sarc,"no no! through the power of god, the animals all came themselves, and lined up ready for the ride, haven't you seen the movie?!?"
5191,sarc,person ( P ) Pronunciation Key (prsn)   n.   A living human.   human ( P ) Pronunciation Key (hymn)   n.   A member of the genus Homo and especially of the species H. sapiens   You mean these definitions?...Just wondering
5192,sarc,"put it on pay-per view, call it a new extream sport."
5193,sarc,that was a cheap shot my friend.. lets keep at around an a*d*u*l*t level.. shall we?
5194,sarc,"the gun haters have lost the battle, it's time for you and your fellow sheeple to leave the country and head for territory where you belong, like France.   Go on, beat it! Get out of here before you scream and terror and die of a heart attack at the sight of two children playing cops and robbers and saying ""Bang! Bang! You're dead!"""
5195,sarc,the problem is that the scientists don?t rule the world but the fundamentalists do and since Global Warming does not appear in the Bible it can not be true. Right?   By the way when the day comes that the fruity nutters are proved wrong it will be too late. And the fruity nutters will say: ?It was God?s will ?   We are doomed as the fundamentalist ?capitalist axis in the USA will screw the world for good sooner or later.
5196,sarc,there is the problem the lack of civilized societies are well.. when you find one come tell me.
5197,sarc,"they are never wrong when they can keep AK 47's and full auto Usi""s out of the hande of 1st graders, oh, wate, the law they want to renew is only for what it looks like. it must be to stop all those drive by bayanetings.   nothing that might limit what a ""gun-nut"" can buy is wrong to the gun-grabber."
5198,sarc,"what does the big bang have to do with evolution?   Oh yes I know, NOTHING   Once again peddler shows he has virtually no understanding of evolution."
5199,sarc,you seem to know a lot about something that exists only in your imagination.   archangel knows also everything about dragons.   when does the soul takes abode in a human being according to you?   can we detect this happenning? any pictures of souls?
5200,sarc,"well duh. Everyone w/ a brain can figure that out.   I'm waiting for either Marc or Supersport to post here. I doubt it though. Heaven forbid actually discussing things without their willful ignorance.   Or more amusing they'd admit they consider all non-literalist, fundemental jews, chritians and muslims along with every other religion to be atheists. But I don't think they are that stupid."
5201,sarc,"DOH! yah beat me to it!   I'll elaborate with the Zardoz answer:   Stupid people want other stupid people to believe in their stupid belief systems and when they find non-stupid people, they have a coniption fits because they're too stupid to understand that their beliefs are stupid.   Simple version:   Stupid is as Stupid does   Come be stupid with us."
5202,sarc,It's fascinting to me how much faith atheists have in randomness
5203,sarc,"This thread is patently ridiculous.   What is your point, Oliphant? That all offensive behaviour is also immoral? That insulting people is immoral? That all immoral behaviour should be prohibited? That all people who find something immoral should take measures to prevent that thing from happening? Where are you going with this?"
5204,sarc,"Oh, is this an abortion trap? I thought it was really about the death penalty....."
5205,sarc,"Yes, that is logical   So you're saying your unwilling to discuss it, and you think that an oblique ad hominem (fitting in with nut cases) is a way to progress this topic?   No, you got the reason right. Why not actually discuss it? Or is it in effect to say ""I'm making a post to say I've got nothing to add to this thread""?"
5206,sarc,And so you have it... Socialist lunatic fringe view that human lives are only worth what the government says its worth....
5207,sarc,"Just because Dolphins start using tools doesn't mean that one will give birth to a chipmunk!   Get real, evolution is a fairytale!!"
5208,sarc,"You don't mean Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, do you? The Russian spies? Nah, you said wrongfully accused....."
5209,sarc,Oh? What keeps you from having 6 or eight or for that matter having crossed bandoleers across the chest?   I suspect kalifornia law will be changed a bunch and one in the pipe will be in vogue as well as a loaded mag in the gun for utility sake. You wouldn't want the perp to be disadvantaged too much now would you? How many shots must one allow the perp before you can fire back?
5210,sarc,"Oh, and please name a terrorist that purchased a weapon from a gun show, and then used it in a crime."
5211,sarc,"Don't get me wrong. This isn't exactly a trip to Sunday school. You shouldn't accept packing an arsenal around in the trunk as if it were completely innocuous. It kinda seems suspicious like a primer colored Nissan Maxima with five guys wearing stocking caps sitting in a vacant lot at 3 a.m......   ...something's not right, but nothing is illegal.   The guy should have been asked to leave airport property.   Officer #1: ""HOLY COW! GUNS! Arrest him!""   Officer #2: ""On, what?""   Officer #1: ""Uh......Felony something! Uh......Felony transportation of guns! No. Not evil sounding enough. Uh.........Felony transportation of AN ASSAULT RIFLE! Yeah! I've included the term ""assault rifle"" so it must be illegal!""   Officer #2: ""What about those guys over there in that Nissan Maxima?""   Officer #1: ""Oh, they look suspicious. We'll check them for legally carried firearms next. If we don't find any, I guess we'll have to let them go."""
5212,sarc,Really? Can you link to a creationist website that does not connect evolution to people doing bad things?
5213,sarc,"You need to visit some other websites; i.e. get yourself out and around in the real internet world some more.   Shake the cobwebs off your bold.   There are, for example, presently thousands of posts at the New York Times, in only the last day or two, from single payer and public option supporters.   Go scream your bold there Big Shot. You and your other handles that comprise this entire forum of one man who probably also needs to see a doctor for a strong psychiatric prescription."
5214,sarc,"So the tooth that gave rise to Nebraska Man was evidence - evidence of what - a tooth.   But from that piece of evidence evolutionaries were able to extrapolate a whole new race of men!   So, is it still ?evidence??   So much for evidence pointing to evolution ? it is what you make of the ?evidence?."
5215,sarc,"Fred Phelps has joined the forum!   Edo, it is abundantly clear how concerned you are about your credibility, when considering your addition of this statement to your previously rather notable track record."
5216,sarc,Well if you are Catholic you would should probably find him pretty credible.
5217,sarc,"A seminar by the deity? With slides showing each step? I'm sure it would be quite popular.   Look, the reason science assumes the operation of natural law is because it has to. If it assumed the deity interfered with everything at her whim, the entire scientific project would be impossible.   Why do you keep asking science to act like a religion?"
5218,notsarc,"Oh, probably about as many as there are killed by bayonet lugs, pistol grips, heat shields, detachable magazines, and folding stocks."
5219,notsarc,So as a gay man I should be forced to accept hetero marriage. If I am forced to accept hetero marriage they should be forced to accept gay marriage. What part of equal protection do you not understand? I personally would like to see all displays of all religions wiped fron the public square. No one is going to dictate to me how to live my life based upon some outdated religious belief that I don't subscribe too.
5220,notsarc,So what else is new? Does Texas support the death penalty?
5221,notsarc,Do you actually have any idea how science works? Why are you not embarrassed for creationism?
5222,notsarc,"Oh I certainly don't pretend that and certainly didn't claim that either--though a couple of left-wing posters here (who will remain nameless for now) might take the bizarre step of saying my post to you amounted to as much, if history is any indicator. Maybe we'll all luck out and they'll forget their Lenses of Bias at home, and instead read claims people actually make."
5223,notsarc,"you've got to be kidding me. This has got to be one of the absolute dumbest things I have heard. You are truly one confused individual if you can't tell there's a distinct difference between a living thing and a nonliving thing -- that non-living things are missing something that living things have.... Just because this difference cannot be analyzed, measured or defined does not mean it's not there. You can't analyze or define your thought patterns, dreams, brainwaves or consciousness either -- but that does not mean they aren't there. I think you've lost it -- You may very well belong in a mental facility."
5224,notsarc,And the comments section is usually where the real comedy lies.
5225,notsarc,Yep. They're free to marry a member of the opposite sex just like any other American.
5226,notsarc,"Well... someone hasn't been following the campaigns for the so-called ""protection of marriage"" amendments, federal or state."
5227,notsarc,"YES, of course, they could not actually hunt, since that would be illegal, possibly a felony, whihc could lead to forfeiture of your rights."
5228,notsarc,"Really? Let me see. Two creation myths and a global flood myth where 5 million ""kinds"" of animal were crammed into a big box that magically floats for a year - yeah, that's secular history."
5229,notsarc,So we don't? I thought we had the capacity to destroy it. That seems within the range of control eh?
5230,notsarc,"I see. Does the fact that these so-called ""exposures"" are constantly and correctly destroyed by those with Logic not phase you?"
5231,notsarc,"You have done a marvelous job knocking down strawmen of your own construction. Having offered a naive and superficial caricature of atheism, agnosticism, and theism, you then imagine a self-serving hierarchy that is, in a word, worthless - all in a silly effort to show yourself most humble. Ironic."
5232,notsarc,And the loss to society because people used guns instead of an alternate weapon is?
5233,notsarc,"Wait, did you really ask a question imply an answer and then condemn someone for it? Haha, your logic may be more delusional than I thought."
5234,notsarc,"Actually, that's what they call most of the people that come in to contact with me."
5235,notsarc,Actually the bible is silent concerning abortion which is odd considering it was highly outlawed by surrounding nations.The bible is very clear concerning the value of a fetus as opposed to an actual soulish being(mother) though.
5236,notsarc,"Well, this comes from the same people who invented the death pannels. The truth is that all the developed countries (all of Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Israel) have universal healthcare. Their COST per capita is about half of ours. They have better outcomes.Universal healthcare has been tried in many places and it does work. What does not work is our current system. Wellpoint has just increased premiums by 30% even wiyhout a reform bill. They spend 30% on administrative costs.BTW, do you oppose the bill that would force them to limit the administrative costs to 20%?"
5237,notsarc,"And some of us are so hung up on stereotyping, emotionally charged rhetoric that they will never be able to accomplish one thing to address the abortion issue."
5238,notsarc,evidently not. You have been unable to present me with any scientific evidence that mutations can create the raw material for which natural selection (which also doesn't exist) would act.This renders your theory scientifically worthless and more along the lines of astrology or palm reading.
5239,notsarc,"Archie, the ONLY issue that gays don't have a majority support for gay equality on is gay marriage. That's it.Laws against sodomy? Majority oppose them.Laws against gay adoption? Majority oppose them.Laws against gays in the military? Majority oppose them.Hate crime legislation for gays? Majority supports them.ENDA? Majority support.Even CIVIL UNIONS has a majority support.But you are too swept up in your self-assumed superiority to recognize when you are standing alone...I am laughing at the fact that you are fighting against people who comment on SOME Christian actions against gays, but then you EXUDE the very thing we are talking about.You become a living example.Quite frankly Archie, I think you are a thorough embarrassment to most of the other anti-gay posters on these threads.Comparing gays to al Qaeda? emoticonXDonno And I thought Robertson and Falwell were emoticonXCensored when they tried to associate gays as a cause to the issue of 9/11."
5240,notsarc,"I know this would be somewhat of a drain on your time but I think it would be helpful if you would make a short post at the end of each post stating how much time the next poster has, what post number this is, how many are left, any comments concerning going outside the rules, etc."
5241,notsarc,"Really? Why can't you ""disprove"" what it actually is instead of someone's explanation of it? It's a standard scientific tool, the procedure is well documented. If you can ""prove"" that it's wrong somehow you should be able to do it right off the bat, you shouldn't need to be primed with someone's explanation."
5242,notsarc,"And I'm addressing your counter-arguments in that regard. One of those counter arguments has been that both chimps and ourselves had four billion years to evolve to our level of intelligence and that during all that time we were subject to the same ecological pressures. Neither of those statements is accurate. The first is misleading for the reasons outlined above, and the second is simply false: humans have experienced greatly different ecological challenges since we diverged from chimps.I'll finish up tomorrow - battery dead."
5243,notsarc,"Well, it seems pretty evident that you have know idea of the meaning of the word theory when used in science."
5244,notsarc,"The Polar Icecaps have been melting for the past 14,000 years according to experts. Many in the scientific community believe that it would be another 100-1000 years before the melting of Polar Ice becomes a factor in the rise of sea level. What they believe is more important is the thermal expansion of the world's water that comes with the increase in the oceans' mean temperature.Some predict that the rise in sea level could be 3' by 2100, so don't invest long-term in any beach-front property that isn't on tall stilts and you'll be OK. emoticonXGood"
5245,notsarc,"So why is it a white man can't just think himself black, or vice versa?"
5246,notsarc,If humans are parasites can I kill you because parasites have no worth. 
5247,notsarc,"Pregnancy isn't expensive at all unless you're conned into thinking it has to be. If it were, poor people couldn't have the kids they do. Medical costs can be paid for by others. It's the luxuries many yuppy types seem to think they need that makes the after effects costly. In most cases of putting a pregnancy up for adoption, there is NO cost incurred to the mother."
5248,notsarc,Not heard that before! made me laugh almost as much as your lettuce eating Tyrannosaur emoticonXGood
5249,notsarc,"Being new isn't a problem. Nor is uncertainty about a position. The way to learn is to ask questions in appropriate places. However, a problem with message boards is that, without experience, it may be difficult to tell who is speaking from knowledge and who is speaking from ignorance or faith."
5250,notsarc,"Well, their cash cow dried up and even Toby Hoover is going to have to get a new gig. No matter how many times these dire warnings were given they just never came to pass and over 2/3rds of the people are wise to them now and they have lost any credibility at all. Folks all over are now standing up demanding their rights and the left has expended both it's money and political and emotional capital. Stick a fork in them Lucy, they are done emoticonXHoho"
5251,notsarc,"So parthenegenic births are always female. Where did the X chromosome come from? Is this another case of ""POOF, it was a miracle"" when faced with reality?"
5252,notsarc,"See Above.I can't help but notice your signature. What are you, Patriot under a different username? Bad show, Patriot. Sock Puppets aren't good debate form.Patriot-- About your statement that you've been vindicated. I hope you're just fooling around. :)TruthSeeker's first post doesn't even belong in a debate forum. She stated an opinion, and then stated absolutely nothing to back it up in any way. No evidence. No reasoning. Not one ""because"". Nothing. It was like entering a presidential candidate debate and saying, ""I think the other guy sucks"" and leaving. Hence why I asked her as politely as possible to elaborate."
5253,notsarc,And yet there are plenty of websites written by scientists with the details:
5254,notsarc,"How do you know he was a gun owner? Maybe he borrowed it. ;)And I bet he was a carnivore, walked upright and drove a car, as well."
5255,notsarc,"He was barred for presenting hard evidence against the Big Bang. Observable evidence. He was the head astronomer at Mt Carmel not just another astronomer. He was our best one.Being barred from the telescopes he was in charge of , being fired , and having to move to Germany is not what you consider suppression? I am not willing to discuss this with you anymore if you refuse to do it honestly. You can say anything."
5256,notsarc,it can't always be cared by anyone. What if no one wants the baby or you can't get to a place where you can give the baby up (maybe snowed in for a week). Can you kill the baby then because it is now dependent on you.
5257,notsarc,"Well you can get injured very badly playing baseball, you can get killed (just the other day some high school coach took a batting practice ball right in the head and died). And I have not heard a single person say that pregnancy is something no one should have to go through. I know I don't. And yes people sometimes do force a woman to get pregnant, it's called rape."
5258,notsarc,"This says absolutely nothing about gays.It talks about Congress investigating Science and Ethics.Quite frankly, I think some of the people they NEED to be investigating is NARTH, as I just proved that their article MISQUOTED other research articles.Furthermore, I can supply you with a long list of other anti-gay researchers who likewise have been guilty of misrepresenting other people's research.On a separate note, this article was further down on that web-page. It had this title: ""Federal Judge Dismisses Scientific Misconduct Claim """
5259,notsarc,"Oh no, I completely hit the point and exposed it for what it is. Your continuing to compare the ID concept to a flat earth belief proves my point even more. That and the fact that you referred to the flying spaghetti monster seven times in your last post."
5260,notsarc,"And yet this is what they fossil record shows. There is alot of information floating around on the uses of feathers for insulation, hunting techniques, display etc before flight.Half a feather might not be as good for flight as a ""fully developed"" one, but dinosaurs had them and they probably were able to glide, albeit poorly, with them. Even less of a feather might shade a pool of water to allow them to spot small fish or for display to attract a potential mate. To say they were ""totally useless"", is simply false. Evolution works on adapting already functional structures for different functions."
5261,notsarc,"and tell me what did you gain out of making this statement? Just to let you know... the Bible (if you would actually read it in context instead of reading a little portion that you want to and interpret it the way you want outside of its context).. teaches how to love... because God is love.. and laid down his own life so that we could be FREE! hmmm.... sounds like the motto of what our troops do for our country... they lay their lives down because they want us to be free... where do you think this ""ideology"" comes from???"
5262,notsarc,"**Sorry to hear you say this. I have never attacked you personally, never said anything like what you accuse me of saying. I have characterized certain ideas, notions, and opinions as stupid and simple-minded, but not you personally. If your personal identity causes you to believe that an attack on those ideas is an attack on you personally, than obviously what I've been saying about your personal commitent and emotional involvement with materialist/mechanist/darwinist/atheism is spot on the money."
5263,notsarc,I'm not against concealed carry in principle but open carry seems silly to me. I smell posers.
5264,notsarc,"Just out of curiosity, what do you feel you could sue the company for? Descrimination? Could I sue Wal Mart or Dillons for not carrying a line of adult movies and sex toys? After all, I have a right to own adult movies and sex toys. Doesn't that mean that Wal Mart automatically has the responsibillity to provide those goods? After all, they are the biggest retailer in my area."
5265,notsarc,I've always gone the Scylla and Charybdis route before instead.
5266,notsarc,"AGREED!!!!That has to be BY FAR the best series I've ever read!Also, Asimov's Foundation triligoy is good. And again, the classics:Fahrenheit 4511984Catcher in the Rye...and all those other depressing books..."
5267,notsarc,"Because we view it as something much more than just a gravy train from the govt., that's why.For you it seems to be about the word, and the govt. saying ""oh, you use THAT term (""marriage""), ok we recognize it."" For us it's about the commitment."
5268,notsarc,Does any part of the theory of evolution give an accounting of how we transitioned from quadruped movements of the ape to biped? 
5269,notsarc,So you think that people that express a different point of view than you are doing something illegal? You must disagree with freedom of speech. You're a scary guy.
5270,notsarc,"Well, if they are already pointing a gun at me, I wouldn't have a chance to pull out a gun and shoot them. They would shoot me before I did that. "
5271,notsarc,"He has been published. Not on the Big Bang -that is not going to happen in America .You are either getting your information from propogandist or making it up yourself. he was a fellow at Los Alamos and Oakridge for more than a decade.Only an idiot would consider him a crackpot he is a brilliant scientist. He is presently involved in a lawsuit for being excluded form a scientific forum for posting his objections to the Big Bang.To you everyone who is not an atheist is a crackpot. According to you 96% of Americans are crackpots.Your comparing Gentry to fireworks man shows your bias , your inability to think for yourself or your total lack of integrity."
5272,notsarc,"You do realize that the rules are supposed to be absurd, to point up the absurdity of a recent court ruling, right?"
5273,notsarc,"Their ""ultimate reality"" is that some higher authority may exist. It's still an ""ultimate reality"" to them. Definitely a religion."
5274,notsarc,"Yes, it does infer that doesnt it, but as I said earlier you have to read it thoroughly in order to see that there is a physical and spiritual make-up to all human beings."
5275,notsarc,"How is that a affect of deterrence? Deterrence works by preventing people through the fear of consequences. A dead man has no fears. Furman Vs. Georgia, where the supreme court specifically noted that there is not a single piece of conclusive evidence that the penalty is a effective deterrent."
5276,notsarc,"And right at the top of the list, at a whopping 31.2 per 100,000, is Washington DC, even though they had a complete and total gun ban in place. How the hell do you explain that? Nobody could own handguns, nobody could ever carry a gun, nobody could have a gun outside of their home, nobody could even load their private guns, so how do they get to be at the top of the list or death rates?"
5277,notsarc,"Just this morning there was an article in the paper about a woman in the Extreme Southern part of Texas in Brownsville being shot ""with a stray bullet from Mexican soldiers"" on our side of the river. Over 80% of the crimes are committed by Mexican gang members, many of which are ex-soldiers and drug enforcement for the mafias.Nope, not safe at all when foreign invaders attack Texans on our side of the river and do pseudo cop break and enters of homes or robbery of businesses.That is a good example of the importance of being armed. One county sheriff along the river encouraged citizens to get armed just for that purpose, freely admitting that his officers will not be there when they are needed the most. We Texans have kidnapping and ransome too but reserve our right to protect ourselves unlike EuroAsia who has copitulated entirely.You were saying?"
5278,notsarc,"What a condescending attitude you have. In case you haven't noticed, you are a very small part of the human race that you smuggly hold in contempt. (Thankfully small!) Your mission should be to improve it, not to stand back and claim you are better than everybody else, as you seem to do.Killing innocent people of any age is wrong. Children are no exception, they are just the epitomy of innocence.The ""pretty sick"" applies to your own deluded thoughts.Rest assured, I will not mourn your death or the deaths of any of those you may have taught your insane values. You are emoticonXCensored !"
5279,notsarc,"So you've gone from evolution and ID to cosmology. You have a real problem with maintaining established realms. ID addresses evolutionary theory, not abiogenesis, and not cosmology."
5280,notsarc,"Actually the idea (intelligent modification of a developing organism by that organism during its development) is as INCOHERENT with or without the introduction of GOD. Its an immaterialist concept invoking elan vital or its equiavlent which these days is sometimes designated as ""intelligence"" so as to put the old and spoiled wine of vitalism into new bottles with the hopes that the new label will allow the proponents to sell it to the public."
5281,notsarc,And it is much easier to have an abortion than to be a mother.
5282,notsarc,And the wonders all around us show us how. . .
5283,notsarc,"Ok. So Lott is flakey. Then Bellesiles is OK? Riiiiight. I though a person's reputation stood on thier own behavior and achivements, not based on someone else. Besides the debate weather Lott is dishonest or not is debatable and still going on. The debate weather Bellesiles is dishonest is over, he is most definately a liar, and this was decided by his boss and the Banqcroft prize commitee."
5284,notsarc,"While that definition of sin is true, the Hebrew definition means missing the mark. You could stretch it to mean unfit in English.And you're technically wrong about the bible. Modernly it is one book, but bible means little books. For a time they were floating around in clusters. So academically they are self contained and unrelated. The apocryphal books are ""secret"" books. Religious scholars eventually decided they were just a bunch of stories, and most never made it in the bible. Look at Song of Solomon it made the cut, and people still have problems with it being put in, yet it conflicts with nothing."
5285,notsarc,I would be interested to see where I made such a claim. Prove your assertion.
5286,notsarc,So will you be comparing gays to child molesters and priests in your same examples? Or blacks with slinging drugs and hoochie mammas? Or will you note the eerie similarities betweenn the wording of some of our gun laws to the Nazi gun laws? 
5287,notsarc,"Thanks: your contributions to this thread throw more light on the subject thananybody else's. However, not sure that believers in any religion in whichsupernatural agencies are worshipped would be happy with the inclusion of""God"" among the set of human beings - unless Jesus Christ was both a man and God which I think is a Christian doctrine.I suppose I started out reading this particular thread expecting to discovera non-circular logical argument that would ""prove"" the existence of a God -and found nothing of the kind. I now think my questions on the matter have been rather stupid and naive."
5288,notsarc,"Then you don't actually have a definition of information that is meaningful. I didn't think you did. By the way, increase in the amount (i.e., more letters) of DNA has often been observed. The mechanisms of evolution account for it quite nicely.Now please try again an define information in a way that is meaningful to DNA."
5289,notsarc,"Well then this doesn't answer my question.If you have 10 doctors for 100 people (this is just an example) and only 50 of them have health insurance and each doctor gets paid $100 a year then your health care per capita is $10 ([10doctors x $100]/100 people). If you change it to 100 people with health insurance you now have $10 per capita as well because you population did not change. Health care costs are shown per capita and not per person insured: Per Capita Health Expenditures by Country, 2007 &mdash; Infoplease.comSo again, if you go from $6,000 per capita per that website given above to say Switzerland levels at $4,100 per capita then where did that money come from?"
5290,notsarc,"Semantics. God has mandated against homosexuality. My point is, people are prepared to admit that the creation story, and the story of noahs arc are metaphors. They read them, and then look at the evidence to hand and say ""Well, it can't be really true the way it is written, so it must mean this...""But the bias of the church against homosexuality is based of a small passage of text which, it seems, cannot be interpreted away. That part that condemns homosexuality is accurate, straight-from-gods-mouth truth. Again, why the dichotomy? Why are some parts of the bible open to interpretation, but others are rigid?"
5291,notsarc,"You've asked a good question cash, the way you know that is by all of the excuses you're getting rather than any attempts to actually answer you directly with solid evidence. Of course we know that evidence doesn't exist, but they'll never admit that either. emoticonXGood"

5295,notsarc,"I'll have you know that the abortion went without a hitch, and my uterus is perfectly healthy, thankyouverymuch (not that it is any of your emoticonXCensored business), and yes, I do plan to have a child in the future, and don't really care what you think about it."
5296,notsarc,"They say: don't say this incorrect statement, say this other one instead!Wow, the ""information"" thing will never cease to kill me."
5297,notsarc,It also allows SCOTUS to strike down State laws that violate constitutional rights ;)
5298,notsarc,"No it means that the genome operates in a more complex way than was previously believed. It does not mean that ""life is irreducibly complex"" since that term is not even sufficiently well defined to test the assertion. And given the scattering of information into many pieces I would say that more and more it looks like ""pieces that happen to be fitted together"". More and more like a complex kludge. Exactly what one might expect to find in an evolved system rather than a designed or deliberate or intentional one!"

5300,notsarc,"Um. Have you read Leveticus? And I mean, read it. Not skimmed it.Because, God loves everybody. Are you reaching?And what does fast and loose mean? I'm confused. I think you are trying to label me.. but I'm not quite sure what I'm being labled as. "
5301,notsarc,Because the judges President Bush nominates are strict constructionist.They interpret the law not make it...........That is the worse nightmare for a liberal or a gay who depend on judges to over rule the vote of the people............They can't win at the ballot box so they think they can win in the courts....It won't happen.get use to it................

5307,notsarc,"It is in the first place unclear to whom the ""further harm"" is done. But even granting that the fetus dies, it is not clear how the situation is analogous to abortion, because the intentions of not only the man but even more importantly of the pregnant woman are completely different."

5310,notsarc,"If one is prepared to put in a bit of research, that shouldn't apply on a web forum. One has time between posts to check what's being said, look for counter arguments etc. If the best one can come up with after all that is ""I know you are wrong but can't prove it"", then one is out of ones depth in the argument. The unavoidable conclusion from this, is that any claim to ""know"" the other is wrong is 100% faith based...G."
5311,notsarc,"This is more accurate, but let me modify it a bit.
 Without evidence there is no reason to conclude that there MUST be a god.
 A lack of evidence does not ensure that there is no god, just that we can't assume that there is."
5312,notsarc,"Right. Please, reread your argument. Not to mention what Woodward actually said about Piltdown man. www.talkorigins.org"
5313,notsarc,You just say this because you want to murder helpless wromb-trapped human beings. You cannot just say you personally believe something in a debate.
5314,notsarc,"My life was a gift from my parents, no more, no less. When i look in the mirror, i do not see an embryo. If someone gives you something, they have every right to take it away if they feel you are not suited to handle it, or if they had second thoughts. I would think this was ok if the baby was stopped in an earlier stage, but once its in its third trimester, you have no right to kill it."
5315,notsarc,"Ok, this makes sense. I do think however, that wanted pregnancies should be a part of the abortion debate, even though as you say, they usually are not. Part of the abortion issue (and the most important part, IMO) is the perception of pregnancy itself. If society moves in a direction where having a baby is looked upon as a negative thing, this is not good. One way to help make abortion rarer is to help people view having a baby as a positive thing. As Clinton himself once said, abortion should be rare."
5316,notsarc,"So, the Supreme Court rested its decision not on the 9th Amendment as the District Court had done, but chose instead to base it on the 14th Amendment."
5317,notsarc,I believe it is merely all known living species against those known by the fossil record and extinct. There are undoubtedly more extinct species that we are unaware of than living ones.
5318,notsarc,You haven't proven anything. All you have done is spew your same old drivel which ignores what I actually say and reinterprets it to mean what you want it to say. You must corrupt what I say since you can't accept the truth of my beliefs and win your fallacious argument.
5319,notsarc,"No, they're the same species. If you put all these fish in the same pool at the end they would all breed with each other. The example wasn't of speciation, merely of a change in a population driven by the environment, which is the essense of evolution."
5320,notsarc,"Oops, I think YOU made a mistake here on the second one.
 
 This is the correct inequality based off of my original equation.
 
 e-c<e+c
 
 So, start over again."
5321,notsarc,"Your view of choice is your belief. I don't ""believe"" that a pregnant woman or anyone else should be able to choose for the child. That child does not have a choice. Choosing to kill someone is a choice, but it is not a choice that should be legal. Therefore, you are forcing your view of ""choice"" on me by making abortion (murder) illegal."
5322,notsarc,"With regard to this statement you have to consider:1. How can anyone know what product an ""intelligent designer"" wanted.2. Even from the example of life on Earth we can clearly see there is nothing easy at all about the path life has taken over the millenia.But I think it is possible to hold your position, although it can be a tricky one by virtue of the entrenchment of opinions that has occured in the religion science debate- due to the less than pragmatic attiudes of some of the participants."
5323,notsarc,"But the Court went further than necessary. They set the point at which States could legally impose restrictions on abortion negating many state statutes in the process and establishing the ""right to abortion"" ON DEMAND at any time. That was an exercise in judicial activism. They took statures that existed in many states and arbitrarily determined at what point they could be applied. It's not the Court's function to legislate from the bench. It is up to the States and Federal Legislatures to determine at what point the fetus' rights are protected."
5324,notsarc,"Forgive me if this seems picky, but I just want to try and fully understand this argument. I should say that I don't necessarily agree with it, and would like to respond as to why. I just want to give a proper representation of your argument so that I can make a sound response.As such, you can no more force her, against her will, to provide bodily resources to an embryo or fetus, than you can yourself be forced to give of your bodily resources against your will.... Where does this right originate from, i.e., is it from the US Constitution via the 14th amendment etc?"
5325,notsarc,"No. That's the hypothesis. A theory has been tested. That means that from the hypothesis a prediction is made that has the power to falsify the hypothesis. In other words, the prediction must necessarily be true if the hypothesis is correct. Then an experiment is designed and conducted to test the prediction. When the hypothesis has been tested strongly, it is called a theory.From the evidence a hypothesis is formulated. The hypothesis is a proposed explanation that takes into account all of the observed facts. It is built on previous science, experience and sometimes guess work. Then comes the prediction, followed by the experiment that tests the prediction. If it passes, you may have a theory."
5326,notsarc,You can't...only admin can...and there's no need to be sorry.
5327,notsarc,And can you please tell me the difference between nonrandom variation and directed variation? I'd also like a link to verify what you say. Thank you. God Bless!
5328,notsarc,"Actually, one. After the adoptions years ago, we hit the financial slump and had a suprise... The costs will extremely low. I've also been in discussion with numerous friends who've delivered, same story. Somehow, no matter how there is no money and no help, babies get born. And as I've said, there are plenty of organizations that will cover all costs finacially in cases of adoption."
5329,notsarc,"Really? Then why haven't you condemned organizations such as the Brady Campaign? They continually put out the lie that the .50 BMG is capable of bringing down commercial planes as if the entire process was mere child's play, but there's absolutely not a shred of evidence to support this claim."
5330,notsarc,"I will agree science has disproven the literal reading of a number of different scriptures, such as the literal reading of Genesis (which was never meant to be literal to begin with, but that is a different matter).It also might explain why spiritiual beliefs exist for people.However, when it comes to this vaguly defined entity that alledgely created the universe, science has nothing to say about the existance of this alledged supernatural being."

He manifests a number of very interesting character traits. I don't believe that he likes women very much. In fact, I am rather concerned about how Cybererratus feels about women.Andrea Yates was certifiably insane and her killing of her children had nothing to do with post partum depression.And, she is being punished. She is serving life in prison -- as is Mr. Ridgway.I also find the comparisons that Cybererratus makes to be morally troubling."
5335,notsarc,"Of course not, but I fail to see how atheists are using science as its god, can you please explain that to me directly? Evolution doesn't refute god at all. In fact with evolution, intelligent design is entirely possible. But that still doesn't make it science."
5336,notsarc,"So ban guns? That is like curing the headache by cutting off the head. Why not make it a crime to sell a gun privately. Perhaps make it a legal requirement to go to a licensed firearms dealer who at no charge to the parties other than the cost of the background check run the potential buyer through the database. I would certainly be willing to do this. As a responsible gun owner, I would hate to think that the firearm I was going to sell to someone might be going to a felon, or someone likely to use it to commit a crime. "
5337,notsarc,Because A BALANCE needed to be struck! It doesn't go entirely in either direction. We need to balance the right to revolt against an unjust govt. with the problems created when everyone owns assualt rifles and bazookas and we have no registration. Either extreme presents a problem.
5338,notsarc,"So Pat is an example of gonadal dysgenesis (or an intersexual.) Are you sure it is correct to describe this condition as being ""made-up of two genetically distinct people""? Is is not the case that Pat is one genetically distinct person made up of two complete chromosome sets?"

5341,notsarc,"Atheism doesn't have that standard because it's not that encompassing a thought. All athiesm is, is a lack of theism, period. It says nothing about morals or ethics. Your typical athiest, though, looks within to find what's moral or ethical and it usually just stems from what's acceptable behavior within the human species. This is also where religion gets its morality and ethics. But times change, and eating shellfish won't kill you, and eating meat on friday won't make the farmers go broke, so the morals and ethics change to fit the society."
5342,notsarc,"If theres no proof that its genetic, then how can one say, with any degree of certainty, that it isnt a matter of choice? The professor attempts to discredit choice by stating there's no proof it is and promote genetics even without any scientific basis to do so. His selective use of ""lack of proof"" as his main criteria is dubious as a result. Some make the claim that nobody would choose to be gay because of all of the psychological baggage that comes with it. The teasing from straights, the parental pressure, etc., but we know that rebellious teens will do a lot of anti-social things by choice, so that argument doesnt fly."

If he gives you a prescription, go get it filled. If Jack's Drug Store won't fill it, go to Ajax Drugs, etc, etc.You can't force morality on anyone, anyway.

I'm gonna have to say that if I was talking to the assemblyman that they quoted said that to my face, I'd tell the little bigot that his filthy viewpoint sounds exactly like the arguments used against interracial marriage, against civil rights for blacks, women, and various minorities, and also against ending slavery."

However, it ignores the fact that parenthood is a relationship which is not defined simplistically by genetic relation or by being in the womb (it is unclear if he thinks surrogate mothers should be able to have abortions).We can be prosecuted for neglecting an adopted child or step-child, or anyone we have parental responsibility for. On the other hand, if a person gives their child up for adoption then they cannot be charged with negligence if the child is deserted by its new parents.One interesting part:"

The USA was the very FRIST government ever to be rulled by common and free men. When the USA first had the vote, Europe still had kings and emperors. Europe has become more like the USA and needs to work harder to become more like the USA. The USA had true freedom for more than 100 years before Europe started to get rid of their kings. In a few European countries they still have thier kings. I do not want to see a return of kings the the USA. Europe is almost like the USA, they just need to try a little harder."

5371,notsarc,Well I'm not arguing that this is adaptation...I have never said that.. What I am saying is the environment -- in this case diet is the cause for these traits to emerge in offspring.....but like I said earlier ToE does not admit that the diet or any enviornmental variable can influence traits in offspring. Traits are dictated by genes and genes are closed off from the enviornment. This is the basic dogma of Weismann's barrier. I'm not necessarily calling this evolution....I'm just simply pointing out that acquired traits can be inherited. There is no other way to describe this other than Lamarckism. Do you disagree that The inheritance of acquired characteristics is simply changes in physiology acquired over the life of an organism that are transmitted to offspring?
5372,notsarc,"But not all ""designs"" are manufactured. Take the repetitive ridges of sand on a beach. They are created by the motion of the water.

5373,notsarc,"Thanks for the link it was an interesting read.I found the comment in the second to last paragraph most intriguing:'Scientists have also identified the smallest number of genes required to sustain life in a bacterial cell (about 350).

If a non-handicapped person gets mad because they aren't getting disability and others' are, and those who prefer to protect disability try to do so by putting it to a vote, it's pretty disingenuous for the non-handicapped person to say ""voting on fundamental rights like disability is fundamentally flawed"". Disability may be a fundamental right for some people, but the issue is whether or not it is for ALL people."
5376,notsarc,"This does not mean that the column is fantastic nor imaginative. It may very well be that not all areas of the earth accumulated all types of rock that form the column; this does not mean that the years at which similar columns were deposited in different places in the world are not similar.

5377,notsarc,"Okay, here is how it went: God made the animals. He said,""Hey, Adam needs a helper."" He brought the animals to Adam to name. He couldn't find a helper for Adam. He then took a rib out of Adam's side to create Eve. This was done on the sixth day. God created them both on the sixth day, Adam first, then Eve out of Adam's side after he had Adam name the animals."
5378,notsarc,"A lot of work has been done on that topic. I would recommend reading Debating Design from Darwin to DNA It is a monster of a book, but it is definitely worth the read."
5379,notsarc,I know that. And it does not say when a fetus becomes a human being.
5380,notsarc,Well we assume a right to your own body here. It is also important for you to justify why there should be a difference in human and person and then justify why doing so this time is different from when this was previously done in history.I guess I don't agree with the idea that you have no rights until you can prove you should have them...if this is the standard then we are all in trouble.
5381,notsarc,"You contradict yourself. If the earth was then much as it is today, then there isn't enough water on earth to cover it in any fashion. I have done the math. Do you have any idea of how high the Himalayas, the Alps, the Andes, and the Rockies are? Besides, the Bible talks about a flood that lasted a year, not a series of tsunamis."
5382,notsarc,"Indeed. And that fact makes the old creationist plum about how evolutionary theory is dogmatic or that evolutionary biologists aren't allowed to disagree with ""standard"" theory a laugh.

5392,notsarc,"Again, true. But that doesn't take into account that there are two populations under consideration."

5398,notsarc,"Why don't we do the same for straight marriages then?Why doesn't a straight couple that gets married in Colorado, and then moves to Virginia, have to get their divorce ""remotely"" from Virginia.Or maybe you should start thinking about what AUTHORITY Colorado has to grant a divorce to Virginian RESIDENTS."
5399,notsarc,"Actually, it hasn't. Phylogenetic analysis has no relevance to Occam's Razor. Further, DNA for all organisms is the same until you examine specific sequences. It isn't that the DNA is different, what matters is the the sequence of the bases is different."
5400,notsarc,And he has still yet to provide one. If more gun-control means more lives saved then more gun-control means more self preservation.
5401,notsarc,"The purpose of the Bill of Rights.
Preamble to the Bill of Rights"
5402,notsarc,I dunno... we already have enough fundies thinking that the Big Bang is part of evolution...
5403,notsarc,I see. Then you are attempting to define evolution out of existance. By your definition (not that of evolutionary biologists) evolution requires an increase in information. An unsupported creationist argument. Define information in a meaningful way. Please apply your definition to genetics and show why all genetic changes are a decrease in information.
5404,notsarc,"Sounds like a fact which has been blown out of all proportion - possibly by the pro-gun side attempting to ridicule it. It is a fact, however, that the presence of a gun can increase aggression levels in individuals.See other times I have brought this up, here (to the end of the thread) and here (again, that post till the end of the thread)."
5405,notsarc,"And if we can actually doing anything about it. From what I hear on the fringes, the debate should not be about how to change or stop it, but how to change to deal with it and what we should expect as society adapts to a change in climate."
5406,notsarc,"What else would you expect from the people who created a god in their own image?
 
 Your thinking here is right, religion has a long history of being egocentric."
5407,notsarc,"Well, first, I did say ""The fact that you and I cannot understand this doesn't make it impossible."" Secondly, how is no god possible? Third, a person being 100% something and 100% something else isn't entirely impossible. There are people all over the world who change from 100% idiotic to 100% non-idiotic all the time. Lastly, there are many things we don't understand... so what's your point in restating what I said? "
5408,notsarc,"Bet the crime rate skyrockets,but I wonder what happens if you (officers)just
 put a bullet in them, you know for resisting arrest?
 
 Who does that pinhead mayor remind you of?emoticon_rolleyes"
5409,notsarc,"That is what supersport is hoping to do... However, assuming that you are correct in your interpretation, he has no chance of doing it so well."
5410,notsarc,"Yes, to follow his commandments to love God and to love one another."
5411,notsarc,"You have a habit of constantly posting statements by anti-gun officials. And when these statements and theories are called into question and challenged, you have nothing to post in defense."
5412,notsarc,"Agreed that they are still the same species, much like the ""13 species"" of Darwin's Finches, and I have no problem with evolution in that respect. I can even see the plausibility of different subspecies evolving eventually into different species if they are geographically separated for a sufficiently long time. But I still don't see where evolution, in that sense of the term, can account for dozens of species of monkeys occupying the same patch of rainforest, or dozens of species of gazelles occupying the same patch of grassland."
5413,notsarc,"No, it requires pretty much the same amount of faith, as if faith could be quantified.
 
 ."
5414,notsarc,"Again that is a poor analogy. Congress does not have any powers NOT included in the Constitution. Quite the opposite, it specifically says that any powers NOT included in the Constitution is defaulted to the states and Congress is additionally prohibited from taking any more authority NOT named in the Constitution.Since there is no specific naming article saying Congress does not have the power to ban manufacturing weapons, in fact it DOES NOT. According to the 10th Amendment:The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.Thus you have another poor analogy. Congress DOES NOT have the right to ban manufacture of guns."
5415,notsarc,"See above. Nothing has been demonstrated that convinces me that God has been ruled out of all these issues. He probably isn't active in all situations, but there's nothing that says he (or even Satan) are totally inconsequential either."
5416,notsarc,"i think shortej is not a creationist. he/she never said so, and started off by saying he/she accepts evolution and maintains her catholic beliefs. (i have a hunch its ""she"")"
5417,notsarc,"Because Apes, monkeys and chimps are on different paths. You wouldn't expect a shark to evolve into a barracuda-like animal. things evolve to fill niches, we currently fill a niche, there is nothing pushing apes, chimps or other primates to fill a niche that is occupied. "
5418,notsarc,"So what if he dislikes science? If he believes something else, he has the right to believe that way. My problem here is that he shows more closed-mindedness to the viewpoints of others."
5419,notsarc,This isn't discrimination because the adult once did have have the right to live in a womb until it could live otherwise. Once out of the womb and living on his/her own this right has been exhausted because there is no need to be living in the womb. Much like you can drive but this 'right' is exhausted when you are drunk or too old to see anything.
5420,notsarc,"It depends on your intention and your methods. Of course, things that don't have some sort of physical manifestation that can be measured can't be studied by science. Science is naturalistic. Scientific data can only include that which can be observed and quantified by natural means. I read it in a book of mythology isn't scientific."
5421,notsarc,"When someone lacks the ability to understand and the ganas to try, then it doesn't make sense. However, if you understood any of it, it would be different. After all, you repeat over and over again how you don't understand."
5422,notsarc,"Cars are a privilege, your gun isn't. Show me evidence that would support the registration of your first amendment rights being constitutional."
5423,notsarc,And you just did what you chastise me for in your next sentence
5424,notsarc,"The original molecule had some lipolytic function, but removing some amino acids from it, in the right place, made it fit better into the substrate, and thereby greatly increased its functionality. Barbarian observes:We thought it would take roughly a million years for bacteria to evolve enzymes capable of digesting nylon (because the compound is so different than any they were able to digest) but it took less than a century. ."
5425,notsarc,"Hundreds of thousands of atheist scientists do too, since common ancestry with apes harmonizes perfectly with the absence of a creator. They're seldom asked to answer about that confusion, however."
5426,notsarc,"I think that the bad guys will be happy if any gun control law goes into effect, because then there will be less chance of the victum having a weapon for their defense, and the crime rate will rise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5427,notsarc,Because....expansion occurs after heat is added. How can a expansion occur with a prior cause? You're saying the reaction and cause happen at the same time. Show me an example that does that.
5428,notsarc,"And we do. In some phyla, most of the partially-formed examples still exist. You can find them in mollusks, for example.
 
 http://www.pnas.org/content/vol104/suppl_1/images/large/zpq0120756920001.jpeg"
5429,notsarc,"Actually, I can not accept that claim. Before then, the absolutely youngest ever surviving fetus was deliver at 19 weeks, 6 days. 12 weeks would be a worldwide sensation. I would recommend that you double-check your source. Viability is still defined as the age at which 50% survive, which still is at around 24 weeks gestation/26 weeks pregnancy."
5430,notsarc,"If that were true, why are there millions of miscarriages each year? I don't believe a word of it."
5431,notsarc,It's not a literal account unless you interpret it that way.
5432,notsarc,"IF! But here's the thing, Mexico is making absolutely no attempt to truly stomp out the drug cartels, they're catering to them! Various political figures and police officers are on the take, they're getting massive amounts of bribe money from the cartels, stopping them would prove detrimental."
5433,notsarc,"Well, if they've re-established control in New Orleans(and it seems they have), then taking a gun away from someone carrying it on the street would be what the police normally do in any city. If they were taking it away from peoples' homes, and not letting them keep them, that would be over and above what they normally do. (I'm very pro-2nd Amendment, so don't get me wrong here. I'm just pointing out that taking guns away from people happens in every city every day)I also think that it's kind of disingenuous to complain about the military coming in--just a week ago everyone was criticizing the govt. for NOT sending in the military. Now people are criticizing them for doing it???"
5434,notsarc,"Because if you let gays marry because it is an alternitve way the equal protection says that if you let one happen you have to let the others have that right to. But that is not really my point my real point is that if we let this happend it will ruin marriage in this country, marriage is a bond between a man and a women and if we let gays marry this country will be ruining that tradition thus making this country more secular then it all ready is. AND WE HAVE TO STOP THAT."
5435,notsarc,"just isn't the case in countries with nationalised health care, yet those countries also have a large number of pharmaceutical companies that are based there."
5436,notsarc,"Are you saying that an argument that is inconsistent with science should not be called unscientific, or are you saying that it should not be rejected because it is unscientific?"
5437,notsarc,You have to remember that those christians believe that the laws of God superceed those of man. That thier allegiance is to God and his laws above those of the constitution. They also believe that all should be subject to Gods by force if nesesary.
5438,notsarc,"It is ALL repeated time after time, and time again then again. But you are correct. Here is one of the links to those studies. emoticonXSmilie http://www.4forums.com/political/gun...tml#post354115But what do we do about this? http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcon...dennis_culhane Which is a study of criminals shooting criminals but it is hoped that people will think it is about Law Abiding Concealed Carry. This is NOT representative of Law-abiding Concealed Carry or legal gun ownership in any way. And we have this.Guns and Death - Firearms Research - Harvard Injury Control Research Center - Harvard School of Public HealthSo lets look at the actual crime figures to see if any of this holds water.  According to this 1999 article  there were 250 million guns in circulation in 1999.   Total NICS Background Checks November 30, 1998 - June 30, 2009 "
5439,notsarc,"Okay, you are right... we need a definition for a 'hole,' as it is a bit of a subjective concept. Allow me to define 'hole' like this: The void created by the intentional destruction of something already in existence. Using 'hole' with this definition makes Alcorn's statement (minus the word 'terrible') a true fact in the physical realm. And it precludes any of your other ideas from creating 'holes,' since they all deal with potentiality, not reality."
5440,notsarc,"religion: commitment or devotion to religious faith or OBSERVANCE
 
 religious: relating to or manifesting faithful devotion to an acknowledged ULTIMATE REALITY or diety
 
 Therefore we can conclude that atheism and agnosticism are religions."
5441,notsarc,"I'd say there were a lot of stones going both ways.
 
 Do you know the Rev. well enough to be able to make that claim, that he's a bigot? Or is it he represents the system?"
5442,notsarc,"I know exactly what you were saying. And it seems I was right, you have nothing to back up your claim that people were betting that it would fail. It's just something you're ""sure"" of, i.e. something you made up. Like I figured."
5443,notsarc,I think you mean to say is hunters not liberal democrat hunters. Actualy I know of very few hunters that only have rifles or shot guns they usualy also have pistols to since you can hunt with them also.
5444,notsarc,And those pillars will be replaced by something stronger like equality and Justice.
5445,notsarc,"She should not have the baby in the first place, and thats what im saying. The only irresponsible move a 12 year old would be making is not having an abortion, as she is not physically and emotionally capable of raising or bearing a child."
5446,notsarc,Stop trying to muddy the waters. I asked you to back up your claim that gun control is racist. That is not asking others to do my work for me. That is asking you to back up a claim that you made.
5447,notsarc,"First of all, the government cannot increase the volume and social acceptance of a drug - only the market and society can do that. Government cannot even decrease the volume or social acceptance of drugs - despite the government's efforts, drug use has remained relatively constant. What hasn't remained constant is violent crime, which has gone up during the drug war as it did during alcohol prohibition."
5448,notsarc,Well it came from somewhere and presumably changed as it went along.
5449,notsarc,Straw man. I am not attacking the achievements of science. I am attacking the notion that you have that scientists are exempt from the catalogue of influences that affect everyone else; with only the slightest admission of a tiny possibility of cultural influence - which was quickly dismissed anyway with the false analogy of comparing evolution to aeronautical engineering.
5450,notsarc,"But growth is fairly irrelevant. My sperm can grow into a human too, and have mental existence, yet ejaculating isn't murder. It just becomes a huge debate on where to draw the line, therefore it is best to focus on the state that it is right NOW. Not what it was or could possibly be.That seems reasonable to me.[/QUOTE]"
5451,notsarc,"Over 10,000 signatures of Christian Clergy have been collected, and have endorsed this letter."
5452,notsarc,"This stat sounds more than a bit inflated. Seeing as it comes from a website called ""women's issues"" it is probably not all that credible."
5453,notsarc,"There is a pretty huge difference.Civil unions aren't nationally recognized, for one thing, since not every state has them. If you travel to a state that does not offer civil unions, then your union is not valid there.I think there's a problem with dissolving those unions as well.The big difference, though, are the rights that these unions provide. There are over 1,000 legal protections and rights that marriage provides that civil unions don't. I'll try and find a list of differences."
5454,notsarc,"That's a nice silver-lining take on the situation, but you and I both know that there are times someone who has a greater and more pressing need for the job (even to feed his family) gets put aside for someone who doesn't need it as badly. The issue here isn't ""fairness."" This issue is doing unto others as you'd have them do unto you. If you're going to hold the golden rule up as a rule, you have to be consistent."
5455,notsarc,"No, but the Roman persecution of Christians, covering Christians in pitch, Roman garden parties, witnesses for Christ being killed for their faith etc. is as irrelevant as it gets. Just be careful, that's all I'm saying. There is a place for that topic."
5456,notsarc,I think you just made the point that they're people after a certain degree of development takes place.
5457,notsarc,"So which is it: the action is moral, the action is immoral, or there is no answer? You seem confused."
5458,notsarc,"As Mach pointed out, you (Montalban) are arguing with yourself here.You stated that ""bacteria needing nylon to survive"" is put forth as evidence for evolution. Then you said that an alternate view was that there are some bacteria that need nylon to survive.Anyway, an actual alternate view is that the experiments performed to determine whether the bacteria could survive on nylon alone could not have been exhaustive. There may still be a natural substance on which the bacteria survives. It may even be similar to nylon, but it has yet to be discovered. This is a big maybe, though."
5459,notsarc,"Really if this is another one of your fresh organic sample = age of decades of time capsule because they were both on top of the ground, you're officially delusional."
5460,notsarc,Pretty good considering Darwin wasn't aware of genetics. Too bad Wells is stuck in 1859. The modern synthesis provides perfectly legitimate mechanisms.
5461,notsarc,"You think ""the unborn child is worthy of protection""...""but not more so than the mother, probably less""...yet you believe ""in most circumstances the child should be carried to term?"""
5462,notsarc,"Well, I'm sincere in how I interpreted what he wrote, and I honestly believe that is what he meant."
5463,notsarc,"If I am to believe in something even if it's scientific, I should be able to challenge the belief's of the person who's pushing it. If they don't believe in what they're selling, why should I."
5464,notsarc,"Yet without it the vessel is just worms, mud, then dust, like rock & tree houses, not made to endure, yet, the life force, energy, back to the cosmos/source, converted, capable of being rewinded, paused, and fastfowarded, like a movie screen amongst the stars, revealing our lives."
5465,notsarc,"Well, man has been called the third chimpanzee. Cladistics is some decades old now, and it has suplanted the old Linean system. While discoveries are still assigned genus and species names, evaluation of morphological charisteristics by computer yield much more realistic evolutionary trees."
5466,notsarc,"But they didn't have sexual relations. This was from a sperm bank- there was nothing that made the two people create one being. Nonetheless, this is a side issue for future debates. My main point is homosexuality is a disorder that the government shouldn't be condoning. The government obviously doesn't condone pedophilia, poligamy, and incest. Why is the government condoning homosexuality?"
5467,notsarc,"Evolution's evidence is that life is similar, you won't be able to find an exception I am sure."
5468,notsarc,"The US is still the closest thing to a pure capitalist country in the world. But you are correct, our system is not a pure capitalist one. We have reminants of all types of systems including socialism. In the modern world I don't think a society as large as the US is could be run under just one pure system."
5469,notsarc,I thought I had worded my post quite clearly. I even pointed out that it appeared that Dembski thought that there were only three laws of thermodynamics and claimed to have discovered a 4th (which he of course named the 4th law of thermodynamics). He seems unaware of the zeroth law.
5470,notsarc,"""Healthy Families"" seems like a strange name for this group that the link is to."
5471,notsarc,The burden of a pregnancy is the woman's. It should be left up to her and her doctor to decide what is best for her.
5472,notsarc,"Because you've presented no credible evidence to support the claims that private transactions are an established and major source of firearms for criminals.
 
 If you can't prove it's broken, you don't have grounds to call for fixing it."
5473,notsarc,That's right. It merely has the capacity to make errors which sometimes slightly improves function in a particular environment. And those tend to accumulate over time.
5474,notsarc,"SNIPThis opinion piece was put forth by the Violence Policy Center, the same people who opposed all forms of firearms safety training and gun locks, because they might encourage people to feel that they're more capable of safely operation a firearm. The Violence Policy Center also pushed the idea of an ""assault weapons ban"" because it was easier than a handgun ban, claiming that the uneducated people are unable to tell what is a machine gun and what isn't a machine gun, making passage of such a law all the easier."
5475,notsarc,"What's ridiculous is your mis-reading of the argument. I'm both discussing individual pharmacists, and their refusal of service to individuals based on the drug the individual wants, which is already assumed to be dispensed at that pharmacy or chain."
5476,notsarc,Because the effectiveness of other methods don't come close to that of owning a gun for personal protection. If they did then the police wouldn't have guns because it would be redundant and not cost effective.
5477,notsarc,"""Lottery""? I hope you don't mean that it is completely random in all cases...
 
 Note: did you notice that this was the position you were arguing against in the previous sentence?"
5478,notsarc,"Well if there can be a Constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, why not to remove marrriage from the federal government? Where do they get that power Constitutionally? So that would mean states can choose not to recognize any marriage Constitutionally. I think that marriage is a church issue. Let gays, straights, everyone get civil unions to be recognized legally. But leave marriage to the churches."
5479,notsarc,"Well, the slavery analogy for gay rights is past it's applicability at this point--one was a property issue (also rooted in deep prejudice), the other is a morality issue. Many people oppose gay marriage out of morality and NOT prejudice. The same can't be said for slavery. There are many ways that the analogy doesn't work and that's just one of them. In fact, it could as easily be an analogy to reverse it and say that the ones who did the enslaving were analogous to gay rights lobbyists and the abolitionists were analogous to those who seek to protect marriage. After all, the plantation owners were the ones really fighting for ill-conceived rights--rights that they shouldn't have had. "
5480,notsarc,Marriage is a secular condition set up by various Societies over the millenia and one of the prerequisites set out is that such a union should be between people of different genders.Religion has supported this and sanctified it but did not invent it.You don't curse the Church you lobby Society to see if you can effect a change. People who believe the different gender aspect are entitled to lobby for no change.
5481,notsarc,"Ya know Doc, it is really hard for someone to travel to a shooting sports event in another state. One would usually have to drive or go through ridiculous lengths in order to transport their firearm. I am glad to see some sanity in our laws now! Although I sincerely doubt that the Antis are happy about it."
5482,notsarc,"How is that a strawman? Your challenge directly relies upon something you assume to be proven, but has not been. Therefore even in a hypothetical stance, your underlying arguments are invalid, thus leading to everything else being invalid. You're not doing so well on this forum."
5483,notsarc,Just as soon as peddler's cheek stops stinging and he picks the glove up...
5484,notsarc,"Well, to say it has no mental existence doesn't really tell the whole story. The fetus WILL have (more than likely) full mental existence in a very short time. It seems to me that if you ""view humanity with mental existance as important"" you'd also view as important that the unborn baby WILL indeed reach that point, in all likelihood. "
5485,notsarc,Any form of legislation is a voting matter. That's the way our system works.
5486,notsarc,"I believe the earliest gospel estimation is placed around 50 ad, which is almost 30 years after Jesus died."
5487,notsarc,"But then, there also is absolutely no evidence for such an intelligence."
5488,notsarc,"Yes. Oddly, the picture makes as much sense as most creationists. :)"
5489,notsarc,"well yes that's what he did, but he did not try to present this as positive evidence for anything. the biomorphs were used to illustrate the point that random mutations are much more likely to produce beneficial results when the mutations are small. analogies always break down at some level, this analogy was used to illustrate a certain point. the assertion that dawkins was suggesting that a biomorph happening to look like a real life object were proof that evolution and natural selection could produce such creatures is false. montalban, to restore integrity i suggest you retract the conclusion you drew from snippets and quotes from dawkins as your paraphrasing was clearly not representative of dawkins' ideas."
5490,notsarc,"And I would like to know why that is. I asked the question in post #2 and got no answer. Are laypersons lacking in intelligence so much that its hopeless for them to be on the same communication level with scientists? Since they share the same society, put their pants on one leg at a time in the same way, eat, sleep, and share economic processes in comparable ways, it seems to me it would be beneficial for them and laypersons both to understand each other when they use identical terms. (like the word, theory) "
5491,notsarc,"Well, at least you realize that.
 Just the way some apes became humans and some became chimps."
5492,notsarc,"That interpretation is fine except that God says, ""I WILL make a helper suitable for him."" He hadn't made the animals yet in verse 18, but he created Adam in verse 7."
5493,notsarc,"The bible is evidence. Its existence is a fact. What that fact represents is subject to interpretation. Ken's argument is that choosing to believe the bible is infallible is no more or less of a presupposition than choosing to believe that logic is infallible. He's right in absolute terms, but those axioms are not equally congruent with reality."
5494,notsarc,"Hence why this forum is essentially a joke. Without PRATTs, creationists have nothing. Go to the link in my signature for a place that cracks down on PRATTs."
5495,notsarc,"I see a subtle distinction here. Creationism is concerned with the spiritual origins of people. ""Evolutionism"" is entirely concerned with explaining the nature and history of the physical world. The conflict of opinion arises out of the importance of the detail- can Genesis be accepted as a parable which contains a fundemental truth or must it be taken as a historical account?"
5496,notsarc,"Good shooting! Got two illegal alien perps that had been deported for previous felonies and just committed another after illegally entering the country again.WE NEED MORE JOE HORNS and a heck of a lot less bradies!Is this the only case you could find of a CCW exercising his rights (you know the law applies to any citizen of Texas don't you and they need not be licensed?) completely justified in the Penal Code of Texas.

5497,notsarc,"1) Charliegone's article was a published research article.I would love to know where ""NARTH's"" editorial was published, if it even was published.2) NARTH's article DID NOT show any ""higher homosexual activity"" because of legalized gay marriage.It thoroughly failed to show ANY rise in homosexuality in ANY ""gay marriage"" country. It showed some studies which were reportedly done in those countries, but that's it."
5498,notsarc,"Yes, everyone is a ""potential"" felon. Fortunately most people never commit a felony. And there are many different types of weapons, all which could be used by previously law abiding citizens to commit an act of violence."
5499,notsarc,"No, the question is why you let violent individuals remain free in public."
5500,notsarc,"I wouldn't say most cjurches, because you cannot prove that. There is a long list of churches that are accepting of gay folks."
5501,notsarc,"Actually you're wrong. Actually you're very, very wrong. The 5th Amendment, and all the other amendments in the Bill of Rights, only provide protections against government interference, not interference from your neighbors and people who don't have governmental jobs.But just for the sake of argument, if you want to argue how the man's rights were violated, how about we discuss the rights of the woman? Doesn't she have a right to not be raped? Doesn't she have a right to be secure in her own home against forced invasion?"
5502,notsarc,Giving an answer to a conumdum doesn't necessarily solve it.
5503,notsarc,"Yes it is true that homosexuality was controversial, however it was not the controversy that lead to the decision being made to remove it. It was the act of one doctor who was sympathetic to homosexuals. It was the choice of one individual, based on compassion, not factual data. Patently dangerous and wrong in my opinion. "
5504,notsarc,"Accidents for one. Just last week a man who was drinking and cleaning his firearm accidentally shot and killed his daughter. Run a google search for ""man shoots self"" the amount of accidental shootings is rather disturbing yet funny. Most of these however are due to improper gun safety though."
5505,notsarc,"AH! the old ""information"" gambit. It only shows that anyone who uses this doesn't no what they are talking about. Take a biology/genetics class and you'd realize how stupid this sounds.
 
 Thank you for finding this page!!!"
5506,notsarc,"God can do whatever He wants. Although one can say ""God does not"" or ""God is not"", a thiest believeing in and worshipping the God of Abraham and Joachim I do not think should ever say ""God can not"" anything....With God, all things and everything is possible. Sentiments such as those expressed above in my view seem to be evident in Western Christianity where it seems believers are too often trying to bring God down to our level, imposing limits etc."
5507,notsarc,"And the risk to minority's civil rights is, of course, the reason for the bill. They are, after all, limiting what can be started via initiative, not eliminating the initiative process altogether. The fraud was merely an example of why the change is needed. As has been argued here before, if civil rights need protecting, it's from the majority. Allowing civil rights to be modified via the initiative process simply makes it too easy for the majority to impose it's will on the minority. That's not what a Democracy is about, at least not our Democracy."
5508,notsarc,"I guess I'd have to reluctantly admit that it didn't take long for some....but I'm an eternal optimist and think civility will prevail. Besides, I try not to judge everybody by the acts of a few."
5509,notsarc,I have never disagreed that marriage is a special dependent class. My point is that it is a society-sanctioned special class.
5510,notsarc,"Well, it was not conceived through an act of love but by an act of violence. Granted, it isn't the babies fault and that would be a very sad situation. I suppose, even being a pro-lifer, that I could get behind justifying an abortion due to rape in consideration of the unwilling, violent conception and the mental trauma of the mother BUT I think that the rape should be reported within 24 hours for the person to qualify for this ""loophole."" It should be reported BEFORE the victim is aware of any pregnancy. Coming forth weeks or months after the fact is too suspicious and gives the appearance that they are just crying rape as an excuse for a justified abortion."
5511,notsarc,I hardly see why you feel called upon to explain how a hypthetical entity that does not in fact exist requires an explanation at all! There is no evidence of any sprititual entity or spiritual component to any physical entity.
5512,notsarc,"Oh, I hear you. I am covered by my partner's insurance here as well. I would not have been able to get the insurance if we were not legally a union. It's amazing. And I am REALLY greatful for that!"
5513,notsarc,They were both created on the sixth day according to Genesis 1.
5514,notsarc,"With all due respect my friend, this is foolishness. It's as if you're saying that a persons existence is based on their memories from their past. That is ridiculous because if it's true then, we oughta take every person who's in the throws of Alzhiemers out and euthanize them because they can't remember what they did yesterday. Just because you can't remember what you did at 4 doesn't negate for one moment that you still existed at 4 so your existence had value and substance even though you can no longer remember what happened back then in your life."
5515,notsarc,But the point is why are there relatively few creationists. The reason is that the creationist position cannot be defended in open debate. That is why creationist boards censor opposing views. On boards where creationists are not protected there are few.
5516,notsarc,And how does this compare to your ideas on artificial selection?
5517,notsarc,"But a slightly larger brain than average is still feasible and offers enough of a benefit in a large social group that its worth the price - however something the size of a modern humans brain is far too demanding. That slightly larger brain can be supported by an organism or society that hasn't developed fire, but is also able to discover the uses of it, from then on nutrician isn't the big limiting factor that restricts how big a brain can get from then on. "
5518,notsarc,"Interesting, but it appears to ignore the fact that there is pre-existing variation (just look at the pictures). Emphasizing mutations is ok, but relying solely on them will probably skew results."
5519,notsarc,Once again as the noose tightens and they see their days are numbered. The religious elite feel their power and hold over the masses slipping. With Iowa and Vermont being major victories they'll stop at nothing to instill fear and confusion upon the American people to try and stem the tide that has been long overdue in rising.
5520,notsarc,"No, you are mistaken. Evolution is concerned with the change in allele frequency over time. The age of the Universe is irrelevent."
5521,notsarc,"again, please explain what possible benefits you forsee with teaching intelligent design. Please show me where it is anything than a belief. Evolution was always considered science. It used the scientific method, and offered evidence for everyone to see and peer review. Until the ""theory"" of intelligent design does that, I will always be forced to put quotes around the word theory, because it will simply be a religious belief."
5522,notsarc,Some? 90% is more than some in my opinion. That is a horrible waste. Just think if we could retain 50% of the energy we consumed. We could start eating 1/5th of what we normally eat.
5523,notsarc,"Accidents happen, that's just how life works. They're tragic, and they're upsetting, but there's no way to avoid them."
5524,notsarc,Why are you dishonest enough to claim that you aren't trying to get YEC into the schools.
5525,notsarc,"You are wrong in your claim.
 The power of the 14th amendment, applied to ensuring equality, has a very real history.
 Would you care to look at how the 14th amendment has been applied over its history?"
5526,notsarc,"if the only choices we can possibly make are the one God approves, then we dont have free will, because we cannot free choose the option that God does not approve of, which means we are forced to only choose the options that God approves of. this is not free will"
5527,notsarc,"Certainly science has provided part of the answer with their finding of the Mitachondrial ""Eve"", suggesting that one person can have all the DNA necessary for all the variation in human populations.One of the standard rebuttals you hear is ""How did the Kangaroos get to Australia""? I don't know if that's covered in the Bible... if God transported them or not."
5528,notsarc,"If he lies about being pro-life, what else will he be willing to lie about in order to be elected? That is a legitimate, not-made-up issue that is relevant to elections."
5529,notsarc,That is what it said. Now your website gives a false translation to this. It clearly is talking about if the unborn is harmed.Not to mention the numerous other quotes I gave you about how a person (in the Christian faith) is formed before conception! This shows that God has already created you. God also talks about how you can't kill a person he created. This is an easy concept to follow.I suggest if you wish to learn what the Bible says you read it and not take what a biased website has to say. Religioustolerance.org is a joke that misleads people into making God what they want him to be.
5530,notsarc,"I think the currently popular belief is that time itself is limited. Space, time, energy, matter and laws all came into existence together. Of course that's impossible for us to envisage...."
5531,notsarc,"So producing a child is the defining characteristic of a marriage? What about love, trust, respect, companionship? My wife and I may decide to not have a child, does that mean our marriage should be made illegal? Again, you keep posting nambla this and nambla that. Nambla is a group of deviant pedophiles, homosexuals despise this behavior too. GROW UP DHARD...I mean DMG2FUN. ;)"
5532,notsarc,"**Not true. I most certainly do apply EAM to all empirical observations of biological originality, just to see if it still applies. To date, it always has. As for darwinian interpretations of that same evidence, presenting them and defending them is your responsibility, not mine."
5533,notsarc,"Gay Blog - QueerSighted
 
 This is long overdue.
 Marginalizing gay couples by failing to acknowledge our existence is ending."
5534,notsarc,"all you have to do is scroll back a page or two in this forum...look for my posts regarding cichlids, guppies and lizards. I also gave you snails. show me any example of so-called natural selection or evolution in the field and I bet I can shoot it down."
5535,notsarc,I think you are the same person as usa all the way and again.. you have no right to talk about murder because you murder the english language everytime you post.And no.. the baby does not belong to god because there is no baby and I don't know if there is a god or not. Btw.. I'm not going to incubate something in my body because of you think it's wrong because someone who may or may not exist said so.
5536,notsarc,"Well either the Pottenger cat/pig/mouse thing is either the truth or they made the whole thing up. I think we are seeing a mirror of this experiment in society today...please notice how diseases are striking people at younger and younger ages....it's not going to get any better, either because people are not taught the reality about nutrition -- and that what they eat not only effects them, but their offspring as well."
5537,notsarc,"Nothing ""proves"" evolution. However, there's an overwhelming amount of evidence that supports evolution."
5538,notsarc,"Mmmmm, not necessarily. Many of the arguments of against gods (those with specific properties, not just a general diety) deal with incompatible traits, like a square circle has. One does not have to search the universe to know square circles do not exist.People state simple negatives all the time. The lack of evidence for the positive makes them reasonable."
5539,notsarc,You don't beleive that it is possible to do something wrong to prevent a larger number of wrongs in the future? Do you think the ends can ever justify the means?
5540,notsarc,"Ah, but the issue in this thread is what the fetus really means to anti-choicers/anti-lifers."
5541,notsarc,Tell this to those infants and adults in the netherlands who are being euthanized against their will. this is a logical conclusion of a quality of life ethic without a sanctity of life basis.
5542,notsarc,"Hang on....think about it.......if there is a large group of people who live in the south, and this large group of people moved to the north, WHY -- being from the south -- would there be anyone in the population that had light skin? Look at Iraq -- all those people have the same exact skin color. Same with Kenya. Same with Japan. Same with Russia. Thus, if any of those groups of people were to migrate, they'd all be in the same boat! There would be NO measurable variation of skin color. Your premise is faulty -- as is the whole premise of Toe."
5543,notsarc,"Well, since you have natural selection completely wrong, it must not go too well with the Biblical account. By the way, now you have introduced another word that has no meaning in the context. What is a ""kind."" Please be specific so that I will be able to recognize a ""kind."" Please show why a ""kind"" only has the ability to lose information."
5544,notsarc,I will stop quoting here. Don't want people to have too big a read. Actually ToE isn't all that random. To a certain degree yes. But Sexual Selection aka a part of the ToE. Dictates that when there is a benificial/attractive change. That change will be enhanced almost exponentially. Because the female of the species will be programmed to search for that and will carry the gene herself so will give it to her off spring. And the male will be more succesfull so produce more off spring. So no instant eyes or anything like that. I think that's what you were implying. Sorry for responding in Kronus's stead. I'm sure he can defend himself but I found it unjust the way you replied to his post and attacked it on foundations that you didn't have.
5545,notsarc,"And THAT'S why we have these things called judges - so they can rule such things to be unconstitutional. And yet, for some reason, you and your fellow anti-gay people are always complaining about judges doing just that."
5546,notsarc,"But, of course, religion is a mere matter of brainwashing and programming. Some people, very obviously, need this sort of intrusion into their lives because they can't figure it out for themselves.And, there are some very profound and meaningful religious teachings.However, if one is not permitted to question the tenets of a particular belief system, I find that dangerous.Like in your sect. You do expect complete obedience, do you not? No questioning of your authority?"
5547,notsarc,"While I don't follow the whole ""child trap"" thing,... whatever it is,...
 
 Would that be any more ridiculous than the notion that a vagina is an entrance/exit to personhood?"
5548,notsarc,"And depending on what human is ""finding the answers"" it can unfortunately cheapen and deny many central Biblical teachings."
5549,notsarc,"Our emphasis on Police and crime fighting reduced crime. Not gun control!
 
 Our murder rate is largely an Inner City drug and drug gang related problem. Fix that and then you will finally be doing something!"
5550,notsarc,"Also another example put forward is a bacteria that can only sustain itself by eating Nylon. The theory goes - nylon is a recent invention therefore this bacteria must have eolved recently.What it suggests however is that a portion of an existing population would have died if not for nylon... the bug has to have nylon, or it will die.It is akin to looking at a portion of the human population who would die from heart-trouble. But thankfully we've now got artificial hearts, therefore this portion can survive. They are not a new species of human, but live only because of a recent invention."
5551,notsarc,But it isn't an assertion of absolute truth. It is actually an assertion of the consensus of current scientific thought. I have read some discussion about various other possibilities. Maybe several forms of life arose in various environments. Eventually they then had to compete for resourses and all but one went extinct. And then there is the hypothesis that life arose more than once and fused into a single population. The bottom line is that the DNA code is universal with only a few minor differences in a limited number of primative organisms.
5552,notsarc,It doesn't have to be that way because it's the death penalty. It's that way because of our ever deteriorating legal system.
5553,notsarc,And if someone had written an ad proclaiming that black Americans are inferior the same thing would have happened as well. I can't justify what they did but when you put such a hot-button issue out like that into the open...it has to be expected. People have strong feelings about abortion rights (just like racism) and it is naive to think something like this wasn't going to happen.
5554,notsarc,You could try to be a good person and nevermind about the hocus pocus stuff. I'm not tryimg to convince you of anything. The fact is that what you use a reasons to believe don't hold up under logical scrutiny. Don't justify faith with logic. That only cheapens faith.
5555,notsarc,"What possible concern is any of that to you? 
 Some actually search for knowledge through debate. This is a debate forum if you recall. Don't play if you're not so inclined but to post warnings not to fall in this trap, c'mon."
5556,notsarc,"Absolutely true!I discovered that with my fluoride research...For whatever reason, most people take another's word for what the truth actually is instead of searching for it themselves.If the lie is an easier pill to swallow than the truth pill, they'll take the lie. emoticonXFrazzled"
5557,notsarc,"Not to hijack the thread, but there's a question about ID that I've never been able to get an answer to. arn.org didn't help, but maybe you can DamEtel?What was the Designer supposed to have actually done, and when? I mean, did he create the first single celled creatures from scratch and dump them in the ocean billions of years ago, or did he just nudge some chemicals towards each other? Did he cause specific mutations in certain animals at some point to get a desired result? Or did he build animals from scratch, fully formed? I can't find any answers to these questions anywhere."
5558,notsarc,"Well this doesn't answer my question though. With this bill, where is the money coming from? Are we cutting doctors jobs? I hate to use a Krugman thing but this looks like an ""underpants gnomes"" theory.1) Pass Senate Bill2) ???????3) Save $3,000 per capita."
5559,notsarc,"Nobody I know sanctions adultery. There are already serious consequences built in against it. As far a same sex marriage, I know of nobody that is suggesting legal penalties for it unless one considers the refusal to legally recognize it a legal penalty. Certainly nobody has been jailed or fined for attempting such marriages. Privately performed ceremonies as such are not punished."
5560,notsarc,"Actually, for his hypothesis to explain the difference, he would have to say that the DNA changed. Even so, he assumes more."
5561,notsarc,So although you provide absolutely no evidence or source to back up this claim we should just accept that the memo is authentic until some disproves it? How does such reasoning even begin to make sense?I'm very suspicious about the legitimacy of such a memo. Here are two bogus quotes attributed to Sarah Brady by some people on the pro-gun side:
5562,notsarc,"Well, certainly I don't expect to change the minds of millions of Americans, and that is not my goal. My goal is to convince readers of my writing that Americans SHOULD agree with same-sex marriage because it is morally correct to do so."
5563,notsarc,"And you people whine at me about using personal insults (emoticonXCry )... anyhow, once a fetus is eight months, I believe, they are fully developed and ready for a premature birth. I was born prematurely, so don't tell me it doesn't happen. So if you get an abortion at eight months, you're not killing a fetus, you're killing a baby."
5564,notsarc,"That is not quite what the 'mitochondrial Eve' hypothesis posits.Science. 1995 Dec 22;270(5244):1930-6. The myth of Eve: molecular biology and human origins.Ayala FJ.University of California, Irvine, USA.It has been proposed that modern humans descended from a single woman, the ""mitochondrial Eve"" who lived in Africa 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. The human immune system DRB1 genes are extremely polymorphic, with gene lineages that coalesce into an ancestor who lived around 60 million years ago, a time before the divergence of the apes from the Old World monkeys. The theory of gene coalescence suggests that, throughout the last 60 million years, human ancestral populations had an effective size of 100,000 individuals or greater. Molecular evolution data favor the African origin of modern humans, but the weight of the evidence is against a population bottleneck before their emergence. The mitochondrial Eve hypothesis emanates from a confusion between gene genealogies and individual genealogies."
5565,notsarc,"Well memory is NOT something that is immaterial is it. Its always implemented in the form of material processes well known to biochemistry. Metabolism, ion flows, neuron activity and interconnections, along with potentiation of those connections into networks.Free-will of course is what we call the experience of our choices being not wholly determined by external states alone. By no means does that exclude the fact that our internal states (of which we are largely ignorant) also play a role. The autonomy arises from the operation of the brain and those internal states. Again a purely materialist explanation. And there is no evidence of anything other than material processes in the experience of free-will. In other words neither memory nor free-will require a non-materialist viewpoint."
5566,notsarc,I think such a move would qualify as a recognized declaration of war.
5567,notsarc,"Given that the fetus can feel no pain (in the vast majority of abortions), whose pain should I be concerned about?
 
 Even if it could, why would its pain be more worthy of protection than the mother's?"
5568,notsarc,It isn't offered to make that assertion at all. It is offered to show that God values the life of the unborn if He will demand that a man responsible for causing its death in the womb be held accountable by paying the ultimate price.

5570,notsarc,"No Ted Kennedy is not a fundie but Vitter is. For God sake the pope is a nazi and a fundie.Marlene Elwell, the nazi *itch, who put the evil mariage amendment on the michigan ballot is a Roman Catholic also. If you are a christian and you believe in the suppression of homosexuality then you are a fundie and a christianist."
5571,notsarc,"Yes I do. Anytime there's a mass killing, you and your ilk are holding it up as an example of how we need more gun control, how we have to reduce the rights of the people so those that die won't have died in vain."
5572,notsarc,"would that be legaly owned guns, or criminals who have guns (and also ues guns) for there crimes? most Gang members have guns, if they are killed in a drive by shooting, is the gun responsable, or would it be the illegal activitys?"
5573,notsarc,"The argument that the baby is not a parasite, but is rather 'in its natural environment' seems a false dichotomy: it is natural for a parasite to be in the enviroment of another's body, invading it. The relationship element will be dealt with in the third section."
5574,notsarc,"That doesn't teach (here is the topic braille) student athletes anything, it is discrimination and violation of their 2A rights.
 
 Drugs are just a strawman. Strike three!"
5575,notsarc,"Well, the people in Iraqu that we are killing are terrorists that just want to make chaos so they can come to power in the confution. We also went to war to remove Saadam from power. He killed 200,000 people. most of them were tortured to death. So yes it makes more sense to kill terrorists that are trying to kill as many people as possible than to kill little children that have not been born. Besides, babies are so cute :p"
5576,notsarc,"I believe you, OTHERS pick and choose what you believe. What is sad is how many lose their faith when they find how much they have been mislead."
5577,notsarc,"Cost would certainly be an issue. If the adoptive parents were willing to take on that cost, that would be best. I wonder, though, how much demand there really is out there for adopted babies. As I understand the situation, currently there are far more parents looking to adopt than there are new babies up for adoption. However, if such an artificial womb would exist, then that may not be the case any longer. Would the mother then have to be responsible? Not that easy a case to ponder since that would be a case of performing abortion not purely out of a sense of a woman's right over her own body (since transfer would be an option) but out of purely financial, practical reasons."
5578,notsarc,"Well Steve ""murder"" is a legal term that does not apply in abortion. But for the sake of keeping this simple - yes, and not only that, it's legal."
5579,notsarc,"Your continued comparison of a person exercising their constitutional rights, to engaging in deviant and possibly illegal sexual acts, has reached the point of intolerance, Smith. Every time you mention the word fetish, you're gonna be reported. So unless you wanna get banned cut it out."
5580,notsarc,"You seem fairly intelligent. However, it is you who seems ""highly confused"" over the definition of murder. You see, you are speaking in terms of legal jargon as it is applied inside a particular country. I'm referring to the moral implications of taking the life of a defenseless person without its consent. I might have better represented my argument to you by stating: we will never know with absolute certainty whether or not am unborn human constitutes a person, and thus whether or not aborting them constitutes killing them, i.e. murder in a strictly moral, and not political, sense.In response to your attacking on my saying we are glad we weren't aborted, yeah it has no bearing on my argument and I put it in for fun. Good for you to spot it."
5581,notsarc,"The article cautions on blithely using natural selection as an explanation for the features of the genetic code.
Article 9:
In this article, the functional integrity and how the architecture of the code relates to it is discussed.
From the article:"
5582,notsarc,"No, in other words ""the cut and thrust of peer review."" Where ID falls flat on its face. Stop trying to dress that up as some kind of underserved mugging; if you aren't prepared to understand and defend ID on a scientific level you aren't equipped to decide that it is being unfairly treated."
5583,notsarc,"Too late, drug usage has already created those epidemics. Legalizing drugs may increase some of them temporarily, but they already exist. I would argue that there would be a decrease in crime, for certain."
5584,notsarc,"The gene and therefore the enzyme it produces. LPL is the designation for a gene that encodes Lipoprotein Lipase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes lipids in lipoproteins. The actual gene encodes a protein of 475 amino acids that becomes a mature protein of 448 amino acids after cleavage of a signal peptide. One study was able to identify 3 common SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) in the coding region of the gene, 2 of which result in small changes in enzyme function in European populations. The third SNP converts that locus to a stop codon and results in an enzyme that is 447 amino acids long. Thus, the enzyme has been truncated. The resulting enzyme, LPL S447X, is functional. In fact, it results in lower incidence of vascular disease and lower blood pressure. Other truncations result in non-functional enzymes."
5585,notsarc,"I don't have any belief in this area. I don't know how life started and accept that I probably never will know. It might have started through a God ""magicking"" the first cell into existence, it may have started through purely random natural processes or anywhere in between the two. One only has belief and faith in this regard when one claims to know how life started. ""I don't know"" is not belief."
5586,notsarc,"Yes. I would. :) [As long as I can exercise 'critical thinking', along the way w/out personal attacks.]"
5587,notsarc,"well then back up your claim. Saying ""I'm sure that..."" doesn't make it true."
5588,notsarc,"I believe you've missed the point. He's not against evolution; change of species over time into other species. He in fact, from what I can gather, does indeed believe in evolution
 
 He's arguing that it didn't come about through materialistic processes."
5589,notsarc,"What is your evidence they didn't do this? Remember, today's Coelacanth is different."
5590,notsarc,It's one thing that stands between us and a mindless theocracy. It protects the freedom of women from would-be ayatollahs who would make them sexual slaves.
5591,notsarc,Stop trying to muddy the waters. I was talking about developed nations with lower murder rates. You suddenly bring Chicago into the debate- a city with open borders in a nation where guns are freely available. Even if gun control hasn't worked there it doesn't follow that gun laws can't work on a national level. 
5592,notsarc,"We know that now, but not because the sun rises every day, because we have identified other evidence that proves heliocentrism.The hypothesis ""the sun orbits the earth"" predicts it will rise and set every day, the hypothesis ""The earth is rotating"" predicts the same."
5593,notsarc,"There are certainly other theories, but the big bang is the only one supported by the evidence."
5594,notsarc,"Same thing happened in Rwanda. First they put the names of all Tutsis on lists. Then, the Hutu came around with machettes and took them off of the lists....permanently. emoticon_wow"
5595,notsarc,"That wasn't my question. My question wasn't what you said, but what you believed. You sort of answered that. But the same people spouting off about the second ammendment being the reason for guns should also be for it defending your right to a nuclear bomb."
5596,notsarc,"You mentioned him once or twice. I could give a rats a$$ about him. My concern is for you or anyone else who is in your situation. If you end up getting shot, as you walk towards that light remember you had ample opportunity to have prevented the dire mess you may find yourself in! It was not the guns fault, heck it really was not your brothers fault... It would have been your fault because you failed to act. This line has nothing to do with my position on guns or trying to get a ""one up"" on the debate. You are in a dire LIFE THREATENING emergency much worse than me owning every mortar, grenade, f16, m16, ak-47 in the world. Do you get it?"
5597,notsarc,"Read to the very end of the verse. ""If you are not pleased with her, let her go wherever she wishes. You must not sell her or treat her as a slave, since you have dishonored her."""
5598,notsarc,A little of both. Japan is known for allowing its police officers to physically and mentally torture suspects and deny them legal counsel if they determine that such counsel will interfere with their interrogation. Suspects aren't allowed to read confessions before signing them either.Is that what Penfold really wants?
5599,notsarc,"NOt true,California's ammendments are not doing as well as other states did. You are talking about a very liberal state. If it is decided that marriage is allowed by the courts, then you are talking about taking away rights people have been granted by the courts. I just don't think that will happen in Calf. much too liberal."
5600,notsarc,"I don't get why either side thinks it matters much. There is evidence that many, many behaviors we see have genetic roots; including behaviors that are unacceptable to society. It is not like something being genetic necessarily matters one iota in terms of the morality the behavior associated with it. So it's just as strange that some feel proving gay-is-genetic will matter as it is strange that some feel that disproving it will matter. The moral issue of homosexual relations will go on regardless of the genetic debate, because quite frankly, one is not dependent on the other."
5601,notsarc,"Actually, according to your use of the word ""person,"" she is. A significant percentage of fertilized eggs fail to implant and are instead passed. How sad (and typical) that you haven't bothered to educate yourself about these things."
5602,notsarc,"Well let's deal with one thing at a time. The NEJM study about Washington D.C. concluded that banning handguns saved 47 lives each year. The study didn't conclude that it was just a ""curious relationship in the numbers."" Go back to that thread and read the study. If you're looking for evidence that is absolutely without any degree of uncertainty then you won't find it. You can't prove things to a 100% certainty with statistics. What you can do is show what is probably true and what is probably not true. Even in court you're not expected to prove that someone is guilty to a 100% certainty. You're expected to prove that they are guilty beyond a reasonable doubt."
5603,notsarc,That seems unlikely. He gets banned everywhere he goes with his multiple names. He's not very good at hiding his identity and not very good at controlling his temper when dealing with the sort of creation believing XXXXXX that you get frequenting these boards (I can't say I blame him on the latter point).Look around the web though and you will find him elsewhere...
5604,notsarc,"So-called ""Partial Birth"" Abortions are so rare as to be negligible. This ban was just a small step onto taking away a woman's right to choice.If it were a ""born baby"" then they wouldn't have to perform the abortion. It would be able to survive in a respirator.There you go again misusing a legal term.You are the sick one for using emotional arguements and ignoring the facts."
5605,notsarc,Being in the minority or in the majority is irrelevant. Belief has no bearing on reality.
5606,notsarc,And what would that prove? It would certainly show that an animal adapted to survival above the Arctic circle was not adapted to the Arizona desert. Maybe it would indicate that the environmental conditions necessary for the change aren't present in Arizona. How is that relevant to evolutionary theory?
5607,notsarc,"Please start with the Bible passage.
 Then explain what you mean by ""stretched out"" and why this would affect our perception of space and time."
5608,notsarc,"That statement exposes your ludicrousy. First, you say you're against killing children who don't have a chance. Then you say the death of the Kurds and the WTC mean nothing to you. What chance did the children in the gassed Kurdish village have? What chance did the children in the WTC Day Care Center have?"

5610,notsarc,"Then thats as far as we can go on it, and thats fine. Not being a science worshiper myself, I simply dont automatically take this type of blanket statement as automatically true. What largely prompted this thread happened last Tuesday - 6:30 AM, and a six-figure weather forecaster scientist guy assured everyone watching him that a pretty nice day was ahead, largely cloudy yet with peeks of sun, with a slim chance of very spotty rain. 2 hours later, the beginning of widespread heavy rain, for three solid hours. Unusual of course, but if we have scientific blunders concerning a few miles, I can imagine we could have a few blunders concerning hundreds of thousands of light years. "

5616,notsarc,"Agreed. That is why a sensible interpretation, of new data, is so important! :)"
5617,notsarc,"I think it goes something like that. Scientists have tried to repeat what they believe happened, but to no success. Anyway, atheistic evolution says that there is no intelligence, the scientists who were trying to repeat what may have happened have intelligence and they made many such measurements to try and create life from lifeless chemicals - in other words, the experiment was already logically flawed!"
5618,notsarc,"I think bringing ""emotions"" into the question of whether God exists or not tends to cloud the issue a bit.Isn't the essence of atheism a rational enquiry which concludes that in the absence of any credible evidence, there is no reason to believe in God ? An emotional attachment to ""non-belief"" would be irrelevant (and irrational)."

 Evolution excludes God."

5623,notsarc,"Reading Difficulties, huh?
 
 There's a cure for that. It's called school. Perhaps you should go there....."
5624,notsarc,"What are you talking about? Please define information. What does ""new"" information have to do with natural selection or evolution? Evolution is NOT defined by evolutionary biologists as an increase in information.So I ask again, please define information in a meaningful way as it applies to DNA and the genome of an organism."
5625,notsarc,But we also don't know that evolution is true - it is a belief system about the past that requires faith for it to have any reason. Your first part is already false (proved above).
5626,notsarc,"It's all in how you word the questions.You worded the questions with an obvious bias, they did not come across as an honest attempt to learn, but rather as a challenge.Word them properly, and I guarantee you that the people here will be most helpful.WaxyP.S. Your username has a large affect on how you are initially perceived."
5627,notsarc,And what if it is one to me? Then your refute is equally refuted. The support for us not knowing lies in you and other's inability to provide anything beyond speculation as support for the assertion that an unborn child is not a person. Your own inability is my support.
5628,notsarc,"What laws are these that you speak of? Kindly provide the bill name and number so you have some actual proof and aren't simply parroting from the fear-mongering Brady Campaign and Violence Policy Center.During World War II the American people rounded up Japanese-Americans and herded them into concentration camps because you were at war with the people of Japan and thought that they were the sleeping enemy even though they had no proof. What you're speaking of is no different than this.The way I see it Brady, your hatred for guns and gun owners is so overwhelming and logic defying, that you'd be perfectly alright with unleashing a life-ending pandemic plague on the people of earth if you believed it would put an end to all gun owners everywhere."
5629,notsarc,"Humans are about the furthest thing from perfect. The bible IS perfect, it's flawless. You can't take anything from it and prove it to be incorrect. The only thing that even comes close is misinterpretations of certain sentences. I know plenty of people who don't believe in any sort of God and aren't bothered by the thought that this is all they have, the only life they'll ever live. Maybe some people need to believe in more to live more, but all people don't."
5630,notsarc,"That's the standard dance. Victor Stenger didn't say it that way. On the back of his book, one review puts it this way;"
5631,notsarc,"I believe you mean pro-choice, don't you. A pro-life mod might agree with you."
5632,notsarc,"And that part of the decision (not allowing for the woman's health to be taken into account) is why I do not agree with nor do applaud this decision (in fact I am rather disgusted with it). If you'd like to see a more concise view from me, you can see the thread that Another_opinion started here: http://www.4forums.com/political/abortion-debates/9678-mothers-health-exception-where-do-we-draw-line.html"

5634,notsarc,"Oh, is THAT where you are getting your information? The Biotic Message? I read the book tens years ago and eventually sold it because it wasn't worth keeping. You do know that it is a book on biology written not by a biologist, but by an engineer. Right? Walter Jame ReMine is a mere engineer of some sort, and has no degree in biology. And biologists strongly argue against his claims. PS: I even had a few exchanges with ReMine when I was posting at ARN. I argued against him, even though I was an IDist at the time, because he was not being truthful."
5635,notsarc,"And if you rewind a little over 40 years, the exact same thing could be said about interracial marriage.Archie's reply is a non-argument, and false at that.Multiple other groups state discrimination in marriage, but there are LEGITIMATE STATE INTERESTS prohibiting their marriage.Little things like child rape, lack of consent, and other issues."
5636,notsarc,"You couldnt be more wrong. Our goverment was built on the word of God. Its ALL OVER our founding documents. George Washington was quoted to say ""You cannot call yourself an American and subvert the word of God."" Your only argument can go back to the sep.of church and state. Which is new compaired to when our laws were drafted. So not always... just unfortuanatly now. Which is a BIG mistake by the way and could be the downfall of our country. Try again..."
5637,notsarc,And why do you pick that point? What makes fusion an individual? It doesnt start growing just because it was fused into a cell.
5638,notsarc,Finally someone answered the question. Thanks. I thought it might be the government.Does your government attempt to do this?What do you think about other democratic nations that have citizens that are less armed? Do you think that they're in danger - or is it only the American government that's out to do this?
5639,notsarc,"No, it's often an emotional show. They choose their families based on submitted videos, usually from families with one or more physically challenged members, then they build them a house to fit their needs.There was one in particular with a blind autistic boy who loved to swing. The joy on his face when he got the new swing would make any sensitive person weep with joy for him. There was another about a deaf couple whose new home included and lot of strobe light signaling systems.BTW, alcohol is a depressant! emoticonXWow"
5640,notsarc,So a theory was revised... does that mean that it was wrong afterwards?
5641,notsarc,"Exactly so.
 
 Pro-choice people would not impose their values on anyone; profetallifers would impose theirs on every woman of child bearing age.emoticon_angry"
5642,notsarc,"Yes, it recognizes there will be religion in our country, it allows all to follow which ever religion suits that individual as long as it does not impose upon others who do not follow that religious system. Our constitution allows for dissent, opposition and opinions. It actually requires such dissent in order to come to conclussions which would serve everyone equally. If for some reason there is a practice which excludes certain individuals from the protections of the law, then it needs to be challenged."
5643,notsarc,"No, thats not right. Evolution only deals with the diversification of life, not its origins, and most certainly not the origin of the universe.As typically defined, evolution is descent with modification -- or in equivalent population genetics terms -- change in allele frequency in a population over time."
5644,notsarc,"What you must realize is that is the case for evolution as well, we don't have enough evidence to know; this is common in science but it is only the political drive of Darwinism that found that state unacceptable. (you don't see them teaching kids about black holes and unified field theory because we don't know much about it)"
5645,notsarc,"Actually, creation explains nothing. Evolution is an observation that is explained by theories that explain why populations of animals change. One explanation is the theory of natural selection."
5646,notsarc,"It can't come up with evidence if it's suppressed from future generations. Until you can show that happenstance origins are science, you have no basis to declare that intelligent design is not science. I agree that I haven't shown how ID has a potential advantage to the political corruptness of today's scientific community, but I've shown it's potential advantage to our society. I've shown how thinking is involved with it, the type of thinking involved in any school class involving philosophy, which you said science classes should have."
5647,notsarc,"I think this is a fair conclusion. I went as far as I did because of what it seems to say about the governor calling for a joint session. I may be wrong, but the text seems to instruct the governor to keep them in joint session until final action is taken. In other words, it doesn't appear that the governor has an option. And it does not seem that the Constitution allows for a legislative session that never ends. I'm not sure how else to square the two except that the legislature should pursue final action. Of course, as you have pointed out, it really is hard to speculate on this one without any historical context of the amended Amendment Process, and/or the relevant legal precedent surrounding it. Any thoughts on this?"
5648,notsarc,"Well, it seems to me that if you have a reflex it means you have an at least partially developed and functional nervous system which would tell me that you can feel pain."
5649,notsarc,"Wow, I think this is the first time I've ever heard anyone claim that the pro-choice movement is for the sake of the child. Sorry, you aren't even close. I don't know a pro-choicer period that would say it's for anything other than the sake of the woman."
5650,notsarc,"But evolutionary theory doesn't claim that species arise in a single generation. How does it make your point to argue against claims that evolutionary biologists don't make? In fact, is it honest to misrepresent evolutionary theory?"
5651,notsarc,"There are precious few areas on the planet that have not been explored. Those that haven't would not support the kinds of life we are talking about. There is no evidence of any interim species of apes and humans. Not one shred. Those items in the fossil record that are claimed as possibles are only possibles, are dubious at best, and are extremely rare. A recent study also showed that most characteristics of supposed alternate species of hominids were well within the variation seen in current homo sapiens. The point I was making is that if they existed we would see them."
5652,notsarc,"You may have missed the context from the other thread I referred to.The point I made is that the unlikeliness of a Presidential signature did not stop Senator Obama from voting in favor of a required Iraq troop withdraw timetable. The promised veto threat didn't matter in this instance. He was ""standing on principle."" Well, same would apply for his newfound views disfavoring DOMA as well in my view."
5653,notsarc,"Well, I'm not sure if he consumed alcohol or not, but his doctor gave him daily ""vitamin"" shots that contained vitamins as well as amphetamines and maybe other drugs that doctors at the time thought were mentally beneficial.And I've never heard of him being a vegetarian. I saw some show that talked about his voracious apetite, but I don't think they mentioned his being a veggie."
5654,notsarc,"If a God exists, then God is as God is."
5655,notsarc,I think that scientists don't work with religion and religion has no place in science class.
5656,notsarc,"Because of my rH factor I have had several spontaneous abortions. I have never needed to have an induced abortion.
 
 I am very sorry to note that I felt not a whit of regret over my abortions. I had more important things to attend to."
5657,notsarc,"Actually the Alan Guttmacher Institute is quite reputible. They have their own web site. Check it out. Also, why would a site called ""womens issuses"" be in valid?"
5658,notsarc,"No when talking about the ark, I like to agree on what we are talking about when using the term kind. And I like to give the person that believes in the flood the opportunity to define it. That includes whether they think dinosaurs and other extinct animals were on the ark. So Im interested in how you define kind and your opinion on the dinosaurs and others."
5659,notsarc,"maybe firstly you should explain how god works? In what way does he manupilate matter in defience of the laws of physics, where does he dwell, how can we not observe such a being? And all the other questions of the supernatural. The theory of a god is actually a lot, lot more complicated than evolution as you have to explain *how* God works to get even basic science points."
5660,notsarc,When is wealth redistributed on a whim? The NHS is one of the few good things to come out of WWII and is the mark of a fair society (if you ask me). Restricting health-care according to wealth is despotic....
5661,notsarc,"You know, I heard that from my mom last week. My parents moved to Arkansas when my dad retired a few years back. Mom thought it was amusing and disgusting that the state she moved to would have voted in such an alarming manor yet takes no measure to secure the marriages they already have. Ironic indeed."
5662,notsarc,"I guess I should ask why you think the ""less evolved"" chimpanzee should have gone exinct?What happened is that common ancestor to chimpanzees. for some reason, was divided into at least two populations which did not come into contact with each other much. One population evolved into the modern chimpanzee (a forest animal), and the other into modern humans (a savannah animal)."
5663,notsarc,So you're accusing me of the thing that your most guilty of? As I remember your posts have been censored several times by admin because you resorted to viscious personal attacks and name calling. And aren't you interested in the truth. Why isn't whether Jefferson said it or not important?
5664,notsarc,"So any long publication must be due to a panic attack? It takes a few minutes to read those posts, but it takes an hour and a half to watch Expelled; does that mean that IDers are having the mother of all panic attacks?Your logic can't even be described as ""tortured,"" marc, because it's completely nonexistent."
5665,notsarc,It did not because it was not clear till the 1970s that horizontal gene transfer was something to be considered. Nobody knew the mechanism till that era. And of course HGT is just another form of variability to be taken into account.
5666,notsarc,"Your right, this is not complete free will. But as I mentioned before, if you give yourself free will, then you are saying God has no control over you or your actions -- and therefore he is not God anymore."
5667,notsarc,"From my first post, starting with the quote from the religioustolerance website;"
5668,notsarc,"That's a bit of a sidestep. Abortion is not genocide because abortion is not destruction of a certain group of people based on race, religion, ethnicity, etc. There is no way to make a case for abortion being genocide without making capitol punishment qualify as genocide. Frankly, I think it's easier to do the latter (yet most pro-lifers are also pro-death penalty).If you want to make an argument, then make an argument. But don't call abortion genocide; that's just dumb."
5669,notsarc,"Any belief system is a religion loosely defined. I'd like to know how you think rights are afforded to born persons if not by a belief system or at the very least a belief in natural rights. Either way, that doesn't address the point I had. If I can't impose my beliefs on you then who you are to impose your belief of me not hurting chemist99a?"
5670,notsarc,"This is why the title is ""God exists!!! (but he's not who you think he is). It's a funny proof which I don't think Christians would agree this definition was God. But basically it's saying that take the set of all human beings. Call the greatest God. God exists.Not only that, but the final conclusion is one of the premises. The proof is one big circle :)"
5671,notsarc,"She could, but not all do :) Despite the fact that it works, there are still unwanted pregnancies :) That doesn't change the fact that a pregnancy would not be pleasant to a woman who does not want to be pregnant :)Forcing pregnancy by law is a step toward fascism."
5672,notsarc,"1 - It is innacurate. We allow killing in times of war, in self defense, and in state sanctioned executions. So we already have a situation where, when given X mitigating factors, it is justifiable to take a life. It is impossible to say all life is equal, and then to apply that as law. People will be outraged. I know I would be.2 - Objective to who? Who gets to decide how valuable life is? And why should they get to? And who says they are right? The relative value of life works fine, thanks very much."
5673,notsarc,just cause you dont buy it doesnt mean it is not true. that life is sacred does provide a (if not the only) compelling altruistic basis for and responsibility to social justice whether it is actually walked out or not. I think that the fact that it is not really walked out in america proves that the majority of americans are not pro life (including a majority of those who actually claim to be pro life). This doesnt negate the truth though.
5674,notsarc,"But wouldn't the biochemical similarities speak for themselves? That is, does one have to believe that the two specimens (which share biochemical similarities) evolved in order to infer that they will respond similarly to antibiotics? The observable facts of the similarities would seem sufficient (and more scientific?)."
5675,notsarc,"Thats another subject.
 
 In all, you have not answered the OP. The insane suggestion that abortion cannot be murder, because murder is illegal and abortion legal."
5676,notsarc,I have not heard of it before either. Any information that you or other member's can gather on this subject would be of great interest. I will also keep my eyes open.
5677,notsarc,"As Arthur Jones described in the copy/paste in my first post, there are benefits. You have not addressed what it said."
5678,notsarc,"Except several rligious organizations around the country have financed, and gathered signatures to put anti gay marriage amendments on the ballot. They have a religious belief that marriage is between one man and one woman. They have turned this belief into law regaurdless of the religious beliefs of gay people. Any one who has voted yes to place these amendments into state constitutions because they have a religious belief that excludes gay people from marriage has also imposed those religious beliefs upon gay people. In short I have been barred from marrying the person I love because someone else, that I do not know and who does not know me, has some sick religious belief."
5679,notsarc,"So then if I owned a business or a piece of property I could then refuse to sell or accommodate fundamentalist anti gay Christians and ""That it has been ""open to all for years"" carries no weight whatsoever."" It is my property and I don't like the immorality of fundamentalist anti gay Christians."
5680,notsarc,"So they had guns that could shoot down planes even before they had planes?
 Their primitive muskets were that powerful? I am not that easy to fool!"
5681,notsarc,"Because of the history of it. Well, ID is actually identical to 'scientific creationism', but spruced up with more scientific terminology to attempt to pass 'seperation of church and state'. Let's just say that I.D. is an attempt to teach Creationism in school."
5682,notsarc,"""Ready to go"", in the sense that living things are equipped with a means of making small errors which are used by natural selection to make new structures.Barbarian, regarding mutations:There is a lot of that. Many mutations are recessive and a population over time accumulates a lot of genetic variation that can become useful if the environment changes. The founder population of lizards, for example, could have had at most, 20 alleles for any gene locus, since each lizard can only have 2. The new ones evolved by mutation. Sometimes, we can even observe that happening, or trace the mutation back to a known ancestor. Would you like to learn about it? ."
5683,notsarc,"Just a couple points of clarification...
 
 o It may grow into post-birth human person. It may not. 
 
 o It can already be considered a human child before birth by commonly accepted definitions of the word 'child.'"
5684,notsarc,"Do you see cops driving down the road, going over the speed limit, turning on their lights during rush hour to get to their exit which is just a little ways ahead and then turn their lights off after they exit the highway. People who enforce the law think that they are better than the law, and don't have follow the law, even if they enforce the law, or make them, i personally think that is Bull****!!!"
5685,notsarc,Prove it! Prove that there would be no rooted trees at all within the sedimentary layers at all. And prove that there would be no tracks or burrows or evidence of plant life as we find. In fact we would expect to find all of those things as evidence that this event was fast and cataclysmic in order to find all of these things together in the same areas.
5686,notsarc,"Religious faith, by definition, is a ""jump in the dark"" and there is really little(if any) common intellectual ground on which Creationism and ScientificMaterialism can meet. In principle, given adequate evidence etc., there isnothing in the material world that cannot be explained by Science. Butsomeone who has, so to speak, already jumped into the dark cannot see this.The most interesting questions that a supernatural account of human life can raise are concerned with the evolution of law, morality, social conventions,aesthetic sensibility and such like."
5687,notsarc,"Because some restrictions that might pass constitutional muster, don't amount to an outright ban. How would impossibility ever be considered constitutional?"
5688,notsarc,"Actually it is the creationists who don't know what they are talking about. If they wish to talk about cosmology, then by all means talk about it. Just don't pretend that anything discusses has any bearing on evolutionary theory."
5689,notsarc,"Nothing. ""T. Kennedy"" is an alias of a known terrorist."
5690,notsarc,"Yeah, it does have risk unlike the embryonic stem cells, but I think that if it comes out the way they hope, it will eventually lead to more embryonic uses as well when people realize that this can have risks. I think it is good to have this way as a back up while people argue over the use of cells that would otherwise be disposed, and get some treatment to people who need it rather than letting it be denied to them by anti-abortionists. And yeah, it's pretty much guaranteed that someone will find something to object about, claiming it is immoral (maybe it will now be that these stem cells are potential human life and we can't use them emoticonXRolleyes ), but it will likely not have as many objections."
5691,notsarc,"I think even the Court knows that the Fourteenth was not well crafted, at least in terms of forsight. However, once it was ratified the Court really had no choice but to try to work it into the legal landscape.Certainly State power needed to be curtailed to stop such institutions such as slavery, but I don't think restructuring how the entire Constitution works was the right move."
5692,notsarc,"actually i have a fuzzy theory on how the water on the earth could actually cover land. most scientist agree that the 7 continents were at one point one single flat super-continent (gondowaland, i think). after the continent sections drifted apart, only then did the himalayas and other major mountain ranges and ocean gorges formed. so it could have been possible that all land mass could have been covered by a heavy enough global rain shower, at least until it all drained off. however, scientists argue that this supercontinent existed millions of years before noah, so yall can scrap that idea...unless the scientists were wrong and the continental split happened quickly, while the earth was under water...nevermind... like i said, a fuzzy theory"

5696,notsarc,So what?   Why should the woman be forced to care for this child against her will?
5697,notsarc,"No. We don't agree. For one thing your faith isn't a theory. Creation as described in Genesis is a myth, in fact, two myths. Furthermore, a scientific theory doesn't mean ""wild guess with no foundation"". That seems to be what you want the word to mean. In science a theory is an explanation for observed facts that has been tested. You see, a theory is predictive. I'll give you some examples of scientific theories. The germ theory of disease, the theory of gravitation, the heliocentric theory, tectonic theory, atomic theory.   Moreover, you are wrong that science cannot observe actual evolution of life. It is done all the time. While it may be debatable that a virus is alive, the recent case of SARS making the jump from civets to humans after a mutation is evolution."
5698,notsarc,"Whatever, people lying by saying that they lost their jobs because they said they believe in Intelligent Design? Good? Bad? Utterly predictable?   http://www.expelledexposed.com/index.php/the-truth"

5700,notsarc,Warm today near 80f. Not a cloud in the sky.
5701,notsarc,"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/03/science/03angi.html.   I've had three children, which gave me an opportunity to observe intimately the development of infants. Also, I worked with emotionally unstable children aged 3 and older, and observed what a delightful species the three-year-olds are. At that point, infants have progressed from the largely self-involved awareness of the 24-month infant as the developing human deals with the problem of separateness and, as a result, issues a robust declaration of independence. No! No! No! are the bywords of a two-year-old. No! I won't! And you can't make me!"
5702,notsarc,"See above. Whether a couple is or isn't monogomous is not for you to determine or worry about. And speak for yourself if you don't mind. This member of the American public's mental health is just fine thank you very much. If gay marriage impacts YOU that much, well that sounds like your problem."
5703,notsarc,"Actually, they are genetic. Our cells have receptors which are triggered by exposure to pathogens; that's how we ""learn"" to fight off a disease. And not everyone has the same receptors, which ones you posses is a genetic trait. It's one of the reasons that Native Americans were so vulnerable to European diseases, they hadn't evolved the receptors that would have enabled them to build up defences against the diseases the Europeans had lived with for generations. If your hypothesis was correct we wouldn't see different populations having different reactions to the same disease."
5704,notsarc,"Same place. Australia.   That, after 5 or 6 thousand illegal guns were just handed in during the last in a series of never-ending amnesties."
5705,notsarc,"You keep claiming that, but you never reference it. I'd like to see sources and names. Just because evolutionary sources don't claim to be engaging in a PR exercise doesn't mean they aren't doing it. There is plenty of evidence of it, even if they don't honestly admit it."
5706,notsarc,"Oh, I don't know about that. March of the Penguins was a box office success ANF an Oscar winner for best documentary.   Calling any of Moore's movies ""a documentary"" requires one to employ some artistic license with the term and some slight of hand."
5707,notsarc,Jake good try at manipulating scriptures. Jesus is all about family values. The point of thsoe scriptures is that His gospel is above everything else. The only thing that comes before family is GOD. He loves families but won't let a family bring someone down. The US rescues kids from bad homes too because to be in an enviroment that is detrimental serves no one.
5708,notsarc,Kronus said this was a win for science. He never mentioned that religion was discredited- never mentioned religion at all. Religion and science are utterly unrelated. Why would you make that connection?
5709,notsarc,"There is just one thing however. The coelacanths found are different from those in the fossil record. Further, ALL evidence pointed to them being extinct, until we found other evidence, and we changed it. And, to top it off, the article says NEARLY extinct, not COMPLETELY. Although, this article was of course written after the coelocanths were re-discovered. Of course, this has absolutely nothing to do with the theory of evolution, which explains the mechanisms responsible for the change of allele frequencies in populations over time."

5712,notsarc,I see. So you can't give an example of a dinosaur being dated with carbon 14. None of us thought you could.
5713,notsarc,"Well, you know what happens when they try to eliminate waste. The opponents start screaming that the government is ""rationing"" health care.   In any case the inclusion of the 40 million uninsured wil be financed mostly by waste elimination. At least it is a start. The status quo is untenable.   The essential point here is that the universal healthcare systems in Europe, Japan and Canada deliver MORE healthcare for less money. It is not the case that in Canada, healtcare is in short supply because the government is rationing it. They are ahead of us in all metrics except waiting time for non-essential surgery. One example is the waiting time in emergency rooms as some of us have actually experienced. We may not be able to achieve the same efficiency overnight but we have to stop putting our head in the sand."
5714,notsarc,"Wait, an ad hominem that even skews the stats?   You could at least compare monthly to monthly, or yearly to yearly.   You could point out that his modifications decreased his energy consumption.   You could tell us whether that number included time while renovations were taking place, if you even knew.   You could clarify whether this compensates for natural gas, propane, or heating oil usage.   You could explain whether the amount ""burned through"" is from the grid alone or also includes the non-impacting solar and geothermal contributions.   But doing so would require not being a rightwing parrot."

5716,notsarc,http://www.wistv.com/Global/story.asp   Racial hatred and more racial hatred and more racial hatred!
5717,notsarc,"So funny... Like others have pointed out, this dialogue has nothing to do with evolution. It's a ridiculous story otherwise as well...   1. How many secular teachers talk about God in class? I've never had a teacher in any of the secular schools I went to say anything about God, for fear of the controversy it would create. Teachers live in fear of controversy, they don't want to get fired. I think this idea that non-Christian teachers try to convince students that God doesn't exist is a fundamentalist paranoid fantasy.   2. How many atheists use the ""you can't see it so it doesn't exist"" argument? very few. They will use the ""there is no evidence so I don't believe you"" argument, but that has nothing to do with whether Timmy can see teacher's brain."
5718,notsarc,"I think you do not know what you are talking about. Your description fits the matter ""god"" you belive in."
5719,notsarc,"Liberal, not Democrat. Believe it or not, there are pro-gun ""thinking"" Democrats."
5720,notsarc,"Well said. Most Americans favor more gun control, but unfortunately this majority of Americans tends not to vote based on the issue of gun control while a very vocal minority composed of gun activists definitely does vote based on the issue. This is something politicians have realized since 1994 so they have been more hesitant to support gun control. There probably will be more gun control supporters in office in the coming years but I'm not sure how much this will change things."
5721,notsarc,"well, based on this argument, why shouldnt we kill mute, paralysed, vegetable, comatose, and very very drunk people, since they all cant think, or if they can they cant communicate that they are thinking. How about new-born babies that dont know anything? how about retarded children?   you are fooling yourself if you think that women undergo abortions because they dont like that particular ""part of their body"". women undergo abortions because they dont want to raise the child when its born. until you face that truth, you'll be arguing under a dellusion"
5722,notsarc,"Well, I would call it a formalized set of rules and procedures for evaluating the validity of propositions. How does that relate to a dogma with a higher refresh rate?????"
5723,notsarc,"Did I say that? No.   I blame a society of judgemental, unintelligent people. Nothing to do with how you view abortion or reproductive rights."
5724,notsarc,That's incorrect. The Constitution begins with Article 1 which does not contain the Bill of Rights. The Constitution contains seven articles which are followed by the Bill of Rights and the rest of the amendments. If you really are from England as you claim then I guess your lack of knowledge about the American Constitution is understandable.
5725,notsarc,"You bring up a very interesting point.   All those state level marriage amendments which were voted on also made civil unions illegal as well. When polled, residents in those areas were actually unaware that the amendments also outlawed civil unions.   So, not only are the anti's disingenuous as far as what they promoted, but were so in HOW these amendments were promoted."
5726,notsarc,"**   Silly thinking. Evolution is a natural phenomenon that requires explanation; it explains nothing, it simply is what it is, i.e., a plain fact of life. It is an effect, not a cause, and except among some darwinian true-believers, effects are never their own causes. In this particular instance certain organisms we call eubacteria have evolved inter- and intra-cellular communication systems--a phenomenon not found in, say, grains of sand or salt or the various molecules, atoms, quarks and other 'things' that 'bits of stuff' can be reduced to by materialist/mechanist darwinists.   **   Forgive me, but I'm the one laughing now!! That you find this behaviour non-indicative of intelligence only points to a certain lacune on your part as far as that quality is concerned.   **   Sorry, just can't stop laughing. Foolish words do that to me every time."
5727,notsarc,"it is no ""story""........i am debating on the whole evolution thing... look at the facts. so many great ppl, physics people, niels bohr, he was for evoulution, then he found out all of the facts that it is junk, so he became a christian"
5728,notsarc,"But what you are being challenged to do is to give some evidence for the idea that the world was created less than 10,000 years ago.   In other words, ""If Genesis-style creation were true, we would expect to see (fill in the blank)."""
5729,notsarc,"Actually, you gave (and misspelled) one of the common names given to the fossil, ""Turkana Boy"" It is also sometimes called ""Nariokotome Boy"". But the real designation of the fossil is KNM-WT 15000 and any knowledgeable discussion of that fossil will refer to it as such. That fact, by the way, is how I know that Turkana Boy and Nariokotome Boy are one and the same fossil."
5730,notsarc,I don't know if you ever heard of the UK Poll Tax but I could have seen myself protesting by non-payment against such a grotesquely unfair system of taxation had I been of the age to do so.
5731,notsarc,And so have animals. Plants have been wiped out in the great extinctions too.   [quote]Carbon dioxide producing animals could even feed themselves with their own breathe![/quot]   Huh? You produce carbon dioxide. How do you propose to feed yourself with that?
5732,notsarc,"And religious folk in the south used the Bible to justify enslavement of thousands or millions of blacks, and also to justify their treating blacks as mere property. I suppose (but am not familiar enough with all of the details to know for sure) that some even used the Bible to justify linching blacks."
5733,notsarc,There's a distinct difference... so what? No baby at any age can live outside the womb. It still needs care and attention like any other. This difference in age doesn't mean anything.
5734,notsarc,"Didn't supersport openly admit he could not prove his own beliefs in divine creation?   For all his dishonesty, you have to admit he's more honest and forthcoming then Marc or AA have been."
5735,notsarc,Is that not agnostic? You leave yourself open to change if evidence dictates it.   Sorry if this is just turning into word games.
5736,notsarc,"Technically, all syllogisms need two premises, first of all.   ""Step two"" and ""step three"" were a dilemma, not separate steps. Learn to read.   Dilemma:   You only read Scenario 1, which was:   step two -God can create a rock he cannot lift -   Step three - God cannot lift the rock   conclusion - God is not all powerful   Scenario Two was   - God cannot create such a rock   - Therefore, there is something God cannot do   - Therefore, God is not all-powerful   The only case in which God could truly be all-powerful is if he can somehow both create an unbreakable rock and then break it, which defies the Law of Non Contradiction and is thus absurd. Thus, the notion of all-powerfulness, which leads to such a notion, is also absurd."
5737,notsarc,"I think you need to look up euthanasia, and not only for the correct grammar. Those examples are not euthanasia. Abortion is not the same thing as euthanasia.   Why don't you just say what is on your mind, rather than setting these ham-handed traps you hope someone will fall into? It is clear what your opinion is. If you have something to say, by all means express yourself."
5738,notsarc,"Every relationship does entail moral obligations in one way or another, but the argument is that there is no relationship that morally obligates one to share ones body. They are trying to generalize 'moral obligations' as if that justifies anything. There are things that cannot be morally obligated, no matter the relationship, so the argument tries to prove."
5739,notsarc,"You mean, the perpetrator is convicted and the defender acquitted? Yes, that's the rule and not the exception. Notice here how no-one ended up dead, or even particularly seriously injured. Additionally the circumstances described are incredibly rare, that's why it makes the news."
5740,notsarc,"So sorry; I have a friend who works and lives in the D.C. area, but he has residency in Mass., because he owns a home there. And he was able to be married only because he owns a home there ?"
5741,notsarc,It varies. Sometimes elementary/middle school kids and sometimes older minors like high school kids. I not talking about gangbangers if this is where you're going.
5742,notsarc,Oh dear God your ignorance is abundant!   Do you not understand what the federal DOMA law does?
5743,notsarc,I say that you need to take into consideration the number of criminals that'll disregard the lock and try and break down the door anyway. That's why smart people don't rely exclusively on locks and security systems for their own protection.
5744,notsarc,"Proof that evolution is ""right"" is not necessary to prove that Genesis is not science. Genesis is an inspired poem, and contains truth in its message, but it is pretty obviously a work of poetry, like a song. Look at the repetition, and all the metaphors! Poetry does not imply fiction. THere are many historically valid poems. Plus, when read figuratively, Genesis poses no conflict at all with science.   Evolution is not the only science that demonstrates Genesis can not be read literally. What about the speed of light from the stars, geology, genetics, comparative embryology, etc. The only stumbling block between science and faith is a strictly literal interpretation. For most of us Faith and science work together!   see: songofgenesis.org for more detailed information."
5745,notsarc,"Actually, I don't have any respect for creationism in most of it's varied forms. I have had great respect for several individual creationists that I have met. But they earned that respect."
5746,notsarc,sinjin - I didn't mean to imply any linkage between your opinions and those of another poster. Apologies.
5747,notsarc,"But let me guess ... if they step down RIGHT after they find they will have to issue to gay couples, you'd be in favor of them being able to be sued for it, simply because the ""discrimination"" in such an event was toward gays? Right? At least if you are consistent with your stance elsewhere in regards to 'timing' ...   Anyway, aside from that inconsistency with your position elsewhere, I agree that county officials should need to comply. After all, there are probably OTHER examples whereby county officials have to do things that they are religiously against, such as issue divorce papers. Or marry some drunk couple that they know aren't really being serious even though they're tying the knot ... If all county officials could just refuse to do their job because of their objections--for WHATEVER reasons--it would be a collosal mess."
5748,notsarc,"Oh? Don't you think that since Jesus said that whosoever so much as hated their brother without a cause is a murder?   Or are you Jewish and don't believe the New Testament? Is that why you say the Bible says nothing about abortion, or just plain killing at all?"
5749,notsarc,"I got an interesting tid bit for you:   http://www.2ampd.net/Articles/difiElitist.htm   First read the text. The anti-gun senator is noted for having the ONLY legal concealed gun in the city of San Francisco.   Also note as a person who carried a concealed gun and still keeps a .357 magnum for protection, that she should KEEP YOUR FINGER OFF THE TRIGGER, until your aming at your target."
5750,notsarc,"Yes, the horror of voluntarily taking orders from someone in exchange for monetary rewards!!   If you hate your job that much, quit. You aren't being oppressed because someone offered you the option to do something. If you don't like it, don't do it. If you hate trade, you can go wander through the wilderness and eat berries and roots."
5751,notsarc,This makes more sense then anything else I've heard on this thread.
5752,notsarc,"To a small extent, this happens already. Oftentimes (21.3%, U.S.), a woman decides to have and abortion because she cannot afford a baby (from here, source). This is in effect removing members of society who are non-productive (babies produce virtually nothing useful until they mature by about 10 years). And poor families are less productive, since they are often on welfare.   Granted, this is a rather harsh perspective, but the effect is the same: In the U.S., there are about (21.3% X 1.31 million) 280,000 less people every year who would have likely grown up in a poor home (assuming the child wouldn't have been adopted). Forced contraception/abortion is seen as an effective way of solving poverty in some parts of the world..."
5753,notsarc,"I don't understand your question. If law-abiding gun owners were overwhelming those who should not have access to guns, those who use guns unlawfully, I would be very pleased.   But, as far as I can see, the only goal of the gunners is to make sure that everyone has a gun, no matter how insane, no matter how stupid, no matter how incapable they may be to own such easy-to-use instruments of death."
5754,notsarc,"No I don't think that tying your tubes is abortion. I only think abortion comes into play when there is actually cells forming to make a baby, and you get them scraped out, or abort a baby before or after the third trimester. Plus I heard that if you tie the tubes, when you decide you want a baby you can untie the tubes, to conceive a baby. But burning is another thing. But unless there is actual cells forming it is not abortion"
5755,notsarc,"And yet the atheist belief system allows for everyone to have their own seperate set of morals. According to the Atheist system, what Hitleror Stalin did was perfectly moral because those atheists believed that what they were doing was moral. Disgusting if you ask me."
5756,notsarc,"What is astounding about it? If we had been aborted, we wouldn't have known anything about it. Untold billions of conceptions have been spontaneously aborted. Do you shed tears for those, too?"
5757,notsarc,"Well, sort of. It isn't necessary, but if you're predicting intelligence from what someone does rather than direct measurements of physical properties, knowing their motivation level might allow you to make more accurate predictions.   Nevertheless even without knowing the subjects' motivations at all, today's generic intelligence tests still have excellent predictive power for success in both school and employment, and are perhaps better predictors for future success than any other method we have (including interviews, personality inventories, aptitude in a particular field)"
5758,notsarc,"Really? Intra-species evolution and inter-species evolution are one and the same?   *edit*   I was reading on micro-evolution in wikipedia, here is what they had to say...is this incorrect?   ""Typically, observable instances of evolution are examples of microevolution; for example, bacterial strains that have become resistant to antibiotics. Because microevolution can be observed directly, both pro-evolution and some anti-evolution groups agree that it is a fact of life."""

5761,notsarc,That and VOR keeps flip flopping on his positions and he refuses to clarify his contridictions.
5762,notsarc,Look up the evolution of colour vision in primates. It's my personal favourite - but what do you think?
5763,notsarc,"The Word of God says otherwise.   Romans 1:25-27 - They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creatorwho is forever praised...   Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.   You've rewritten Biblical Christianity. 2 Timothy 4:3-4 (New International Version) - For the time will come when they will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear."
5764,notsarc,"Yet this need for revenge is far removed from the need for justice. My original post addresses this feeling or need for the criminal to die. It has no relevance in the discussion of justice, only revenge."
5765,notsarc,"Zoos are indeed a good example. Although the environments are made as close as possible to the natural habitats, penguins are often kept in open-air enclosures in temperate or even tropical climates. And there are two critical differences in even the most carefully constructed zoo: the absence of any predators, and the absence of any prey. So why don't the animals quickly/purposefully/nonrandomly cease exhibiting developmentally costly traits which give them an advantage against predators or prey who aren't present?"
5766,notsarc,"First, I think you may have misunderstood the ""pro-life mantra"" seeing how many pro-lifers think it permissable to disconnect life-support systems in certain circumstances, which necessarily results in a person's death. But nevertheless, I think we agree that for purposes of the abortion discussion, it is a closer analogy to assume the violinst is only connected for nine months, and no longer than if we assume the violinist to be connected for some other arbitrary period of time. Am I correctly discerning an agreement on that?"
5767,notsarc,OK try the US Constitution. We are a representative democratic republic not a majority rule nation. Majorities hold certain powers but they are limited. Minorities continue to have rights which may not be infringed by the majority. Amibiguity and sharing of interests in various types of personal and social decisions is a necessary component of this system. We are built on compromise and that has served us well.
5768,notsarc,How many court decisions have said that it is unconstitutional to regulate guns in any way?

5776,notsarc,"Well it could mean simple instinct, and I think you will find it was only applied to animals with brains. EAM attributes ""intelligence"" even to bacteria and to corn plants, trees, jellyfish, single celled eukaryotes etc. If one is to consider intelligence the main driver of adaptation it must be omnipresent in living organisms - there is zero support for this concept."
5777,notsarc,"You don't consider yourself anymore advanced than animals? Not seperated specially in anyway? If humans are nothing but animals, than you have to question your own views and morals. For if we are just animals, than we have no cause or goals. You may as well kill yourself right now.   Please re-think this idea you have. I understand from your posts that you have a hard emotional problem, and I would urge you to please try and answer yourself those questions.

The stranger coming in and sitting down and using your plates and eating your food is a direct consequences of you inventing him in for dinner.   -If you say you don't want the unborn to ""live off you"" anymore then the only thing you can do is starve it because you can't kill it as it did nothing that it was not allowed to do until just now.   -You have decided the stranger must go, however, you don't have a right to kill him right there as you didn't give him any reasonable time to leave."
5785,notsarc,"As I mentioned above, science curriculums follow paths. One's worldview plays heavily on one's interpretation of scientific data. An agnostic, or atheist teaching establishment can become satisfied with one path of scientific theories without searching for others. There may be more to be discovered about thermodynamics, cell structure, irreducible complexity, the decay rate of the earth's magnetic field, radiometric dating, the fossil record, and countless other things that a teaching establishment may not be interested in exploring, if it's comfortable with it's interpretation of current data's indications that the happenstance origins worldview is correct. It goes back to what we touched on before - teaching students HOW to think, not WHAT to think."
5786,notsarc,According to Gallup about 8% of the U.S. population is atheist. Another poll by CUNY found that 7.7% of those polled responded that they had no religion.
5787,notsarc,"But people start threads here all the time against Christianity regardless of whether someone claims something here about it or not. It's prejudice, pure and simple, and you're no exception.

I mean, one would think those of you are do this sort of thing would be happy that someone had pointed out the obvious prejudice going on, as it would be a case to help you move away from prejudicial thinking."

5807,notsarc,"That clearly went whooshing over your head.   It was intended to mock the OP. (Interesting ""new"" bibilical revelation, indeed.)   I don't put any credence in silly comparisons like the trite Kennedy/Lincoln litany that arose in the 60's or the similarly absurd list that INRI posted. They both demonstrate how one can concoct meaningless comparisons in an attempt to invent a non-existent connection between two unrelated events.   It is the same for all ""prophesies""."

5810,notsarc,"I think they should. I mean, if you're under 18, you are still under your parent's guardian. I feel like they have the right to know if their child is getting an abortion."
5811,notsarc,What other theories? Why mention them if you aren't going to explain them? You are actually on a board of education? I notice there was no mention of telling kids that there are other theories of gravity and that all of them have holes. Evolution is a more secure theory than gravity.
5812,notsarc,"Oh sinj.don't let it get you down,it don't mean nothing   (sorry couldn't help it)"
5813,notsarc,Interesting thought..... such a situation would theorectically remove the division of opinion that exists based upon the perspective of gender (ie. the pro-life religious male) and would make any difference of opinion be based on moral/philosophical considerations alone.   You could argue it would shift opinion towards the mix currently held by women as everyone would be in the position of having to bear pregnancy. Given that there is a full mix of religious and other beliefs in the current day female population perhaps this would be a good analogy to such a state of being you suggest.
5814,notsarc,"After. Christian fundamentalism is somewhat recent. It arose as a backlash to discoveries being made in science in the 19th century. From one follower of a 7th Day Adventist prophetess came ""flood geology"" in the early 20th century. Later, in the renewal of interest in the adequate teaching of science in the U.S. in the 1960s, there arose more modern ""creation science."" It began by adopting the flood geology of the 7th Day Adventists as the base.   Creation science begins with the assertion the the creation stories, the flood story, even the mythology of Job and Jonah, are literally true. Creation scientists then attempt to distort the evidence to support this particular version of the Bible. When creationists realized that the biological evolution of species does occur, they decided that God had created original ""kinds"" and then allow hyper evolution after that. Creationists call hyperevolution variation in kind."
5815,notsarc,"Yet another alleged lie, by the Hillary-haters, shown not to be."
5816,notsarc,Uh...yeah? Is there some other way than evolution this can happen? Evolution encompasses speciation which results from evolution taking different paths when populations are separated by some factor in their environment or geographically.   Are you saying you believe that the species have all somehow resulted from a common genome yet at the same time rejecting evolution as an explanation?
5817,notsarc,"And certain versions of Mark:   15He said to them, Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation. 16Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. 17And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; 18they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well.   Are they mistakenly reading this?"
5818,notsarc,"Archie, instead of deciding before hand that I'm wrong, read what I'm saying. What trees were growing during this flood? I'm guessing there were no acorns sprouting into oaks during the flood. Therefore, in this flood sediment, we would find no rooted trees. We would find no burrows, and we would find no tracks.   Now we've seen you can't answer my question. Whether this is because you didn't understand it, or didn't want to consider it, I don't know. But there is no global flood sediment which meets the criteria neccessary to demonstrate a global flood."
5819,notsarc,So what? I don't care! Gun ownership is an individual right and that's the end of it! You don't have to exercise a right hundreds of thousands of times a year for it to be protected by the Constitution.
5820,notsarc,"Chuz, the purpose of this summary is not to summarise your arguments as a whole - it is to summarise what your argument is up to this point.   Why not post just a summary of your position so far, as you see it - I can do the same, then you can continue with your argument?   There's no point in writing an argument, summarising it and then leaving the thread before I've had a chance to respond to even your argument (never mind your summary). If you are going to simply ignore any criticisms of your reasoning, then I struggle to see the point of you repeatedly requesting a one-on-one debate in the first place - you essentially regress your argument to the 'because I said so' that you are (presumably) hoping to avoid, it's just that there's slightly more detail."

In the meantime murders will go through the roof, like in Australia, rape will escalate, breaking and entering will become common place, and cops will die by the minute. They will not only confiscate the guns, but then charge the owners of those guns for being terrorists. It won't end. In order to establish true dependency upon a government you must force the populous to rely completely on the government for every aspect of life including safety."

5829,notsarc,"Let's hear more. Remember; it is estimated that over 6 billion people were on earth at the time of the flood.   Also, Genesis 1 : 6 thru 1 : 10 - Water was above and below the firmament of Heaven. What happened to the waters that were above the firmament? Was this used for the deluge that covered the earth?   It had never rained before The Flood. Why, if someone made up this story, would they have said such a thing? Wouldn't it be much more believeable if they would have said, ""There had never been such a rain as this...""?"
5830,notsarc,Marriage is not a religious institution. It is a government contract nothing more. Many people choose to have a religious ceremony to celebrate their marriage but that doesnt make it a religious institution. Need proof? You can get married without the permission of the church but you cant get married without the permission of the government. And because marriage is a government institution then they cannot discriminate against same sex couples and must provide the same benefits to them as is provided to straight couples. And it cannot be a separate institution either because separate is not equal.   But as I have already said this shouldnt be up for a vote. Civil rights never should be.

Intelligent design lacks science as a whole as it is incapable of producing experiments to prove its assertions or provide geological evidence or even contemporary evidence that its claims are indeed valid.   Essentially Intelligent design is nothing more then Goddidit. Things are too complex to explain at the current moment, with the current understanding, therefore God was responsible.

5839,notsarc,"Scientically the data does account for those things. The numbers show that gay divorce is lower. Hetero couples could be separated, sleeping around, or other as well as the gay couples.

5845,notsarc,"That's true, as long as ones pursuit of science is really science. In the case of ""creation science,"" there is no science involved. As trebor has said, ""creation science"" is an attempt to find scientific sounding reasons that can be used to justify the conclusions that have already been reached and that are not subject to change.

It has been shown that criminals are less likely to break into a house whose owner has a gun.
5852,notsarc,"The thing is, though, that if marriage is privatized people can have freedom without ""redefining the standard."" It is a way for us to allow all those oddball marriages without putting an ""official stamp of approval"" on them.   Liberals want to expand the government involvement in marriage to include gay marriages, thus putting society's approval on these things (something that gets moralists very angry.)   Conservatives want to continue the statist rewards for straight marriage only - a violation of the 14th amendment.   Libertarians combine the best of both positions. Their position (privatization) creates the freedom to marry, upholds the Constitution, and avoids official approval of gay marriage at the same time."
5853,notsarc,"This is not the case, not exactly. The Constitution in the United States makes it clear that a citizen is born (or naturalized) and SCOTUS determined any reference to 'person' has never and was never intended to apply pre-natally.   If you mean morally... morals cannot be proven one way or another anyway.   Prove it.   Murder, by definition, must be illegal to be murder. Abortion is not illegal.   It is not a risk. You will be denying women. I think the fact of denying women choice in the matter is worse than the risk you speak of.   Disingenuous. You are ignoring the myriad of options open to a woman with a born child. In civilized society, with any amount of reasonable effort, a woman can find another to care for a born child. The morality is absolutely not comparable."

5855,notsarc,"Walking-fish:   This is a good response to IM2L844. I would say that Darwin's original argument from suboptimal design still holds as an argument against special creation, where each species is said to have been created de novo. But it doesn't rule out Intelligent Design, as an adjunct to evolution by natural selection. I agree that the argument from homology plus genetic evidence makes Intelligent Design less appealing. Of course, the bottom line is that there is plenty of evidence for natural selection (along with genetic drift, gene flow, and sexual selection) as a natural mechanism for evolution, and ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE FOR ID. This total lack of evidence for ID plus its failure to prove that natural selection could not have accounted for complexity in living organisms is really all that is needed to dismiss it at this point."

I remember a town I lived in where four murders happened in one week. Of course, the liberals scream ""*gasp*, four murders! Everybody's going insane! We gotta ban guns! Aaaahh!!"". However, none of these murders were committed with a firearm, and it was later found out that these killings were committed by one person. It's an isolated incident.

Flat EEG in the cerebral cortex means no brain activity in cerebral cortex means PVS. There is no reason to test a swallowing reflex, a pain response reflex, or sphincter tone.

Unemployment is High, we know this, but it was on it's way up when Obama took over because under Bush more corporations left this country , more businesses closed down, the Banks were allowed to do whatever they wanted without regulation of any kind, and yet none of it is his fault?..

You are very, very good at pretending that what your apponent says is invisible. Your repetition of the same fatuous inanity, (as always, phrased as evasive rhetorical questions instead of honest declarations of opinion), is nothing but a repetition of the objection I demolished in the very post you are quoting.
And here's another flash, socrates. The fact that some organisms die, for any number of reasons, sooner than some of their relatives do, explains exactly nothing. The insinuation that this survival differential has some universal, as opposed to local, efficient cause, is pure fecal matter. And that's all you've got, wiseguy. A simple fact of life, and an insinuated cause, and you think they add up to evolution. Breathtakingly simple-minded assumption, fella.

Matthew S. Stated that when people say ""We believe marriage is between a man and a woman."" think that gays are not citizens. I then returned a question saying ""if someone if 6 and can't marry are they going to 'not be citizens' as well?"". The logic behind that question is not to say that gays are 6 year olds but rather that gays are citizens just like a 6 yr old even if both can't marry. In other words, marriage doesn't make you a citizen or not...unless you think 6yr olds are citizens as well.

6323,sarc,"And you have been refuted time after time. Lies, damn lies and statistics is a starting point. Its the false idea of the more powerless you render yourself the safer you will be. I bet you strongly believe its possible to pick up a turd by the clean end."
6324,sarc,"Great job straight out of the leftard playbook. Can't refute the message so go after the messenger. Would it matter if it was printed in the NY Slimes, I doubt it."
6325,sarc,"I love this line. I assume by ""harm"" you mean an actual physical harm or some kind or another (physical in this case includes loss of items). So this would cut our laws in half. Walk around naked? No big deal! Have sex on the street why doing cocaine...go for it! Drunk in public? Who cares!   The list can go on forever."
6326,sarc,"If we were to debate whether God made us perfect as he could have, then of course we can make the point that he obviously doesn't exist."
6327,sarc,More labwork done on the back of a pink elephant.
6328,sarc,"Oh.. that makes sense. Because, it sounds exactly like modern day republicans."
6329,sarc,"Well if it's so easy then how about you provide the names of the dealers who're selling howitzers and anti-aircraft missiles and fragmentation grenades? And while you're at it, supply the names of the companies who're making them in violation of the various federal restrictions."
6330,sarc,"Yeah.. caught that... But, hey.. I think you made a mistake."
6331,sarc,"I don't have to say anything here, your post made it sound sick enough. Yes, freedaom at all cost. Isn't that the theory this country was founded by?"
6332,sarc,"And where, pray tell, does your un-'ignorant' system of proper behaviour come from?"
6333,sarc,And from where did you get this idea? Please provide your references.
6334,sarc,What is your theory about the foot fetish gene ?
6335,sarc,"So, it's a proven fact that children denied the act of abortion suffer negative effects? Hmmmmmm"
6336,sarc,"You should really think about what you say before you say it. I have heard this before and its garbish, I have been around and owned guns my whole life and I have never, not even once, had the thought of getting a gun just because someone ###### me off. I would never use a gun on a person unless that person were a viable threat to my life, such as coming at me with a knife for example."
6337,sarc,"So you are truthful, but I am a liar. Just like you are clever, but I am stupid. You have no respect for me, WW; I've never seen you demonstrate respect for anyone."
6338,sarc,"Actually yes, but not for the purposes of ilegal search or seisure, I have active duty military friends. They drop by all the time. Obviously your great lack of friends makes that idea hard to understand."
6339,sarc,Great way of twisting what I said. Would you like a Snickers bar?
6340,sarc,"I believe we have a human responsibility to one another. That we are our brother's keeper. Tell me, Bassman, if there aren't enough jobs, and the costs of medical care are skyrocketing through the roof, what do you suggest your fellow Americans do? Just drop dead?"
6341,sarc,"So you carry grenades and 75 pounds of gear, all while wearing camouflage fatigues and can call in an airstrike bombing?"
6342,sarc,"And would guns in the hands of citizens have stopped that? Or does publicity, which has only increased since those events, stop them? Your selective reading ability is at work."
6343,sarc,"So you're claiming that you ""transformed"" from part of your mother to a human. So you're claiming that you were once almost your mom's arm or leg? lol! Biologically, this is simply a farce statement."
6344,sarc,"So, if a baby is having trouble breathing that's been born already, you don't consider it a 'person'? Methinks you've not thought through the implications of your argument here at all."
6345,sarc,And creationism was investigated and explored completely and shown to be false.
6346,sarc,ROFLMAO! Nice way of restating the 'inaccurate' statement basically the same way.
6347,sarc,No but it will be funny to see what sex tapes this tramp did too....
6348,sarc,I see. So you actually reject all of science and still are willing to use a computer and the Internet. Don't you know that you are being led astray by your IBM processor?
6349,sarc,"Because the NY Times, CNN, ABC, Dan Rather, and Handgun Control are all atheist-lead and anti-Christianity. Yeah."
6350,sarc,"Of course God would have something to offer to lowely peon, but that doesn't explain what use God has for lowely peons, except for doing stupid pet tricks."
6351,sarc,you always run and hide behind Bryan like the true coward you are
6352,sarc,"You should watch where you cast stones, kido. Your original post is an example of a straw man...not mine. You should be more careful before operating a gun...you just yourself in the foot. LOL!"
6353,sarc,"You mental midgets insult my intelligence when you aren't even aware that the word omnibenevolent isn't even found in the Catholic Online - Catholic Encyclopedia . In fact, the word isn't found in any popular dictionary what so ever. It's an urban slang with no historical usage in theological studies or history at all. I ought to know, because it never came up in Bible College, ever. But here it is in the famous and highly referred to URBAN DICTIONARY: Urban Dictionary: omnibenevolent Once again guys, get a clue before you start spouting off your criticisms which you haven't an actual clue about."
6354,sarc,Ah the Pinhead element of the tinfoil hat brigade raises its pointy head.
6355,sarc,"And you, on the other hand, because you are not educated in science in general, and evolutionary theory (why the quotation marks?) specifically, are qualified to correct those of us who spent years in study of the topic."
6356,sarc,"As I have pointed out, the only BS here is your accusations."
6357,sarc,"I'd be curious if Berkowitz studied whether a sword or club produced the same effect as a firearm?   Short of castrating all boys at the onset of puberty, I'm afraid boys will be boys."
6358,sarc,"Yeah so what? I left the UK, I'm free now."
6359,sarc,"So scientists are doing science, lots of it. Check the August 2007 issue of Evolution, for example. On the other hand IDists produce nothing, do no lab work, but just harp and harangue against evolution. As the article says, ""Its passionate diatribes virtually advertise the program they attack. People must fight for something that they want to achieve, not simply reject an evil, however bad it may be. Shoe fits you lot, WW, not us."
6360,sarc,Could it partially be the fact that they don't want antiquated belief system dogma making their decisions? Must have access to a sonogram sounds like a lobby group attempting to sway opinion while enhancing revenue. Does the legislation force pregnant women who have not chosen abortion to have a sonogram? Raising children creates post-delivery stress syndrome.
6361,sarc,"Yes, the university one is quite possibly the most nonsensical. I will never understand why people seem to think that the mere presence of a weapon makes it somehow more likely that there is going to be a problem. I have lots and lots of guns, right here at my house. Last year, the murder rate at my house was 0. I think that we can most likely maintain the same this year.   What school are you at?"
6362,sarc,"Judicial activism? What brand of stupid is it that you use? What judicial activism do you see here; the judge stating that open carry is legal and has been, and that you can't be arrested when you haven't committed a crime? Or that the police can be sued for damages when they choose to break the law to persecute an innocent bystander?"
6363,sarc,These official groups are jokes. Armed citizens are much more effective.
6364,sarc,So then I guess you could also debate that algebra serves no purpose as well.
6365,sarc,And you know he is NATO's boy how? You get a bit more looney with each post there comic relief. Keep the laffs coming tho.
6366,sarc,This is a laughable oversimplication of reproduction. Humans don't make copies. Do you reproduce asexually? I know I don't.
6367,sarc,"Because we have different experiences than you and are more educated on the subject. The only ones who tend to ask ""Why do you feel you need a firearm to protect yourself"" are the ones who've never faced such a situation and don't know what it's like to be in such a position."
6368,sarc,"Here you are making an entirely unsooprted assumption, that I see myself as better than everybody else or that I am somehow smug in my views. I am no better or worse than most. We are all just the same tailess monkeys that walked out of the jungle so many millions of years ago. we are not particularly enlightenend, nor are we likely to become so."
6369,sarc,Make up your mind. Is it because of diet or is it because of evolution. It would be nice if you pick a horse and ride it.
6370,sarc,"so if right now, i ask god for forgivness, someone kills me, i will go to heaven by default? makes sense to me, i mean, i dont have time to sin..."
6371,sarc,If you dont believe that muslims love life they will cut your head right off! Its an easy choice if you ask me.
6372,sarc,So what? How long did the idea of magical creation out of nothing in 6 days hold prevelance before somebody actually challenged it scientifically?
6373,sarc,"No biggie, right? Typical creationist ""teach the controversy"" stuff. But wait! The ""encyclopedia"" follows this up with it's damning evidence to show the many holes in the ToE! Read on evolutionists, and despair!!"
6374,sarc,Seems all the drills would broadcast when they had a leftie. Just could wait for that case of M-1 thumb or the hot one down the shirt.
6375,sarc,"So, when a comedian leaves the stage and say's I killed tonight, then obviously killing people en-masse is just fine, right?"
6376,sarc,"Really? What book is that, because I have seen no quotes or links to any source of any info at all from you anywhere above on this page. So once again accipiter, what in the world are you referring to? You and the obvious child oughta get along fine since you both offer nothing more substantial than personal attacks which are based on your own warped beliefs and corrupted interpretations of that which you disagree with.   Here's my original post again, I challenge you to explain how these alleged stone age sheep herders whom you scoff at and mock described contemporary living creatures which paleontologists today identify as dinosaurs, from skeletal remains?"
6377,sarc,"The US is 3 trillion dollars in debt, abortion is not clear cut (just visit a debate), and you appear to be stereotyping democrats. Also, you may need to read the first ammendment again. For your answer to work, people would have to agree with you first, then they would understand (and agree with) you."
6378,sarc,"It depends. Do you feel the same way about the Yeti? How about the Lock Ness monster?   You can make the statement 'Based on the current available evidence, I do not believe in the existance of any god/gods.'   I think it is intellectual fence sitting myself. I feel the same way about God as i do about fairies, the yeti, alien abductions, and 'psychic powers'. There is no evidence that any of these exist, so based on the evidence, I don't believe they exist. Should new evidence be forthcoming, I will reevalutate my position based on that evidence."
6379,sarc,On the other hand abortion is only opposed by the born and wars are started only bu the born and choices are made etc etc etc etc.
6380,sarc,In the thousands of scientific papers that present the thousands of bits of evidence that go to prove evolution beyond all sensible sane and reasonable doubt.
6381,sarc,"I believe Alan Keyes already have used that term on us.   (Alan Keyes, the ultra-concervative Republican Candidate for the Illinois Senate seat - in opposition to Barack Obama. The Maryland resident the Republican party had to recruit because they couldn't find anyone else in their right mind who would go against Barack. Also the very same Maryland resident/Television talkshow host who beratted Hilary Clinton for moving to NY and expecting to be able to ""represent"" NY'ers. Yeah, look who's the hypocrit now.)"
6382,sarc,"Where are those organizations with such scientific rigor? If they truly do exist, they must be in the position to understand the God of the Gaps they're worshipping has become microscopic."
6383,sarc,"Oh my goodness, yes. I had forgotten that scenario. How silly of me."
6384,sarc,"How strange. It seems that Habbit's definition of the word definition is meaningless. Physicists and chemists can define what they mean by the word ""carbon,"" but according to Habbit that is just their opinion. According to Habbit, carbon can be a chocolate candy meant to be eaten in a car. That may be his opinion and he considers it as valid as specific definitions assigned to words used by experts in any given field."
6385,sarc,"Like I said, Catholic school. Or it could be that you're like 80 years old or something, because nowadays, if you talk about God or the Bible, then you don't get in trouble, you get criticized and made-fun-of, not only by your peers, but also by teachers."
6386,sarc,Deliberate deception would be putting million year old dinosaur bones on a thousand year old planet. Even more deceiving would be putting vast amounts of oil here as well which takes millions of years to create. I would put the stars in the sky in the same category as this in terms of deception. The stars could be more of a cosmetic thing as far as God is concerned. He could have just added them to our sky without concern for whether it made sense or not. I personally wouldn't fault him for this.
6387,sarc,"Well then. All of the ex-christians have it both ways don't they. Since they are saved they can lie, cheat, steal and have wild, illicit sex (following the example of several christian preachers)."
6388,sarc,That is the only purpose it was created for. One must wonder if BS can have several uses to man and ID has but one which is the more valuable?
6389,sarc,"But religion is not a topic for science classes. Teach the science in class and if that presents a problem for your religion at home, perhaps you should think about your religion a bit more critically and realistically. What is being attempted is to cast doubt on well established scientific theory and pretend that magic is a viable alternative."
6390,sarc,Well bravo for you - they must not be all that good considering. Or did you simply learn to be deceptive yourself and confuse that with deception by others? Who can say?
6391,sarc,How about this explanation - you're reading WAAAAAY too much into your precious Bible.
6392,sarc,"Thank God you have that unfortunate government. It permits you the opportunity to decide on how justice is defined and how it may best be served for all of us.   In a perfect world these types of choices would not be necessary, but then in a perfect world there would be no purpose for religion. We do the best we can in proportion to how much we care. Want a different government vote. Want a better government vote wisely. Want a better government quickly. Get others to do the same."
6393,sarc,"Actually, breeding horses and donkeys isn't an effort to create a new species. Where did you get such a thoughtless idea. And neither is interbreeding lions and tigers. However, you don't seem to be aware that neither ligers or tigons are sterile. They are capable of breeding with each other or with either of the parent species. And then there are polar bears and brown bears, which can and will interbreed if given the opportunity. And the offspring are perfectly fertile."
6394,sarc,"wow....there is a real person under there. Good luck on your recovery, chemist."
6395,sarc,"Because all scientists hate god. Again, this is a fact."
6396,sarc,Using Bush as a 180 compass is just fine by me.
6397,sarc,"That's quite a leap, even for you. How did you know that the officiers were pro-life? Or that any pro-life people would condone the officiers' behavior in this instance.   I certainly think it was excessive. I guess I must not be pro-life by your illogic."
6398,sarc,"...? Either you've misread what I said, twisted what I said, or you're just stupid."
6399,sarc,Chill on the name calling. it only weakens your position in a debate. If you want to prove a point do so with logic and evidence. Leave the name calling to 5 year olds!
6400,sarc,When's the last time you heard of someone being killed by the accidental discharge of a fire extinguisher? Or when the last time a fire extinguisher was stolen from a home and then used in the commission of a crime? And don't you think the likelihood of being in a car accident is greater than that of being required to shoot someone?
6401,sarc,I won't waste my time with trolls here. Do you have anything useful to say?
6402,sarc,"You must be thinking of physics... last I looked, biologists weren't trying to explain the the creation of the universe. However, we have an excellent handle on the evolution of species, and some pretty reasonable ideas about the origin of life, which is more than your bible ever came up with. I mean... some invisible, bearded guy-in-the-sky zapped it all into existence? Fairytales."
6403,sarc,"Actually, isn't it creationists who claim that the universe was created from nothing? Creationists even have a magazine formally called ""Ex Nihilo"" (changed to ""Creation"" because creationists didn't know what it meant.)"
6404,sarc,And then you can go pat yourself on the back and pretend it's all better. I hope your personal comfort level will be worth the havoc that will be brought upon the lives of women.
6405,sarc,"Which is why 50 million Americans are uninsured, including 9 million children. With 27,000 from that group dying every year, as a result of ""freedom"", and unpaid hospital bills the leading cause of bankruptcy and homelessness. Also for the other 50 million who are underinsured."
6406,sarc,Again I have to correct you. Dark moths were not observed before 1848. Similar mutations have been observed in other species of moths both in Europe and in the United States. Merely claiming that there was no change is ducking the question. You didn't bother to inform yourself of the facts and now you return to your incorrect assertion again and again after having been informed of your error.
6407,sarc,"Quote Mining. You got to love it. Always fascinating when stuff is dishonestly taken out of context. Normally, we see this from creationists, but you are by no means the first prolifer who has engaged in this practice. But lets look at it"
6408,sarc,So I pray to chance every night before I go to bed?
6409,sarc,"Well, you must not be a GOP lawmaker or the President of the United States. They're convinced that the only way to prevent the SCOTUS finding in favor of same-sex marriage is to amend the Constitution."
6410,sarc,"Funny how people who are ""for"" capital punishment don't see it that way..."
6411,sarc,You mean the truth of thousands of young teen girls dead with a coat hanger in hand? Abortion is a neccessity so that it can be regulated. People will have abortions legal or not legal. At least provide a safety net other than a coat hanger.
6412,sarc,"So you're saying that God is a ""respector""?-of-persons - iow, the mom's ""more""-important to *God*? than the unborn."
6413,sarc,No I can't marry them becasue some of them are married. Also none have intent to li ve within Mass.
6414,sarc,Just as you and your favorite group are master manipulators of emotion amongst the uneducated. Yes we do need to pay attention to the great danger you and your ilk pose. We need to shine the light of truth on your lies and expose them.
6415,sarc,"Really? Wow, I didn't know that books with their edjumacational benefits..."
6416,sarc,"Oh yes, Mr Behe makes a comfortable living out of selling to the ignorant. His newest book is just a rehash of his old book, and has the very same flaws that have been destroyed over and over again. As for your 'religious authors' being respected.. they are respected perhaps by the fundamentalists that do not understand what science is about."
6417,sarc,"What, you mean like this story (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3136266.stm) of scientists warning about ocian acidity levels from 2003? Global warming is old news too: it doesn't seem to have reached the more remote parts of the world though, like North America for example."
6418,sarc,OH FREE MARKET???? IM goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6419,sarc,"You are apparently unwilling to extend your thinking process to the other side of the argument Galileo, and by this I mean, and repeat that it isn't criminals owning hand guns which we defenders of gun rights are fighting for. WE AGREE THAT CRIMINALS SHOULDN'T BE ARMED, and the laws already exist on the books to punish them when convicted criminals are caught with guns. But your solution to disarm all honest citizens in the belief that this will make them unavailable to criminals also is ludicrous to the point of self destructive insanity. It is that premise which we are fighting against through the NRA and other lobbying efforts."
6420,sarc,"April was ""recent"" ? Please provide evidence from the memo of these ""examples""."
6421,sarc,Come back when you learn the difference between climate and weather.
6422,sarc,"Just because you don't hold the same beliefs as we do, does not invalidate our belief. I feel sorry for you if all you have to believe in is a small petri dish of algae. You do need absolute proof if your going claim it as the only possible way of creation."
6423,sarc,"More irrational drivel, and have you forgotten that I am an arab? A smaller minority in this country than blacks? Yet you must play the race card and assume that because I oppose this criminal woman for threatening the life of her unborn child by actually holding her responsible for her own poor conduct that I am somehow a racist. Your argument is as pathetic as your character is found wanting, you immoral apologist for all that is wrong with this country."
6424,sarc,Don't forget Ted Kennedy. My question is what kind of machine guns his body guards have? MP5s or UZIs
6425,sarc,"Your knowledge of history is frightening. We saw how well Sarbane-Oxley, the most far-reaching intrusion into corporate America since FDR, prevented our recent crash. A crash that was precipitated by Clinton's edict to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to loosen up the purse strings so deadbeats could get mortgages."
6426,sarc,But surely it's ok to vote for a man who starts an unjustified war that results in the deaths of hundreds of thousands...right?
6427,sarc,"Yep, suppressing natural behavior is always the way to go. We should also get them to stop pooping."
6428,sarc,"And without a limited lifespan there would be no death. But we don't live in such a world, so shut up and get onto a more relevant topic."
6429,sarc,I think maybe you have hit yourself in the head with the Bible a few times too often.
6430,sarc,"how about a Swiss University? they have full automatic weapons in most homes, and target shooting is a national sport."
6431,sarc,"Well, I suppose creationists would object to careful definition of terms and the assiduous distinguishing of fact from non-fact, wouldn't they? It runs counter to all they hold dear."
6432,sarc,So how are those gun free zones working out for you?
6433,sarc,So you are saying that we determine our DNA? Do you actually think before typing?
6434,sarc,"And you offer none for your's. Heteros engage is risky business as well. Therefore on the same grounds we ban straight marriage.   It's not just STD's, it's all sorts of physical issues as well. Cancers, hepatitus, bacterial infections, that result from anal and vagina sex. Add one word and BAM, it works aganist you."
6435,sarc,"What's your point? Unicorns breathe toxic gas and have low density, so they can get around all they want."
6436,sarc,"So your answer to the question then is ""Nothing"", Marc?"
6437,sarc,Well lets speculate about how many possible explanations we could concoct if left to supposition. I'm talking about the only two explanations for the origins of life that have ever been entertained as viable empirically testable concepts in modern science.
6438,sarc,"And so wasn't the universal opinion that homosexuality is unnatural, wrong and to no benefit to Society at all."
6439,sarc,"Are you sure? VOR is a 14 year old kid from Florida. His IP is squarely from a ISP from Florida. If he is retired, he is the first person I have ever heard who was 60+ that used slang normally reserved for street gangs. Not to mention that his war stories place him in two different seas at the same time. Somehow 2 tours turned into 4, midlevel ship officer turned into high ranking military advisor.   All in all, VOR is far more of a liability to any of his allies because of his lying, lack of education and reading comphrension problems."
6440,sarc,"Oh no. The main disagreement between theistic evolutionists and Fundmentalists is that Fundies aren't worshipping God, but a false idol of their own making."
6441,sarc,You mean you equate the Bible with your own theory?(which is lacking information).
6442,sarc,"Well then, using just the Bible, what is the value of pi to the third decimal point?"
6443,sarc,And how do you know what other animals can analyze? Is that another supreme abilities of us humans? To read the minds of animals?
6444,sarc,It appears the safety Nazis feel gun free zones should be ran like prisons. Maybe the safety Nazis should take a field trip to their states prison system and ask the guards if guns or any other weapons ever make it into the prisons. Prisons are considered gun and drug free zones. If this was true then how can an inmate get shot by a gun in prison?
6445,sarc,"But on the other hand, Genesis isn't a scientific document. No wonder. Why would a bronze age nomad from the Levant be aware of at least 3 tailless species of primates, or even the tailed primates from Africa, South America, and even Madigascar. If they aren't mentioned in the Bible, do they exist?"
6446,sarc,Who but a creationist would ever make such a laughable claim?
6447,sarc,"Proof is a matter of math and booze. So, if you agree with Ursus maritimus, do you agree with me?"
6448,sarc,"Crammed with them, sure, why not? It's easy, only a few million light years. The scientific method is used in weather forecasting too."
6449,sarc,Link me to one saying weed 'addiction' is worse than alcoholism please.
6450,sarc,"This is not to say that every current dictionary includes such a definition... yet... but a number of major on-line ones demonstrably do, and to my knowledge human civilization has yet to suffer any negative effects.   (By the way, the above entries also include the typical ""husband and wife"" kind of arrangement as well. Funny how words can have more than one meaning, isn't it?)"
6451,sarc,"Via something called ""evidence"". It is something that a creationist will never have come across, thus explaining why you are unaware of it."
6452,sarc,"Oh so I take it the drug dealer was a law abiding citizen who had obtained his firearm legally and used the shotgun in self defence? I though not. Just out of personal interest lets say you took away the rights of the law abiding to own guns how would that shooting be stopped, cus i am pretty sure the drug dealing criminal would still get his gun Illegally.   A gunner you say went on a massacre? I am pretty sure you mean a criminal went on a massacre and maybe if somebody like Doc or Old sarge was there the end death tally would have been alot different."
6453,sarc,So penfold and brady you are in favour of denying citizens rights even though they have not been proved to have commited any crime? Ed Kennerdy was on that list so should he be discriminated against even though he has commited NO crime? What is next putting black people on the list purely because of the colour of their skin?   You sicken me you two. Why on gods earth would terrorists be buying civilian guns when they could just use AK47? Did you sniff petrol as a youngster as you seem to have.
6454,sarc,"Just can't satisify ""them thar' Moralizers."" I remember the election of 1960, and how many were worried about JFK taking his ""orders from Rome."" Maybe that is why we are a land of laws, not of men."
6455,sarc,"What makes you think I don't. Yours is not the only religion on earth!! And I didn't just jump to the concluision that your soul needed concern, so don't jump to it with me."
6456,sarc,"You are just playing dumb, right? There will be fewer technicians and fewer orders for equipment PER INSURED. Their pay will not be cut. There will be fewer of them PER INSURED. Initially the absolute volume will increase."
6457,sarc,And I suppose you feel it would've been better if she died at the hands of a knife-wielding killer?
6458,sarc,Oh - so you don't want to force me through pregnancy at any cost to me? You will let me make what decision is best for me? You will actually realize that I am in the best position to know?
6459,sarc,Why? You'll just call them 'stupid'. And by doing so you will have effectively trumped all of the facts in one fell swoop. Right?
6460,sarc,Of course. What a stupid question! The Gods can do what they damned well please.
6461,sarc,So conservatives can give shout their brand of lies as the truth but a liberal who calls them on it isn't being tolerant?
6462,sarc,i have a 2 years old child. i have come to believe i am unfit as a parent. i plan to kill this child at next available opportunity.

Clearly you're the one who's arrogant, if you can make these kinds of baseless generalizations of your opponents. Isn't it you who always accuses conservatives of being intolerant of people who think differently than them? Now that's irony!"

Do you think that there were a pair of each species, or just a pair of each ""Biblical Type"" and could you define what is meant by that term?   Would that include all beetles/insects/arthropods/invertebrates or just anything you felt was convenient?"
6480,sarc,So if Utah made a law or a governor stated that christians didn't need protection because of their beliefs even if there were incidents of anti chrisitan beating and harassment let alone murder for their beliefs you would just say let states have their own laws?
6481,sarc,"So it's not safe to go to school because your teacher might kill you if you're late at turning in your homework?   Incidents such as the shooter professor are incredibly rare; you'll find very few school teachers that were convicted of murder during a previous date, and released from prison due to a favor from a politician.   But incidents like the one in the UK, where the aggressor is in less trouble than their intended victim, are far more common and close to the norm for the country. If you're attacked, you're guilty if you fight back and cause either harm or fear to the person attacking you. Even if they assault you with a deadly weapon, you're the guilty party if you manage to cause them any sort of harm."

6485,sarc,"So why is this killing in DC on the news, when so many previous ones were ignored and treated like they didn't exist?   Didn't the report say the police recovered a so called ""assault rifle"" from the suspects? Something that's supposed to be banned under current DC laws? Aren't magazines above 10 rounds also banned? How'd this killing happen if these two features are completely banned within DC and not available to anyone there?"
6486,sarc,"So you're kind of like a crimelord who claims to be a pacifist because he has thugs on the payroll who do the dirty work for him?   ""Ah well you see, my personal morality prohibits violence, but that doesn't inhibit me from financing, applauding and demanding violence be done on my behalf whenever it suits me. You see, as long as my hands don't directly commit the violence, I am pure as snow"".   In other words, you're discussing when government should use violence. Which according to you, is a lot of the time. Especially should someone dare to defend themselves against a home invader.   You really don't see the hypocrisy in condemning someone for violence and simultaneously calling for more violence, do you?"

6509,sarc,"You haven't posted a challenge yet. Including this post.   Would I fit the bill?   Sure, but about what? What's your resolution?   For instance, you might say ""Resolved: Creation and Evolution are equally valid interpretations of empirical evidence"".   Now, personally I'd say that's still too vague because 'creation' drags in all kinds of issues that evolution doesn't speak to (eg abiogenesis, cosmology etc), and 'evolution' could mean common descent, the theory of evolution, etc etc.   So we might kick the idea around for a bit and narrow it down to ""Resolved: Hypotheses of special creation of species and common descent are equally well supported by empirical evidence"".   Or, perhaps it's the age of the earth you want to focus on: ""Resolved: all available evidence is consistent with a 6-10,000 year old earth""   I can't do this for you, feindslayer; make up your mind and present a proper challenge."

We can advertise each killing (hanging, rock slaying, Guillotine, etc.) weeks in advance, kinda like moves, and show it on pay-per-view. You can buy tickets to watch the show live as well. I mean c'mon, if we're going to have the death penalty we might as well utilize in the most gruesome, cost efficient, and swift method possible. Right? That is how punishment was executed a few centuries ago.   Honestly, how you feel is how a lot of people culturally conceive such offenders.

3,notsarc,"Well, if Genesis was in fact true, then we would have to assume that God is real and the Bible more or less explains what he wants, right? And if there is someone ""up there"" who will damn you to eternal torment if you don't do what he wants (which is one interpretation of the Bible) than that might effect the way you act. I realize that that isn't exactly the same as changing your moral compass, but history has demonstrated that most people's moral will stretch to accomodate pressing needs, and I think an actual vengeful diety would qualify. "
4,notsarc,"Just making sure that everybody is aware of his evasion, misrepresentation, and dishonesty. I figured a good time to do that would be while he was accusing scientists of these things... (I figure it's a damn good illustration when a paper's author tells him to stop misrepresenting the paper, and he keeps doing it anyway.)In fairness, being a creationist isn't necessarily an indicator of dishonesty; there are plenty of creationists who are creationists simply because they are uneducated about the subject. Unfortunately, supersport isn't part of this group; he has seen the evidence and is willfully ignorant of it. "
5,notsarc,"That's is ridiculously poor logic. Simply becuase the church makes mistakes doesn't mean it's incorrect in all other charges. The US government is WAY more corrupt than the Catholic Church, and yet we obey every god-damned thing big brother makes us do. "
6,notsarc,"Well, many have argued that if you don't except a literal Genesis, you're damned. Perhaps not in this particular thread, but the arguments are esentially the same. I believe that the theological implications of that position are fair game for discussing the validity of creationism. "

10,notsarc,"his lies, his media darling status, my post above answers your question for you."
11,notsarc,"you're a darling, j. coulda used you here earlier, though, to straighten this mess out. as far as 'stalking' goes, btw, my first appearance here was 11/08/94 (the same day i told those on the ny times board about this forum. ) the poster in question (infamous on the same board, though he pretends not to be) first appeared on 11/16/04. who's stalking whom?"
12,notsarc,"darling, it isn't an analogy at all. as duo correctly observed, it is a counter. when faced with a choice between human life and animal life, one should not automatically choose the human. why is abortion worse than eating bacon and eggs? because we like babies more. not because human life is worth more, or more valuable in any way, just because we like babies more.  personally, when faced with the choice of buying dog food or sponsoring a child in africa, i choose to feed my dog. because i like my dog more than i like people i don't know."

14,notsarc,"that's just darling, and all. but it still doesn't indicate that a fetus is a small person. no one denies it's alive. no one denies it is of the species homo sapiens. no one denies that an embryo can ultimately become as person, which is the simplistic point of that cloying article. it is personhood of the fetus that is the debate. i don't think it can ever be definitively determined.  using dr. seuss was an excellent choice of reference to back your argument, however. i am not sure why you quoted shooter's post about a death sentence. however, if you really equate abortion with murder, are you willing to advocate charging the mother and doctor with premeditated murder?"

42,notsarc,"that's not because of something i did. that's because of something that happened back in the 1950s, i believe. that's fine--go ahead and be offensive! it will only hamper your efforts because it only makes people angry at you when you belittle things they hold dear. but what about religious people that aren't out to do that to you and your family? if the govt. endorses a religion, remove the endorsement! that's fine. you're still willing to be offensive to all religious people because of fundamentalists (which are really the ones doing what you describe!). you can be as offensive and show as much lack of respect as you want. it's only going to make it harder on you to convince people."
43,notsarc,"hello there, my dear fellow, you're using a 19th century definition for a 21st century subject. it doesn't work. what you're writing is pure drivel. there is the caucasian group which you initially mention, then you misuse the terminology, actually meaning the sub-ethnicities of the caucasians. no doubt you're one of those sadly misinformed individuals who believes that 'muslim' is a race. the state of education is surely at an all time low-and getting lower no doubt. cheers from the rockies emoticonxkill emoticonxhoho emoticonxcry emoticonxkill"

46,notsarc,"100% because it's programmed to do that. note that when you pick a color for your number, you have narrowed the programs choices to five. note the groupings of the like colored numbers and you will see that when you get ready to pick your house that each of the numbers in your color range has been placed in a different house. (this applies to all color groupings. they've also added numbers 26 thru 30 which do not appear in the original array.) when you pick your house (if your honest about it) the program knows your number. it then displays that number behind the first door that you click on, regardless of which one of the three doors you choose. elementary, my dear watson! some people just hate to see christians having fun?"

50,notsarc,and i strongly dispute that albert einstein was a bundle of emotions too. who says he didn't have emotions?? it is just that he is not a bundle of it. and also i think music is a bundle of emotions and not man. because music generates emotions and it is not wrong that dear mr. alberto was a music lover but that doesn't mean he is a bundle of emotions!!!!!!!!!!

54,notsarc,"the rights of the collective must not take away the rights of the individual. how would you like your private choices to be dictated by other people? freedom is a right, even for you. i would defend to the death your right do whatever as long as you don't violate other people's rights, and i want the same in return. if we take away individual liberty, society as a whole dies away because the individual has no voice, no recourse, no means of obtaining freedom, and that my dear is not the type of society that i am willing to live in. all due respect to you of course."
55,notsarc,"firstly, my dear opponent is not well informed. because all public houses have there medical workers. and if there 'worker' is infected they do not let him work at their public house and that checking is held twice a month. so that's infecting is impossible. never the less honor is the most important thing for girls in kazakh families. ans having such kind of relations for her is unforgivable i think. i think that all people do not satisfied in lower salary. and kazakh people will want to take higher places in their working place. and have career growth. and so they may as managers and gain skills by them self while people from africa will do all 'dirty' work."

58,notsarc,"dear terry here, please see my post on the other side of this debate. you may think that nothing happens after you argue a debate, but that is just the start. so much more happens after a debate is created and argued. people around the world look at the debates and learn from them, make decisions because of them and create additional debates. your input can change the world. andy"

80,notsarc,"evolution (allele frequency changes in populations of organisms) is a fact, because it has been observed. the theory of evolution (how various allele propagate through a species) is just that: a theory.  to sound horribly wishy washy, yes it can be both ways. evolution and the theory of evolution are two different things. as far as new organs being produced over time... well organs don't really fossilize, however why can't the fossil record be used to show that organisms change over time? and as far as minor mutations, that has been clearly observed in the lab and in the field.  http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releas...-dtm031902.php http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/speciation.html and of course... the infamous peppered moths..."

84,notsarc,thank you. i discussed with a friend earlier that some moron would take the bait and waste their own time by saying what you just said. it is fantastic as my friend said nobody would be so stupid to waste their time commenting about their disagreement of the debate.
85,notsarc,obama has 1 thing that palin certainly doesn't have is the fantastic ability to turn crowds in favor of him. obama has amazing speech abilities that surpasses palin without a doubt in my mind. palin also likes to go off subject almost as if she is avoiding certain questions.  what is experience if you cannot even thoroughly explain your position?
86,notsarc,"wikipedia is really quite amazing actually. you see the fact that anybody can modify it as a reason to not trust it. that would be a valid concern if it had only a small number of contributors. but, there are millions of contributors. each going over and correcting information supplied by others. in my mind (given the current number of users) wikipedia is a fantastic peer-reviewed source of information."
87,notsarc,"wow that is a fantastic analogy, i love it. and in my personal opinion i do have to say i agree with you."
88,notsarc,it wasn't the best movie ever mind you but it was still fantastic.
89,notsarc,"the 2012 ndaa reiterated the nuaf document from 2001 and also later stated that it must abide the constitution, so it's nothing new. one thing obama, bush, and all other presidents have and will do, is start shit with other countries. yeah it sucks but it's beyond our control, literally and practically. the guy is the commander-in-chief, thereby a war mongering assmite, but nevertheless, his social policies are fantastic. lgbt rights and gay rights, women's rights, i'm down for that. the increase in debt, yeah it's his fault, but whatthefuck would you do? there's no money to be had, and in order to still function, the u.s. needs money. i believe we were beyond the debt horizon years ago, in that we basically have been bought wholesale by china, and this debt is just their mortgage."

94,notsarc,"i feel the opposite is true. i feel a lack of hierarchy adds complication to the layout. it's pretty functional don't get me wrong. freaking cool site, but i mean you have all this opportunity to explore hierarchy and color (brand = two colors, blue/orange, arguments has 2 choices...). they even dabbled in it a little with the 'add argument' buttons above. the grid structure of the layout seems mildly confusing as well. for instance, the vertical alignments of usernames with their respective arguments could match up more uniquely to aid in clarity. or if the leading (space between lines of text) wasn't so consistent, each 'argument' might be better framed visually, without the addition of graphics or color. obviously, this is not gospel or some fantastic soultion, i just think lack of color could be one of a few ideas on improving clarity and functionality of the site."

97,notsarc,"100x better? that's a lot. it doesn't bother me that dalai lama is human. people love gandhi, and that guy let his wife die because he didn't believe in medicine. then a few days later when gandhi ended up getting sick with the same illness, he accepted the medicine. so he was a bit of a dick, but he was also a little bit brilliant. both the dalai lama and gandhi teach some fantastic messages, and even though they aren't perfect themselves, that doesn't mean some of their messages aren't worthwhile."
98,notsarc,"why not invite a bunch of famous people? de niro is an incredibly interesting guy; my brother used to work on many films with him as a lighting specialist. he was one of the few folks that actually got to know him. scorsese, on the other hand, i'm sure, like you said, has tons of stories and anecdotes, all of which i'd love to hear! i've got my fair share of intellectual, spiritually magnificent people: ghandi, nietzsche and morello are all fantastic people."
99,notsarc,"i would suggest trying out new activities/hobbies she might enjoy. at her age, gymnastics is a fantastic activity, which gets her comfortable with moving her body in different ways and would set her up for a healthy, active lifestyle later on. dance is also fun for children at her age. above all, if she's not already part of one, i would suggest putting her in a preschool program (not a daycare) so she can be around other children her age and learn the fundamentals that will set her up for academic success."
100,notsarc,"this is true but maybe i have add when it comes to reading about something i already know, the book has always been better than the movie to me if i see the movie prior to the book it upsets me already. what i hate the most and i mean absolutely despise is when i see a fantastic movie that is based off of a book. if i haven't read the book i feel like slapping myself in the face for not doing so! to me i just am unable ( really ) to read the book when i know what happens in visual detail ="",20,that's interesting because you are certain to miss something that may just intrigue you in reading the book. a movie is rarely absolute but the book always is.  3_38125,5,fantastic,oh so true. not funny. not to me anyway. it was put together well"

102,notsarc,"yes they both rock,but the main things is what you're looking for. if your looking for romance,emotion,etc, that type then ya the twilight saga books are great. on the other hand,if you want to enter a world of fantisy,magic,action,etc,then the harry potter series kills anything. the movies of these two are good but not nearly as fantastic as their books. :)"

104,notsarc,"So according to one of the people who conducted the study don't go using their results as a tool for arguing against abortion.One woman I know had an abortion a short time after she was married. I also know she has regrets that she had the procedure. I considered what she had to say about her experience and thought about the 14 year old son she now has. From what she told me, I could plainly see she would never have had her son if she had not had her abortion as her circumstances would have changed beyond recognition. Perhaps she gets depressed about the child she never had because of her abortion. However, her son is a fantastic boy whom she loves very much. So we cannot simplify in quite the way you seem to infer that we can. "
105,notsarc,"This does not mean that the column is fantastic nor imaginative. It may very well be that not all areas of the earth accumulated all types of rock that form the column; this does not mean that the years at which similar columns were deposited in different places in the world are not similar. And of course, even if the Geologic column is not true, this provides no evidence of creationism. "
106,notsarc,"fine. thank you.  what im hearing is that you believe attila should act in accordance with the prevailing moral consensus. how do you define the moral consensus? in attilas case, would that be among the huns? among the hun ruling elite? or should attila act in accordance with a wider consensus of which he (for the sake of argument) has no intimate knowledge?  now why should he act in accordance with the consensus?  this is not completely clear to me. so, do you take the position that moral sentiments are learned?"
107,notsarc,"lol, what did you mean by that? i'm not sure, and dont want to assume the tone you infer with. i thought it was funny but wanted to clarify. ps; i have never called anyone a 'fetus worshiper', although at least that label does not elicit the same evil connotations 'pr-abortion does'. @ simone, no worries hun :)"
108,notsarc,"hun dont let no ones opinions bother you. no one matters but you, because your living your life and its your body. i personally think everyone shold hold off till 16 but im not going to insult you because thats just plain retarded. what gives you people the right to insult someone for asking a question? im not talking about freedom of speech im talking about being a nice person. nobody has manners anymore, i swear."
109,notsarc,"i recommend that gay people stay out of and move out of the state of virginia. thanks to pat the nazi robertson and jerry the hun falwel virginia has become the most hostile in the country towards gay and lesbians. no contract, including wills, powers or attorney, and even the joint purchase of a house, may be made by people of the same sex. this is one of the most evil laws that has been passed and will be used against the surviving spouses of gay people by evil christianist realetives to invalidate wills and powers of attorney's for god's sake stay out of the evil state of virginia"
110,notsarc,"please direct me to this quote. i have his book, the reformation, and he makes it quite clear the numbers are at 2-3 thousand, though some people in the 1700's said it was over 100 thousand, which was impossible. you seem a bit ignorant about the church, let alone the encyclopedia approved by it. the church has a long history of keeping very detailed and very accurate articles. to say that the church's approval is not worth anything is to say attila the hun never went to rome (or italy), that charlamange never existed, and that many of the popes didn't exist.  the savage europeans wern't conquering the americas, so they didn't need to be civilized, as i've already made quite clear. the savage europeans were people like the vikings, not people like the english or french."
111,notsarc,"i am not arguing that business decreases, i am saying that it is not as bad as you make it sound. i'm a bit surprised... you would prefer those small businesses to companies that give billions of dollars to charities?"
112,notsarc,xd i wouldn't be surprised. i'm actually surprised that the kkk are still allowed to remain active. that's one the downsides to freedom of speech i guess.
113,notsarc,"i'm a little surprised by this. the polls i've seen show that mass voters favor gay marriage. i would have thought that getting those who oppose it to put their opposition on the record before the elections would be beneficial. then again, seeing as how the lies and fear mongering have already started, i can see how they might want to avoid having the elections muddied with the inevitable dirty fighting that would be thrown at them. not the most couragous stance, but perhaps safer in the long run. you are right that the longer society fails to collapse the more inane the doomsayers seem."
114,notsarc,"i'm a little surprised- i've found that pot smokers are usually the least pushy. usually they're laid back enough to just offer, unless they forget to offer. i've only ever been pressured to drink by one person, and that's all the peer pressure i've received. i'm not sure if it's the people i hang with, who almost all use something but are very laid back, or if it's that i'd be hard to ressure so that people don't try. what's your experience been?"

116,notsarc,"great choice. you may remember her from the beethoven movies, she played the mother in part 3. i've seen that film at least a dozen times and i like it more with each viewing.  yeah i know what you mean, but i can't help watching sometimes,lol.. i treat it like taking a trip to the candy store, i'm always surprised at how much research some of these atheists will do to debunk god..."
117,notsarc,"i'm always surprised by these numbers. i mean, i know we live in countries with distinct christian majorities, but nonetheless, the high numbers in these polls always catch me a little off guard. it would seem to me that there is a larger population of non-christians, as well as those who fall into the atheist/agnostic camp, than these polls generally present. i guess i could be completely wrong though. i think it's in part due to the much lower profile of religion in canada, though i suspect the numbers would be fairly similar here. waxy"

119,notsarc,"well that's just wrong. the un partition plan was based on the idea of a two state solution. yes, the palestinians disagreed, but it was never the jewish peoples decision to make, to take what was given to the palestinians. the result - israel captured the other 50% land which was allotted to the arabs as per the partition plan. fair result in a war. if you believe israel's best claim to the land is when it took it from the arabs, i'm amazed that you're still defending it."
120,notsarc,"homework should take as long as needs to, also how do you have 9 hours school btw? and putting in 4 hours is impressive, assuming you don't have someone with a cat o' nine tails standing behind your chair. when i was your age i went absolutely insane, i'm amazed you can maintain such discipline."
121,notsarc,"yeah! its a benefit to be able to do a thing like that. i'm amazed that we've come so far in technology and science, but i think there is a line of what we can offer people. its not like they're gonna chose whether they want to have an egg or a bagel for breakfast."
122,notsarc,"wow ursus, uh, hmm, it's like i'm amazed but almost not surprised to hear that. i think it explains a lot. i wish and hope that they will realize that most non-religious people are rational, good-natured, well-adjusted folks that mostly want everyone to get along. (insert campfire song here) and that a lot of them fear a theistic government that limits freedom."
123,notsarc,heh. i'm amused that we both put 'massage' in quotes.
124,notsarc,"you know, i'm astonished at the fact that during an osce conference on combating discrimination and promoting mutual respect and understanding that took place in bucharest early in june, the attendees discussed all sort of things except the flagrant current situation in poland  this country gains the lead among european countries in violation of human rights in terms of anti-semitism, racism, hatred to moslems, xenophobia, homophobia, and discrimination against hiv-positive persons. this fact was evinced in poland's country report on human rights practices-2006 released by us department bureau of democracy, human rights, and labor. here i present you part of the report that has relevance to the subject. to put it short, there are quite a lot of people in poland who suffer persecution  jews, non-europeans (arabs, moslems, africans, roma), persons of alternative sexuality and hiv-positive persons."
125,notsarc,"i'm nothing if not a thoughtful atheist, but it's not skepticism that drove me from religion, but revulsion, and i absolutely refuse to let fear, the lowest of emotions and religions favorite trump card, to have any sway over my life when it comes to determining my religious beliefs. fear of judgement day is just one more trick religion has to get us to submit, and while i'm not surprised it worked to control illiterate savages and barbarians thousands of years past, i'm astounded so many people in this day an age allow themselves to fall prey to pascals wager."
126,notsarc,"why do you seem to have such an bone to pick with capitalism? it would be different if there were a proven superior system out there, but there isn't. capitalism isn't perfect, but it's the best we really have without giving way too much power to government. but i'm even more fascinated at how you tie religion to government policy like socialism or capitalism. i find that a rather strange mindset. i tend to think of religion an more of an individual thing rather than something to fuel government programs. a comment on capitalism doesn't really even belong in a discussion on satanism."
127,notsarc,"i'm not making fun of you lol i'm honestly amazed at how different people can be though the same age.  and srom, it's the internet. don't take anything you read off the internet seriously. and have you realized that maybe it's you that's the problem? i mean not the problem, but causing it. you may want to refine your debating techniques if you want respect on this site."
128,notsarc,"im not by any means generalising about men and women at all. but i'm honestly surprised that you have never met people that think this way. i personally know lots of people that pride themselves of being a 'player'. how could you not be aware of this? as for women, the majority of women i've come into contact with are seeking long-term to permanent relationships. often they find themselves being 'played' by guys who are after just one thing, and they sometimes are unfortunate to end up a single mother, while the dad continues to be a 'rolling stone' as for ideals, what i describe is no ideal by any stretch of the imagination. men that pursue women just for a one-night-stand are everywhere. im still baffled that you think i'm making this up"
129,notsarc,"this has nothing to do with my post. you don't need to believe in conspiracy theories to believe that the universe is pretty crazy. i'm an advocate of science, and even i admit that, especially at the quantum level, shit gets crazy. particles being in two places at once, 95% of the universe being undetectable, whole separate universes colliding to make new ones. it's crazy yes, but it is also scientific. in fact, compared to science, the answers psychics provide are rather boring. i'm impressed by the stuff i just listed, not some charlatan guessing whether or not i have a dog."
130,notsarc,"oh, good! but on a side note, keep up the new generation of education. your students are lucky, this in my opinion is the best was to truly learn and grasp an idea. i'm impressed that you took a step beyond the text book. keep up the good work!"
131,notsarc,"bravo, i'm impressed (i tried to come up with some clever rhyme but i couldn't think of anything)"
132,notsarc,"i noticed..., you got a public apology. i'm impressed ;)"
133,notsarc,"i'm not disputing the numbers, and i'm certainly not disputing the fact that bush won.  what i'm intrigued about is the razor thin margins, to my mind anyway, that characterize the us election system. don't you find it the least bit odd that it's been 30 years since a president received a plurality? waxy"
134,notsarc,"if i may hijack this thread (sad to do so as i love seeing people criticise bush), i'm intrigued by this idea that deindustrialisation is a bad idea. if it is, then most of the world is doomed to live in povety surely? there is only a finite manufacturing capacity within the word and it is far less than the total number of jobs required throughout the world. we have to be able to have countries that are heavily reliant upon service based jobs. are you sugegsting that this cannot work in the long term?"
135,notsarc,"i'm intrigued by that last tidbit there, infant baptism. can you please substantiate that with some scriptures?"
136,notsarc,"alright, i think i see your point know. however, i think the only way in which conservatives would be socialist is that they're soo capitalist they end up effectively swinging back to the other end of the spectrum by making people want to kill them. which is a silly argument because the proletariat ain't never rose up and not settled for simple tax breaks or what have you. furthermore, i'm intrigued by your fascism point, i'm just wondering how it affects the debate. are you saying that essentially all political ideals can effectively be reduced to the same ideology at their basest level?"
137,notsarc,"i'm intrigued, can you give one or two examples off of the top of your head?  good point as to the 2nd paragraph."
138,notsarc,"sorry dude, these links are either vague or irrelevant to the topic, the abstract to the phd thesis is on the guy's own website and doesn't give a link to the actual work. i'm not stating this doesn't happen, i'm just intrigued by the possibility and i don't buy into anything unless i can see some verified, hopefully peer-reviewed work, any search on google for these names doesn't give anything of value."
139,notsarc,"ya it's true, it was pretty hilarious. i'm just surprised he only got 7 days and a $1,000 fine. it is only single a minor leagues, but that was rediculous."
140,notsarc,"proof? and, i'm just surprised that brooks is actually capable of seeing where the problem lies. his solution? probably another dumb republican non-solution."
141,notsarc,"i'm kind of amused by the idea that the king james version is the most accurate, there are a lot of fairly well documented flaws, like the introduction of unicorns into the old testament. you also seem to imply that modern translations were dreamed up by a couple of drunken biblical scholars with nothing better to do on a friday evening, whereas most are at least as rigorously researched as the kjv, and often with a greater number of sources available."
142,notsarc,"i'm not talking about talk radio, i'm talking about rctv, the venezuelan station that had its licence withdrawn. i'm saying that if a us station were advocating the violent overthrow of the government, as rctv did, then it would lose its licence in a flash, not the 5 years the venezuelan government put up with it. i'm kind of amused by the idea of hillary clinton being a socialist though..."
143,notsarc,"to be honest with you, i'm mildly amused at best."
144,notsarc,"inasmuch as the idea of substantive due process is a contradiction in terms, i'm not all that surprised that it's history is quite complicated. the idea of substantive due process was indeed invented by judges, which just goes to show one thing: if it needed to be invented after the constitution was ratified, it wasn't part of the constitution to begin with. in other words, because the idea of substantive due process was not contemplated by the framers or ratifiers of the constitution, it is not a legitimate doctrine."
145,notsarc,"the argument has nothing to do with whether the bible is true or not, and everything to do with how certain concepts and interpretations are deduced from reading a piece of literature. i'm not arguing that i believe in a rapture, but rather that there is biblical support for a rapture event. i hope you see the difference"
146,notsarc,"the catholic position on evolution always seemed to me a rather supine cop-out, and i'm not at all surprised that some catholics are re-examining it. cardinal schonborn in his nyt article wrote schonborn has a fearsome reputation as an intellectual, but his demand that any scientific treatment of evolutionary theory has to start with an a priori assumption of design does not say a lot for his understanding of science."
147,notsarc,"i'm not enthralled to go to school. i really don't enjoy the experience. i do, though, know that it would be better for me and everyone else that goes to school. we can't depend on our country just being good, we have to actually do something to make it that way. education is the easiest way to do that. and, just for the record, i do go to summer school. where i live, summer school is only two periods per day, and i can only take certain classes. it really sucks. but, we have to look at the big picture. i don't like many of my classes, and i don't like many of my teachers. but i'm not going to sacrifice my education for comfort or the ability to relax, at least not in high school.  think about it. i'm sure you'd agree."
148,notsarc,"no they can't. their gods are the god of this world, and his name is satan. that's the problem with cults, they deceive and lead to death, not life. but i'll agree that the darkness has spiritual power, but nothing good can come of it. you know what's sad ? i'm not even surprised you would list wiccan as a valid religion that actually represents life and goodness."
149,notsarc,i completely agree. this school's decision is ridiculous to say the least but the sad part is that i'm not even surprised by this. this sort of thing seems to be happening more and more lately.
150,notsarc,"would you consider yourself philosophical? no, i don't think philosophy is useful. everything they claim that cannot be supported by science is simple word games, like the ontological argument. lolzor is the first person i have discussed philosophy with ever, and i'm not impressed with philosophy's lack of demonstrative capabilities."
151,notsarc,"the 9/11 commission omits the presence of molten steel from their official report. the 9/11 commission omitted it because...??? what is this deep dark secret they don't want the american public to know? which, according to you is easily figured out anyway. 'we could blow up a u.s. ship in guantanamo bay... omg. couple of cia guys brainstorming for solutions to a problem and people go nuts. if that's the worst of what they contemplated...i'm not impressed.  i'm sure conspiracies happen all the time but they are so rare as to be insignifigant. my wife and i can't even agree on a restaurant."
152,notsarc,"i'm not incredulous because miller isn't here, i'm incredulous that not a single one of the 'millions of other religious evolutionists' are here."
153,notsarc,"i'm not in the least surprised.. i stated that it was required by law.. i never said anything about when it became a requirement. as of now, in the year 2010 applying for a ss number is required.. would you say that is an invasion of privacy?..  and for your information clinton wasn't the first or last president to rape the social security program.. politicians have been using it as a personal bank for decades."
154,notsarc,"not that i was interested in joining them, but i did read the two links. i'm not much surprised that science has nothing to do with it...and not at all surprised that many actors are into it...hollywood has long been known to generate kooks. i suppose they are just a small portion of the total, but they are very publicized."
155,notsarc,"i'm not really surprised at the bush administrations lack of a forest management plan. he known for not being an enviromentally-friendly president. forest fires are usually a natural occurance. they are often good for the eco-systems.it's the man made disasters that are the problem. we can't stop forest fires, but we can keep the property damage to a minimum by thining forests, building access roads where posible to fight the fires, and have stricter control over timber harvests. often the timber companies over-cut certain areas, leaving the lanscape a barren, lifeless terrain, not suited for wildlife habitat. soil erosion can become a problem also, as the silt from the soil erosion pollutes the streams and damages the fish habitat. the government needs a good forest management plan for public lands, and more funding for personel to impliment the current programs of forest management."
156,notsarc,"while i can't say i'm a history buff, i'm not shocked about all that either. perhaps it's because i'm mostly a misanthropist."
157,notsarc,"as compared to how they would be during a period of instability? i said they were internally stable so we agree here, ahem. also the us is not unstable as far as external physical forces are to us. economic forces you could make a point but not the extent that everyone is declaring sanctions against us. that is what north korea is basically doing only it is a physical force that is building against them. the us has no external threat against them at this time that is as threatening as what north korea is facing and that is because the us is far more externally stable than north korea is. i'm not surprised that you declare the us evil for causing instability but give it no credit for creating this stability that we have been focused on."
158,notsarc,"i'm not surprised that you would hold that opinion, but studies show that a troubled relationship with two parents is better than a single parent situation.  http://www.wiskit.com/marilyn/custody.html http://www.civitas.org.uk/pubs/experiments.php "
159,notsarc,that makes sense since howard would not answer whether jesus is god or not. good catch! most attacks on true christianity center around who jesus is and whether or not the bible is the word of god. so i'm not surprised that's what we're dealing with. jesus is god!
160,notsarc,"well, i'm not surprised. the left coast rarely gets anything right. :)  btw, gm still has over 25% of the domestic vehicle market and it didn't get it by selling econoboxes like the japanese did."
161,notsarc,"well right now it's 20 minutes to the deadline, but i'm not optomistic. he hasn't logged in since my last post. i sent him a pm yesterday warning him that he had 24 hours, but since he hasn't logged in, i'm not surprised he didn't get it. if you can't stick to the deadline we agreed to before, you shouldn't have agreed to a formal debate. i'm sorry to say that i'm a little frustrated. although there is the chance that a miracle will occur and he will post in the next 20 minutes. but i'm not exactly holding out hope."
162,notsarc,that's ...... well i'm not surprised really. have you ever watched 2 1/2 men? it's content is all about charlie's character's sex life.
163,notsarc,"i thought the book was one of the most boring pieces of fiction i've ever read. i didn't finish it.  i'm not surprised that the movie version is a point of controversy. christians don't take well to versions of their belief system that question dogma, even those vehicles intended as general entertainment."
164,notsarc,"no one believes this. this is a non-issue. i'm not surprised you would respond that way jyoshu. you don't take these issues seriously at all. thus you can have a good laugh, and be sarcastic and think you are witty. in reality, it shows how clueless you are in terms of gay issues. 'the equality-obsessed modern gay pride movement'? gays don't have equality, and therefore there is a movement for that. i don't think anyone is obsessed with equality. i could just as quickly say there is an obsession with keeping gays in an unequal status."
165,notsarc,"find me a spell check plugin for firefox liminus. i had one for ie before i switched over.  frankly, i'm not surprised we're going to use that for police and military applications."
166,notsarc,"i'm not surprised you would say this. it is the statement of a person who would want power and control over a woman's womb, which, btw, inoygdb."
167,notsarc,"as we've seen in recent years, kids who are bullied can become so anti-social that they become violent, and attack those who've bullied them with weapons and mass murders. i'm not condoning this behavior, but i'm not surprised that it happens. those who support the bullying of gay kids and others...well, you get what you sow."
168,notsarc,"you'd be surprised. i'm sure something else will come up in the future that makes bs's nationalization seem quaint. still, it is pretty horrific what the fed did to the public. nationalization of debt while almost giving away revenue generating assets. seriously.  what is disturbing is that the american public just sat there while their government saddled them with additional debt that has no rational future revenues. but given the peanut gallery here, i'm not surprised the rest of the nation is as ignorant.  but as i spoke to symbiote, the next crisis will be much worse. we haven't solved ****. it's a poor quality band-aid, if that."
169,notsarc,"this guy's flip-flopped more times than i can count. i'm not surprised, nor will i be if he fails to follow through on his words."
170,notsarc,"i think that's an excellent question. since my area of expertise is chemistry and not climatology, i can only speculate that it's a combination of peer pressure, the desire to get funding and their allowing governments to manipulate their findings.  there have been several instances in which members of the ipcc have quit amidst claims that the final reports issued did not reflect their research. since the final ipcc reports are reviewed by politicians prior to being published, i'm not surprised with the claims made. here's a relevent story. "
171,notsarc,"thanks for that, jason. in esdraelon's defense, there are hundreds of authors of other religions who choose to take portions of our writ out of context, and morph them into something that looks like what he described. (a self-made god who has an alotted portion of the universe.) this is not the actual belief of lds. this is a skewed and exaggerated oversimplification of our doctrine of eternal progression. it's also what seems to be most commonly understood when an lds tries to briefly explain the doctrine.  in other words, i'm not surprised that esdraelon was under that impression."
172,notsarc,"i'm not surprised. we're living in an age when communication outside of our local group is becoming increasingly common. people are starting to hear ideas they never would have before. religion has generally survived because people's experiences were limited to the views of those immediately around them, those who pretty much shared those same views. today, and for a while now, that's been changing and people are hearing other things causing them to rethink what they've been taught."
173,notsarc,"that's interesting, because all of the things the bible apparently says about them is left to be intentionally vague and unanswered. for example - 'the bible, however, makes it plain that dinosaurs and people must have lived together. actually, as we will soon see, there is a lot of evidence for this.' great. now, where in the bible does it say this? because science has disproven that dinosaurs and humans lived together through carbon dating. that's a fact. the link you gave me cites zero scientific evidence, only incredibly far stretches of what the bible says. so, you've given me no proof. i'm not surprised."
174,notsarc,"he'll get to you eventually, he's doing them in order of points. lol though i'm disappointed to say that a lot of people, including myself, are starting to lose interest in the roasts. i'm not surprised though, because there's a lot of inactive users."
175,notsarc,"brooke got the boot! i'm not surprised, her performances last night were weak."
176,notsarc,"finally an other conservative in this site. i mean who do these people think they are? trying to pass amendments like the fairness act. but i'm not surprised that some order is coming back to are leaders. when the government swings to far to one side, (in this case left) its ganna swing back to the other side, we just as conservatives, need to make sure we don't go to right, or we'll have done just as bad as the liberals."
177,notsarc,looks like you're right. the movie scored #1 this weekend earning some $23 million. i guess i'm not too surprised since the johnny depp talk seems to have cooled down already.
178,notsarc,"i do agree. the rot started here when thatcher came to power, and became chronic when neil kinnock became leader of the labour party. now we have two parties in hock to corporate interests, and even if another party did get elected, their hands are tied because of the reaction of the financial markets. the actions of the ecb in bailing out hedge funds is a sign of how bad it has got. i think we'd best not discuss the solution otherwise we'll start to disagree again. :p george monbiot has the beginnings of a plan in his book age of consent. i'm quite surprised you agree with what is an essentially marxist analysis of the situation though."
179,notsarc,pretty damn disgusting. i'm quite surprised that you've never heard of it. i didn't think that it was still all that novel.
180,notsarc,"it depends on who's determining that it 'is not favorable'. it can be biased if the judge of it is biased.  a round earth is something we can observe in the here and now. i'm really surprised the 'flat earth' label is still tossed around by evolutionists today. it was used by evolutionists as early as the nineteenth century as a method of ridiculing christians. the fact is, most belief in a flat earth disappeared by the fifteenth century. the fact that evolutionists still use it is an indicator of the insecurity they have in themselves.  likewise, evolutionists have squat for origins, for the simplest forms of life. you'd think that after spending billions evolutionists would be able to come up with something for a foundation for their beliefs. but no - not one."
181,notsarc,"really??! it's stated, very clearly in the creeds. i'm somewhat surprised by this."
182,notsarc,"...and half right. preventing something that has been predicted does not create a paradox. your logic is severely flawed here. i'm somewhat surprised by that. if i predict that georgia tech will win the peach bowl and lsu comes up and prevents that, i still predicted it. i was just wrong. you are attaching something supernatural to nostradamus as if he really had some power to accurately predict the future. he made some lucky guesses...that's all. sometimes, the local fortune cookies are right, too. sometimes the horoscopes seem to fit. that doesn't mean that the writer's actually knew anything about their future readers."
183,notsarc,"you know full well that isn't what i said at all. i was pointing out the difference between dogma and church teaching. for the most part, as much as i ususally disagree with you, you are quite reasonable and know your facts before entering into a discussion. that's why i'm so surprised at you here. so what? there are hundreds of laws out there on the books that don't actually get enforced anymore. old hangers-on from a 150 years ago taht never got changed. just because it technically could happen doesn't mean it is relevant anymore."
184,notsarc,the aruba case fuelled a lot of bad blood around here. to be honest i'm still astonished about the whole thing. what idiot starts verbally assaulting wartime allies over a missing person's case?
185,notsarc,"yea - i'm still fascinated by the stories i'm told about wakan-tanka (great spirit), winter man, coyote, and other beliefs of the lakhota people. i wish i had the time to learn more of their traditions and beliefs. i could literally sit and listen for hours. unfortunately, i was just passing through the dakotas (town called bullhead or bull head?) and had to leave. i needed one of their of sweat lodge treatments at the time  real bad:)"
186,notsarc,i'm surprised no one has mentioned this guy before now: http://epedia.pbworks.com/f/platypusc-2.jpeg
187,notsarc,really?? i'm surprised you would want it to be true.
188,notsarc,"jim and ghost, i think you both missed my point. my fault, i should have been more clear. total disarmament was never my intention.  my point was, what kind of military might do you think it would take to pacify loosely organized militias of americans fighting an islamic occupier? at what cost? do you think they could ever completely subdue the insurgent force?  i don't, because i know i'd rather die than live under a regime that was everything i despised. when you're fighting for your way of life, your religion, or even your perceived freedom, continued motivation will never be a problem. you could take all the guns out of iraq, the insurgents would be throwing rocks at the american soldiers and each other. waxy ps - i must say i'm surprised at both of your stances on the 2nd amendment, i agree with you jim."
189,notsarc,"with the way things are going for all the networks, jim, i'm surprised he's lasted as long as he did. his methods were deemed obsolete even before all the controversy. but, i like him. at least he's going out in style - march, i believe - the anniversary (40th ??) when he took over for walter. too bad one bobble got him thrown into the dungeon."
190,notsarc,"though bush, in this case, was quoting abraham lincoln, i'm surprised not to have seen any comments regarding his references to god. especially in... 'those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves; and, under the rule of a just god, cannot long retain it.'"
191,notsarc,i'm surprised that they still have that on their website after bellesiles was proven to be a fraud. what do you mean by the dates?
192,notsarc,"that's pretty funny, the last two posts that is. that's actually interesting that the term started that way. i'm surprised that no one had coined a term before that though."
193,notsarc,the cinemas here have the similar ads prior to the movie. they also include one about talking during the movie. i'm surprised at how rude people are at the theater nowadays. emoticonxmad
194,notsarc,"i was awake, just not on at the time you posted this. high school starts waaaayyy to early. anyway, i'm surprised at how many people post while i'm asleep (around 11:30 - 5:30 est)"
195,notsarc,"i'm surprised that 'the sixth sense' didn't make anyone's list. the twist at the end totally caught me off guard and blew me away. i also like forest gump, slingblade, platoon, top gun, the wizard of oz, shawshank redemption. there are more but it's monday.... :p"
196,notsarc,"i'm surprised at the density of posters still attempting to tie zarqawi to saddam's government or (prior to us occupation resistance) al qaeda. his actions in iraq prior to the us invasion were limited to kurdish territory, where saddam was attempting to contain that rebellion, and zarqawi was never a disciple of bin laden. zarqawi's bio has been reviewed on the internet many, many times: http://www.weeklystandard.com/conten...4/094npvzg.asp as to al qaeda training camps in saudi arabia, they do exist in spite of publicized saud government attempts to eliminate them. even the most naive poster with even a minute understanding of the saud steel grip on their nation should be able to comprehend that if the sauds didn't want something, it wouldn't be there. and need i mention pakistan? http://www.wtnh.com/global/story.asp?s=1381324 http://www.nationalreview.com/commen...0402090859.asp"
197,notsarc,"i'm surprised that some people still aren't aware of what the chinese have done to upgrade their country. sure, certain areas like the financial sector are still lagging (which is why they won't float the yuan just yet), but when it comes to industry and infrastructure they're done a most admirable job. does anybody here also think it's kinda funny that a communist country is beating the us at their own game (i.e. capitalism)?"
198,notsarc,"@ raastee: i've glanced through your paper: i'm surprised you were allowed to get away with the sentence, 'irrationalism is a fallacy to be avoided'. irrationalism is not a fallacy: a fallacy is an apparently genuine but really an illogical argument. irrationalism, outside number theory, is merely a discourse or statement inconsistent with the use of reason."
199,notsarc,"reminds me of the cold war clamor of necessary 'defense' nuclear weapon parity with russia. considering the threats we make directed towards iran and others along with our occupation of iraq, i'm surprised our conceit hasn't made all of me and asia scramble for nukes. pakistan, 97% muslim, hides bin laden, governed by a general constantly avoiding assassination attempts, never a bad word about that us 'ally'. but they have nukes and delivery systems. i'd think iran believes, as we've shown, that the us doesn't spew the democracy at the point of a gun policy to those nations possessing nuclear weapons."
200,notsarc,"israel promises war if iran is allowed to develop nuclear weapons. that israel already has them is, of course, fine with the us. that pakistan, not exactly a pillar of stability, has them is not an issue. after what the us did to iraq i'm surprised every me country doesn't want nukes. but we'll continue the game on israel's terms and all cope with suicide bombers."
201,notsarc,"having been raised in texas as a child and teen, with many relatives still residing there, i'm surprised their educational system hasn't gone to the bible as its primary textbook. perhaps things have changed, but fundamentalist hypocrisy was at one time the law of the land in texas. maybe since texans are no longer served by oklahoma and louisiana bootleggers the fire and brimstone circuit has relaxed, but i'd find that difficult to believe as religion is a very effective control technique."
202,notsarc,"i think this is something everyone on here can get behind. at least i would hope so. saying that fred phelps is an embarrassment to this nation and my home state would be a gross understatement. sadly, i can't say i'm surprised by this, but i definitely don't think i would have ever predicted it. what he is doing is despicable. and what the patriot guard is doing is amazing. i like the sentiment involved in attempting to pass laws against protesting at funerals (although i don't know if they'll hold up in court), i only wish they had felt the same when he was protesting aids victims."
203,notsarc,"living in kansas myself, i'm surprised i haven't heard more about this. when this came up in missouri a few years ago, it was a huge deal."
204,notsarc,it's challenging enough for parents to fly with infants or children. i'm surprised a mother with children would complain. i'd think she'd have enough on her hands during the ride herself.  maybe she had hired help along. she certainly couldn't have been too busy with her own children. and she certainly must have been seated far from their seats and sounds. as a crying infant in front or back of her children was not her concern.
205,notsarc,"i'm surprised no one has mentioned the incident in burlington, vt. if you read the first story on that, you'll find out that women have the right to breast feed their baby anywhere the baby is allowed to be. while i would not be 100% comfortable with it, i recognize that if a mother chooses to breast feed her baby, she needs to be able to feed it when it's hungry, whether it be on a plane, in a car (not driving) or in a restaurant."
206,notsarc,"it's a pretty obvious counter question, i'm surprised it caught him so off guard. what's his name, if you don't mind my asking? i've got friends in illinois who would appreciate knowing about this, if they're in his district."
207,notsarc,"i agree. hence why we need to evict the gop from the congress today it is evident by the liberal history of the gop majority that they cannot be trusted with money, with the size of government, with foreign relations, with underage pages, with the military in general, with privacy, civil rights or even the most basic function of congress: oversight.  liberalism needs to be evicted from congress, therefore the republicans need to go.  it never stopped bothering me that more democrats voted aganist the schavio bill then republicans. democrats more conservative then republicans? well..given how far republicans have gone over i can't say i'm surprised."
208,notsarc,"well, i can't say that i'm surprised. just another politician for ya. they're all the same."
209,notsarc,"allright, well then i think it's odd too, arians would have made more sense. i'm surprised they are considered obscure, the council of nicea is historically considered one of the defining moments of the early christian church, and the arian controvery was it's main event. for the record, they were discussed in my high school, that's why i was making sure."
210,notsarc,"kudos, snakespit. i'm surprised that i'm saying that to you."
211,notsarc,"for someone who puts importance on the ability to think i'm surprised that you believe mentally handicapped people are as valuable as the average person. value is of course the key word here. value can be interpreted to mean many different things including value to the human society. even the humanistic perspective has to take into account that the human society as a whole even if it is only a small portion. i don't think the handicapped can hold a great deal of value in the human society when compared to the avereage 'intelligent and able-bodied humans', wouldn't you agree? if so then where do they make up for this imperfection to increase their 'value' to be equal to that of an able-bodied human?"
212,notsarc,"so as to comics/cartoons that have already been mentioned: calvin and hobbes, simpsons, south park, recess, and sponge bob rock my socks off. also pretty much all of adult swim. but i'm surprised no one mentioned this... the fairly odd parents... hella funny ****... oh my god.  that's it for me"
213,notsarc,"this is not good news at all. i'm guessing that there will be a lot of trouble in the near future. one thing that i would not recommend, and i'm surprised that you would even suggest it given your stance on others having an opinion about american elections, is the us getting more involved in there election process. pakistan has to be, and be seen to be, uncompromised in this process. smiley"
214,notsarc,"1st, i never said it was only geography. second .... stats please, regarding your new claim here? so you do think they are inversely proportional. (can't say i'm surprised, it's a view consistent with anti-religious prejudice.) there are plenty of christian scientists with phds that would, i suspect, disagree with you. and i have no idea what your point is on the homeschooling comment. homeschoolers often do better academically."
215,notsarc,"i hope it's obama too, but i will vote for clinton if necessary although i don't really trust her to end the war quickly.  (i must say i'm surprised that there is so little interest in discussing politics on this site given the huge number of comments elsewhere.)"
216,notsarc,"i can't vouch for what others believe. the creeds are a pretty accurate summary of my beliefs as regards who and what god is. the apostles' creed is the statement of belief used at baptism in most of christianity, so it would be strange for someone to have been baptised (or confirmed if they were baptised as an infant) without believing this to be true. to be honest i'm surprised by the idea that people (outside the pseudo-christian sects like the mormons and jehovah's witnesses) who claim to be christians would not believe what is stated in the creeds, it's not something that really occurred to me. i know that some people misunderstand the use of the word catholic in the last paragraph but that's about it."
217,notsarc,"he was a partial-birth abortion provider that killed babies late term. in terms of fetal viability he might as well been killing babies right after they'd been born. i don't condone it, but i'm surprised it didn't happen sooner--one monster killed by another. it wasn't right, but what that sicko doctor was doing was certainly no better."
218,notsarc,"and a lot of cosmetic surgery. you know, i'm surprised not more comparisons are done with vet care. i had my cat sliced open and a bunch of samples taken and a billion tests and 3-4 nights in the special vet hospital at a vet school. it cost me a fortune! something like $650 bucks. the same procedure which is done in humans (for cancer) costs over $100,000 from what i found out. now you'd expect it to be a lot more but really that much more?"
219,notsarc,"many americans feel that deploying our military in our own cities as a police force sets a bad precedent. i'm surprised you don't. it's one thing to use them in the case of a natural disaster where local police might be overwhelmed, but to open a shooting war with street gangs? chicago ain't rio de janeiro."
220,notsarc,"the reason that halo has been restricted to xbox is because microsoft bought bungie. they want to give people a reason to get a 360. that reason? halo. modern warfare, on the other hand, is owned by neither microsoft or sony. quite frankly i'm surprised that nintendo doesn't own everything already."
221,notsarc,people are destroyed mentally for life and some even kill them selves.due to what happened to them becuase it was so traumatic and most get away with one and do it again some even start killing thier victims so yea .i'm surprised that you are sticking up for rapists
222,notsarc,"1. no, she has a choice, abort or keep and support the child. 2. no, it makes a woman take responsibility for her body, like keeping her legs together. i'm surprised more people aren't in favor of this."
223,notsarc,"i've only had a quick look as i'm on the bus so research is limited but i'm sure the evidence for the 2000 year old israel is biblical, so is the promise from god which is what the modern israel is based on. i thought you thought the bible was stupid bronze age myths for creatards so i'm surprised to see you basing an argument on this. before the modern israel was created the land was part of palestine making it palestinian before it was jewish unless you go by biblical evidence and gods promise."
224,notsarc,"this is some thing we can agree on.  many women think it's a legal right to kill their children with abortion and people like me see it as a crime against humanity.  frankly, i'm surprised there are not even more debates created about it."
225,notsarc,"true, and i'm surprised no one has brought up resources... if there is x amount of a certain resource that we need to survive then when we reach an x amount of people, we could be factually overpopulated although i don't know how any such thing could be measured."
226,notsarc,to be honest i was playing devils advocate i'm surprised more people did'nt comment!!!
227,notsarc,i'm sure i will get bored with the site long before 13000 points. lol! i'm surprised he hasn't.
228,notsarc,"there are tax exemptions for a married couple which a gay person cannot get. that's taxation with unequal representation at the very least. you can't argue the logic of gay marriage, only weird theories of morality. i'm surprised you're attempting this."
229,notsarc,"i support you on these things, however christians are considered warlike as an artifact of the crusades. in which they killed plenty of people (crusades are similar to jihad fyi).  however that idea is outdated. this debate could very easily turn into a useless flamefest like most here on religion. also i'm surprised you didn't use machiavellian in your argument to describe those men. edit: what about iran? the iran-iraq war was clearly a religious war."
230,notsarc,i told you twice. i'm surprised you didn't get the message?
231,notsarc,totally agree. i'm surprised to see how many people think it's funny.
232,notsarc,1. i don't want criminals killed. you have no way of knowing what my wants are and i have never been so arrogant as to tell you what your wants are. 2. you are entitled to be wrong but you aren't entitled to your own facts. children in the womb are just as alive as you are. your denials of that fact not with standing.  3. your reasoning is flawed because you remove the component or aspect of guilt or innocence and substitute wants in p ace of it. your denial of the fact that it (a child in the womb) is alive is a huge red flag on that.  i'm surprised that more pro-aborts don't call you on it.
233,notsarc,"intangible i'm surprised at you from what i've seen your very fair in your debating style, and i understand you don't want to see more suffering, but do you not think there might be a better way ?"
234,notsarc,"i'm surprised that you disagree, seeing as how you've seen the hills have eyes. i'd say hills have eyes was one of the more disturbing films."
235,notsarc,"real version ? (lol, i know what you mean, the original ad is annoying, but i'm surprised only you've noticed this isn't the original)"
236,notsarc,"pro-choice - i agree but first trimester only pro-euthanasia - i agree pro-environmentalism - mmmm? depends pro-gay rights - again... depends pro-immigration ( to an extent) - legal? yes! illegal? no. pro-free healthcare - disagree anti-military action/intervention - mmmm... less, yes but depends anti-globalisation - agree anti-death penalty - disagree pro-stem-cell research - agree pro-gun control - disagree pro-welfare. - disagree pro-marijuana legalisation - agree pro-tobacco illigalisation - disgree i'm surprised you're anti-globalization"
237,notsarc,he has been around with a debate about democracy. i'm surprised you missed!
238,notsarc,i'm surprised i agree with you on this. the only point i'd add is that the force feeding should only be used while the person is undergoing therapy to fix the underlying problems.
239,notsarc,digg/reddit/mixx/propeller/etc what is the difference really? i'm surprised mixx is cd rather than cg.
240,notsarc," i'm surprised. you're saying those are political systems? and that they work well historically?  i'm saying that they operate like political systems, with the leaders of each respective religion issuing edicts that the followers are expected to obey, and often at the penalty of social repercussions if they do not. i measure effectiveness in the ability of the system to survive and spread."
241,notsarc,"no david, soc wouldn't be on a separate part of this site. he proved his mettle time and time again. the problem is becoming constant and i'm surprised you hadn't noticed. since the terrible incidents with repubgal, 14 years of age and involving the abortion/pro-choice debates, i've been able to simply sniff them out...and every time i feel i should look at the profile..bammmmm!!! i'm right with the exception of some that take my breath away because they know so very much at such a young age."
242,notsarc,"well... like i said, considering how many people are sharing earth, i would think we would get a long a lot less than we do. i'm not saying we do get a long very well, but i'm saying i'm surprised we get along as well as we do.. you understand?"
243,notsarc,i'm totally surprised i've posted so many posts in this thread: not like me at all.
244,notsarc,"is it that this has already been discussed a lot elsewhere? if that's the case, let me know. otherwise, i'm very surprised people aren't talking about this. simone? anyone?"
245,notsarc,i'm very surprised to learn that religious institutions are exempt from the normal taxation associated with having employees.
246,notsarc,i also love it when people look at the world reasonably.
247,notsarc,"jitobear, i always love it when you post. you are succinct and to the point and i always wish i had said what you said."
248,notsarc,"this might surprise you but i find you quite impressive as well. despite my criticisms, i am absolutely impressed with how you are able to consider a diversity of views, which, i must say, you are getting a lot better at."
249,notsarc,"honestly, i am amazed, so there are actually gay people with a sense of reason. i have spent years of facing discrimination from narrow minded homosexual activists and all these years later, you are the only one that has ever demonstrated somewhat of a sense of reason beyond the same old hogwash i have seen demonstrated by thousands i have interacted with. i still have my reservations towards suspecting that somehow you might be attempting to set me up for a slam."
250,notsarc,"i am amazed you think al gore is lsong the debate last time i checked he has a global scientific consensus supporting his position, you know that means that the majority of the worlds scientists. http://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-scientific-consensus.htm "
251,notsarc,"i see why you would think this, and i am amazed by some of the people who have children, but it may be used as population control, and that's not right. i do think that it would be worthwhile to perhaps do evaluations, but people could lie, and corruption could take the entire thing way out of control."
252,notsarc,"again i am astounded by the fact that you think i will endanger children. it is a topic sunset, so why are you calling me demented and sick.  would you agree that everybody in this world is different? everybody thoughts are different. so when someone has different views than your own, you have the nerve to say they are sick.  i know i called you sick. but i said it purposely because you called me sick for foolish reason.  my problem is that i hate it when people call me sick and demented. that is not the person i am and to be hated on this site for my views is completely stupid. i hate the fact that i can't be 'accepted' because of my views."
253,notsarc,"yes its overused a lot but i think the company that needs to take a break and work on things is infinity ward because they don't have as good as games the only game i enjoyed from the cod franchise is mw2 and that was amazing they did a good job on it, but for mw3 all they did was use the same graphics and everything from mw2 except new campaign, spec ops mission, multiplayer weapons and perks and killstreak options but to me they did a horrible job for mw3. they need to stop for 1 year, and come up with ideas to make a better infinity ward game. i am impressed with treyarch and what they did!"
254,notsarc,yeah but i don't hate gays because they are still people i just hate the sin and the lifestyle that they are in.  wow i have never seen an atheist who is against gay marriage. i am impressed.
255,notsarc,"that is a poor argument. if you want to become better at debate, in general, don't make statements you cannot back up, but never say that your using 'what i've been told' as an argument. your opposition will tear you apart. :)  think about a specific statement that you think you can prove through a series of logical arguments regardless of your personal feelings on the subject and invite me to a private debate on it. i am impressed with your willingness to debate any topic with an open mind compared to many others i have seen on this site and would enjoy debating you in a more formal structure. if you agree, of course."
256,notsarc,"it is not appropriate on this site to call people names. i understand that you are still learning in school and are busy, but i think that they taught basic spelling and grammar at a much early age than 16, so there is really no excuse! i did take the time to google your school, but you are too young to realize that maybe this is not the only coolidge hs in the country... so i went with the first google result... i am not impressed, the school gets a 4 out of 10 and 3 out of 5 stars from parents!"
257,notsarc,i lived in sevilla for the better part of year. spaniards are extremely good at staying out of other people's business. smiling at a stranger on the bus is invasive. i am not surprised most spaniards support gay marriage - most likely because they would never assume it was any of their business.
258,notsarc,"i am overwhelmed watching phelps. he is totally part man part fish. i also think that his attitude shows through, he seems to be highly upbeat and still very focused on the goals which he has set for himself.  jesse owens had his time and place and will never be forgotten. he opened the door for all the wonderful black athletes we see at almost every event at the olympics. but today, right now, phelps is the man."
259,notsarc,"if you want to get rid of them, i know a falconer in your state (iirc you are in texas) who would probably like to come and trap that coopers for you. i keep a red tail and a coopers hawk and he was up not long ago (he keeps a falcon) and we went out quail hunting on horseback. he was extremely impressed with the coopers dash-and-kill ability.  if it was me, i would just sacrifice the few birds that it kills in order to be able to watch the hawks...but then i am partial to raptors."
260,notsarc,"paul.boys, thank you for this little historical footnote. i must add that i am quite shocked to learn of this but not surprised. i think that in now disapproving as a society of child prostitution shows that we have advanced socially--and i argue that it has to do with becoming a more secular society and granting more rights and equality to women and children--as opposed to the almost divinely conferred 'father' right often practiced in old christianity before it was forced to reform by feminism."
261,notsarc,"now, if we're talking natural insemination by donor, that would likely be morally unacceptable in most circles, though certainly not all. really? i mean that sincerely. sometimes i am really surprised by what people find immoral. most people seriously object to that? why? o.o"
262,notsarc,"i don't think i am shocked, i am scared! lol"
263,notsarc,"i am trying to become a going in to college for pre-med and i am shocked at the big decline in competion for such courses. not only has obamas healhcare programs overestimated the capability of our current amount of healthcare providers, but it is also deterring many from seeking such careers. by trying to help everyone in the short term, he is doing more damage to everyone in the long term."
264,notsarc,"no, did you? i don't get why this debate seems to have pissed you off, but it is rather perplexing. i say that everyone deserves human rights; children and adults. am i wrong? i say that privacy is a human right. am i wrong? therefore, privacy is deserved by all human beings; children and adults. am i wrong? get over any issues you may have had, because one person's issues with privacy does not ultimately relate to every other child in the entire world; this is an obvious fact in life and i am shocked that you do not understand this."
265,notsarc,"i think the the p. bagatti is the one that found the burial caves in 1873, not the bagatti who was working in the mid 40's. i have unable to get a copy of the original manuscript the leadership u describes. i think it is only in italian though. i am surprised that such a  'key discovery' from the 19th century is kept so quiet except by claims of an evangilical web site."
266,notsarc,"actually, quite correct. i am surprised. i woudl have thought you more of the relativistic type."
267,notsarc,i am surprised i am going out on a limb saying that i dont think we will find them now. it is possible he dispensed with them to terrorists when we attacked..
268,notsarc,i am surprised people wanted m-80s and stuff like that legal. they accounted for most of the injuries due to fireworks and most of the fires. probably not a smart idea to have them.
269,notsarc,i am surprised a little to see providence college on the list....they are not gay friendly but they do have a gay straigtht alliance and an office of gay studies....i am from providence so i have been there.
270,notsarc,i am surprised that some of the more conservative christians are not weighing in on source of some of the christian terminology and concepts.
271,notsarc,"bassman: i am surprised by most of your recent posts of late. i site this one example above. i am bothered that you posted this rhetoric again. i gave you the statistics and the government websites that support those statistics, that show the millions of people raised from poverty since 1968. from over 22% of the us population in the early 1970s to fewer than 10% in the 1990s, and yet you continue to misinform. you claim to be a christian and mislead just like the scribes and pharisees of jesus day. to purposefully misrepresent the facts is the antithesis of christian behavior and brings into question your very claim to christianity as well as makes suspect your personal agenda which seems much more counterfeit than you would like people to know."
272,notsarc,"my parents moved to shawnee not long ago. when i was a kid, anything west of lenexa was considered too close to desoto, and a little suspect :) i was up that way not long ago, and even deoto is fairly respectable now :) :)  i am surprised there are so many here from kansas. there is somebody here from lenexa as well."
273,notsarc,"i am surprised at your response since i see your posts as well considered and stated. i asked the question and you answered. to me it was clearly, by definition, inflammatory. we can agree to disagree and let readers make their own determination."
274,notsarc,i tend to agree; i am surprised some regulars here seem to intend on even giving this poster the time of day and converse with him after the stuff posted the other night.
275,notsarc,"libertarianism emphasises freedom of the individual, and limited government. a stereotypical libertarian view would be for the legalisation of prostitution. that's why i am surprised."
276,notsarc,"i don't :( tell me, inbox me if you don't want to say it in front of other's.  i am surprised i thought you would be to holy to have lust."
277,notsarc,"as sharp as you are, i am surprised you missed my sarcasm. it happens. we do usually like to stir things up when it interests us. we sell weapons to taiwan and israel.  well then we have nothing to worry about. i didn't say that. we should be concerned by how much money is poured into these black ops programs. i support them, but i am concerned about over spending on them."
278,notsarc,can you believe the stupidity of those who think it acutally is not sex? i am surprised that the two on this board who thinks its not sex won't comment on it. lol
279,notsarc,you are a very good student of buddha. i am very impressed.
280,notsarc,i am very surprised to learn that you make vows before god and hold them sacred.
281,notsarc,"dont begin to understand real love till 18 or older i felt real love when i was 13, and i was with that woman i loved for years. saying someone can't effectively do something until they reach a certain age is ridiculous; turning a certain age doesn't magically make you any wiser nor dumber."
282,notsarc,it was a little hectic when you came in last night but i guess we could do it today in choir if you wanted to.
283,notsarc,lol! well you may have picked the wrong answer choice though??? i guess not much can happen in the desert... maybe a dust storm or something? we get tornadoes here... i was in one as a kid! crazy stuff.
284,notsarc,"sometimes it's fun to play devil's advocate but i guess it's just a people thing. we experience life with these 'rights' and we don't want to give them up, and anyone who brings up an argument against them we shun and flee from."
285,notsarc,i see. i just never came through to see it as worth the buy. i guess i borrow a friends copy.
286,notsarc,"a drink. a drink. one or two. and what the hell does abstinence have to do with this? everything in moderation, yeah yeah. all that fun stuff. i get it. i wasn't talking about light drinking. i guess i should clarify but i thought you'd catch what i meant."
287,notsarc,"that's true i suppose; usually someone makes the plan for them, so i guess i get points for my own initiative, heh"
288,notsarc,"yes if both sides agree to it, as i mentioned in the next sentence, but honestly, how many children do you know or parents that would allow their child to have sex with an adult, as i also said. i guess you never heard of child grooming. no government does not mean no morals or parent leadership. kids are still at the whim of their family. government means enforced morals."
289,notsarc,"i am being real man i guess i got to be more specific answering debates at some points. it's ok to teach your kids the dangers of having sex when they a about 5 since they won't know nothing about it or letting boys or girls taking advantage of them but, far as getting more in dept about it, in my opinion can wait until they are much older."
290,notsarc,"okay, i guess i'll have to watch the new batman movies soon. what did you think of the opening scene to x2? with nightcrawler trying to assassinate the president? one of my favorite scenes from any movie. yeah, each spider-man movie was worse. last i heard, they are planning a complete reboot without tobey or raimi."
291,notsarc,"hmmmm..., unwanted competition...., i guess you are all on that database then ;)"
292,notsarc,just ignore him sometimes this guy is an idiot. i guess atheists will continue questioning everything untill there is no structure.
293,notsarc,"ah, i see. thank you for the clarification. i do not see anything innately bad about that in and of itself, i guess. plenty of 'accident' babies end up having fine lives with responsible parents."
294,notsarc,"you wouldn't be a commodity at all if you weren't willing to sell, you'll be hunted though. i guess you could rent out your labor for a time if you somehow didn't get hunted and weren't willing to sell your genetic material."
295,notsarc,"too right. l. ron hubbard is the closest thing the modern world has to jesus: skeezy, probably un-bathing, secretly greedy but always with a generous front. well, i guess mother theresa would be a close second to l.ron h. xenu."
296,notsarc,"'first off, turn off your damn caps; it only makes you look like a raging troll (which you probably are).' ok i think that i can turn my caps on and off any time i want. but the reason i had caps on that time is becuz i forgot to turn them off  'second, i'm not forty, i'm fifteen. the author of twilight is (believe it or not) almost forty. ' well then i guess i missed something didn't i, and so the rest of my statement does not aply. i am sorry if i offended you in any way but i am so for harry potter movies just becuz every one can act. but i just can't get into the book . too damn big plus i already knew every thing in the book becuz of the movie(well at least the important stuff). so i am sorry"
297,notsarc,"ohhh, okay. well, i guess since i don't know, i can't answer that question. i don't really know if i believe. i haven't been given a reason too, but i'm not set in that state of mind, and i acknowledge the potential and likelihood for god to exist.  i'm in the middle.  it's sort of like this (in terms of belief in god):  atheist-------------------agnostic----------------------christian "
298,notsarc,i have a reputation to maintain. most people stay on this site for about a year. i've been here for almost 3 years now? i guess you haven't learned that you shouldn't try to teach a pig to dance. nor have you learned that you shouldn't wrestle with a pig. you can't win and the pig likes it ;)
299,notsarc,"this man has a valid point. but i guess the people he mentions, the extremists and the racists will overlook his wisdom because that's the way they work."
300,notsarc,"i guess this disease is 'contagious' thus due to this contagious disease it can spread rapidly. if he dies then no one gets infected and vice versa. although, i believe that if that is the situation i don't the infected persons opinion matters. if you possibly may kill even 1 person you will probably be isolated from social world and be taken to a place where you have no contact with the public no questions asked."
301,notsarc,"theres no scientific studies that disproves nor supports them. so i guess yes, its 50/50 so more or less half of these are likely to exist right? every imaginary thing that i could make up, half of that is probable to existing if they all can't be proven or disproven?"
302,notsarc,"i guess you get some credit, but this seems to be way more effective."
303,notsarc,hey? what happened to prodigee's sock account that was cussing me out??? it used to be here... i guess andy deleted it. :(
304,notsarc,that means his life was aborted to. i guess you don't know what goes on during an abortion.  it's a pretty gross process.
305,notsarc,"i guess that you didn't look at my last link. there are recalls every year that effect millions of cars, and those companies are not being bullied by the government. the point is every car company has recalls, and the government is targeting toyota. ford, gm, buick all have recalls. why are they not targeted? so, the government is the almighty paternalistic big brother punishing those bad and irresponsible companies who only care about themselves and wreck endless destruction to society and the environment. no, toyota is committed to fixing faulty accelerator only because of accusations for causing accidents."
306,notsarc,oh thanks i guess it was you who have been upvoting my arguements huh ? xd thanks!  allies ?
307,notsarc,"i just love how you call it a baby and not 'contents of the uterus' or 'product of conception' or 'fetus'. the truth is, that was a child."
308,notsarc,"pride; a feeling of pleasure from one's own achievements, the achievements of those with whom one is associated i just love how you people try change how something is said just for your own self preservation. you are still being prideful, whether it's of yourself or of someone/something else."
309,notsarc,i love how hamas apologists require showing idf abuses to defend their actions. pathetic.
310,notsarc,"i love how the liberals are incapable of even getting mccain's age right. my idiot sister-in-law argued with me that mccain is 80! gimme a break. from your lips to god's ears, archangel. emoticonxangel"
311,notsarc,i love how brown got shut down. nom is a bigoted organization full of people who put out hateful and misleading propaganda that hurts and tearsat the struggle for equality tolerance in this country.
312,notsarc,i love how all you try to define what i believe? how do you know what i believe?
313,notsarc,"here's what i said: i love how the second clip of kids singing, all they say is 'can we make america better? yes we can.' and still that nut job is crying about it. here's what you said: 'yes we can' is kind of an obama thing, in case you didn't know. now, i'm not sure about what part of that makes you think that i don't know that 'yes we can' is 'kind of an obama thing.' but my point was that beck is insane, and it doesn't matter how good and unpolitical the message is, beck will always try to demonize anything even remotely connected with our president. which can only lead me to the question, why do you and glenn beck hate america so much? it's very unamerican of you."
314,notsarc,"first off, i love how you celebrated america's birthday in alaska with mexican food. lol. also, why 1am? what time does the sun set there? i know it's late, but how late? i went to holland in june 2003 and the sun was up well after 10. it was amazing."
315,notsarc,"i love how you broke that down, but why would anyone who feels content in their life, by into something that's telling them they are wrong? it seems like they are cutting out a big portion of their market with a certain sin that harms no one."
316,notsarc,i love how everyone on this side is downvoted. i upvote you.
317,notsarc,"oh, i was joking x) i love how i look and accept myself completely, most days. i do have those mopey days that nothing can convince me i look good x)  but you're right :)"
318,notsarc,"cbs sportsline is great, i love how everything refreshes quickly without having to refresh your page every five seconds."
319,notsarc,"i love how the right accuses the left of star f---ing, yet it's the right who is always electing celebrities..."
320,notsarc,i love how it is 7 to 1.................. this is just the best.
321,notsarc,"yeah cartman is definately the best, i love how how epicly his evil is portrayed as e.g. scott tenorman must die"
322,notsarc,"i love how every line, except number 3, has a winking emoticon at the end. haha"
323,notsarc,"i love how the creator is also just like, sure whatever ."
324,notsarc,"i love how this guy screwed up the alignment on this page... but the basis of the argument is that evil is the lack of god, which makes it literally impossible for god to commit evil. but this raises the problem that god is then not capable of all things. he couldn't sin even if he wanted to. he is not all powerful. since he is not capable of doing something that even a weak human could do."
325,notsarc,"i love how i'm reading a serious answer and in the middle of it, ' rapture means rape in old french... have fun'. this is my ideal reasoning. to have an answer both serious, yet comical."
326,notsarc,"i love it when people say that bush got us into the war. it seems that the most educated people will forget everything they learned about the us government when they bad-mouth bush. so, in case you forgot, the decision to go to war must be approved by the very people we choose to go to washington and do that job, not just the president. if you are against the war, blame everyone who voted yes and stop whining that bush started the war, he was not a dictator."
327,notsarc,yeah horses are so cute i love it when they eat sugar right out of my hands it's so tickly
328,notsarc,"i love that you guys dont seem to be joking when you talk about it being offensive to gays - if anything i would think only tom cruise would find it offensive - because of his claims that he isnt gay (obviously untrue) gays would probably cheer if he (along with his penis) would come out of the closet if someone would find this offensive, it wouldnt be me vs gay guys - it would be me vs overly sensitive and selfrighteous guys who happen to be gay"
329,notsarc,"i love when people down-vote without giving an arguement as to why. guys, this isn't facebook, its a debate site."
330,notsarc,i love when they wag their tails and smile. awe. :) <3 .
331,notsarc,i love when my feet get rubbed after a long day. its really relaxing and i dont mind rubbing a mans feet.... as long as they don't stink
332,notsarc,i love when my feet get rubbed after a long day. its really relaxing and i dont mind rubbing a mans feet.... as long as they don't stink you are a woman after my own heart.
333,notsarc,"if they've started shooting they'll either have to terminate the movie or kill him off :/ like they did with the crow, i guess. i was pretty shocked when i heard about it."
334,notsarc,haha i don't hate him! he added me as an enemy! :p i was shocked when he did! haha
335,notsarc,"seriously man, i hope you don't believe what they tell you on that channel. it's just whoa. this one anchor woman was talking about how background checks led to registration than extermination; i was shocked. the thing with fox is, they put on whatever rupert murdoch wants."
336,notsarc,"i totally agree, while 9/11 was a terrible tragedy, america has been involved in some very shady dealings with the government and people supporting terrorism in other countries throughout history so while i was shocked and appalled by what happened that day there was part of me that thought you reap what you sow"
337,notsarc,"do you support legislation that would outlaw gay marriage? do you oppose funding nasa?  but abortion is quite different from any of those because it's giving people the right to kill something that is living. the government also supports hunting, granting hunting licenses to millions of individuals. the animals being hunted have a far greater ability to feel pain and emotions than the fetus in the womb being aborted.  i cannot see why the government should be able to legalize something that is clearly wrong, playing god in the process. because it's not clearly wrong. there are other opinions out there other than your own. all you seek to do is deprive people of their choice, and impose your will upon the masses. let's all be glad you are not in a position of power, for you would abuse it undeniably all in the name of 'god'."
338,notsarc,"14 or 12... that is a ridiculous statement. drinking can affect the brain growth, and it goes through it most radical transformation at that age. oh yeah let's all stuff up the new generations brains and crap.. smart idea. if they were able to dink legally at that age it would encourage more to drink. many around that age aren't able to find alcohol really. it would make the situation worse than making it better.. the increase of binge drinking would also increase, it is at where it now because usually a person of that age, if they are able, cannot acquire a high amount of alcohol."
339,notsarc,"i'm pro-choice because when i get pregnant, i want to chose whether or not i will abort it. i am not pro-abortion because i don't want to be forced to aborting my child when i get pregnant i am not pro-life, because i don't want to be forced to have my child when i get pregnant. i am pro-choice, do not call me pro-abortion, because that is not what i am. i don't go on the streets and say ''hey, let's all have abortions'' you on the other hand go on and say ''hey let's give all fetuses life'' that's what makes you pro-life. i don't want abortion. i wish no one would chose it because it would be much better without it. but the world isn't ideal. don't change the title, i just want people to know that we are called pro-choicers."
340,notsarc,"this is what your arguement would look like if you were talking about gun control: 'i'm pro-choice because when there's a threat in my neighbourhood, i want to chose whether or not i will buy a gun or not. i am not pro-guns because i don't want to be forced to buy the gun when there is a theat in my neighbourhood. i am pro-choice, do not call me pro-gun, because that is not what i am. i don't go on the streets and say ''hey, let's all buy a gun!' i don't want a gun. i wish no one would chose it because it would be much better without it. but the world isn't ideal.' the only choice pro-life and 'pro-choice' disagree on is whether there should be a right to abort in certain circumstances."
341,notsarc,"agreed. god does exist in some form, whether you want to call god a supreme being or whatever, there is a greater power out there thats beyond our comprehension. in the meantime lets all just get along"
342,notsarc,oh really? stop lying to yourself pal. http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/shouldzoophiliazoosexualitybelegal http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/                                       should itbelegaltohavesexwithdogs_3
343,notsarc,oh really mic? care to explain  http://www.createdebate.com/user/points/preschaffy http://www.createdebate.com/user/points/chaffy http://www.createdebate.com/user/points/                                       mrshellno  all 3 accounts that are said to be yours down-voting arguments on your debate out of the blue for no reason great way to irrefutably prove they are your accounts.
344,notsarc,oh really? when did the story of him being on drugs come out? did you even listen to the police scanner on that night? you do know right that the entire story makes no sense whatsoever... right?
345,notsarc,oh really? show me evidence of people who fully died and came back. and i mean fully dead.
346,notsarc,oh really? this isnt cyber bullying. this is barely slander. you arent returning fire. this is stupid. freedom of speech isnt a two way street. you have restrictions. both legal and moral. what the hell is going on?
347,notsarc,oh really? like when? and when have you seen me drive? i hardly drive. now your the liar.  liar liar liar!
348,notsarc,oh really? i prove evidence to the subject and i don't repeat the same thing over and over again. i am not repeating anything over and over am i. i think you are the worst debator.
349,notsarc,"'christians have been just as bad' oh really? when? and if the only thing you can answer the crusades, that was a war started by muslims, and so-called christians fought back"
350,notsarc,"oh really?  science does not say 'we dont know x, y, z, but we want to know x, y, z, and so we observe x, y, z, and come up with our conclusions and claim it to be true, or not? (it's a question..) if scientists were too busy learning what is, then the science that is present now, would be non existent, because in order for science to learn and understand, it must be too busy learning and understanding what 'might be', or what it has not known, yet."
351,notsarc,"oh really xaeon? netherlands has had prostitution legal for years and they are one of the most primary destinations for humans being trafficked. europe has many countries who have legalized prostitution but suffer from increased human trafficking. but maybe the us is different?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prostitution_in_the_netherlands  with it legalised more people are having sex with whores, and as soon as a whore is infected she doesn't even know it yet, so if she gets infected with hiv she still has sex with customers up until the day her next 'check up' is which is usually once a week. what happens to the infected prostitute? she gets kicked out onto the street. so thats one more woman infected, and possible many more men."
352,notsarc,oh really? hitler placed fear in those who wanted to oppose him in germany. fear is the best weapon to crush opposition.
353,notsarc,"economic understanding does not come from a series of graphs and equations that come from a man who has no understanding of how humans work. the economy is not some mechanical machine, it is an organic mass of all 7 billion people of the world making millions decisions every day. behind all the smoke and mirrors, all this man said was this, in other words, concluded bullshit is still bullshit.  and your second point, companies also compete on a technological level, if they aren't as advanced as their competitors they generally go out of business because people want the better quality/cheaper product. what is the states incentive? getting re-elected? oh wait, thats easy to do when 95% of voters have no clue as to what is going on and only think about politics for 5 minutes during the elections."
354,notsarc,"oh yeah, and the only thing better on pc's is that they have more choices of games. but im satisfied with my mac."
355,notsarc,"oh yeah, i forgot that i wrote 'anti-gay,' i was thinking of gay films."
356,notsarc,"oh yeah, and i'm pretty sure my display picture has pissed off a lot of people, and if it has; i'm glad ;)"
357,notsarc,oh yeah. the things i do for fun just ruin my appetite. i like to look at bacteria under a couple of microscopes i have. sometimes i just place random bacteria together to see how they react. usually they dont do anything. if you do have questions don't be afraid to ask.
358,notsarc,"oh yeah, i forgot that you believe that the corporate media and corporate leaders have gotten together to create war and put innocents in jail. i will admit that the powers of the executive branch have gone way too far, but i still believe that being at war means we have to treat the enemy like our enemy, and not like american civilians. do i agree with the war? no. but that's only because i feel that we could have done this all with special forces and not with an invasion/occupation. i would still support detaining terrorists captured in battle/mission (and if they're americans, give them a proper trial, not a military tribunal or some bullshit like that)."
359,notsarc,"baby, i am going to publicly say that if it wasn't for you i would be so out of here . oh yeah and for merlin too"
360,notsarc,oh yeah!!! nice! (i couldn't find the real one... so this will have to do.)
361,notsarc,the main reason i'm even say that i'm a conserative is my ideology of fiscal responsibility. obama breaking the record on spending. gw not really a true conservative in the matters of budget. kind of shattered that reputation for the republicans. my main guy that i listen to and he is a genius on money is ron paul. i don't believe in all of his policies but when it comes to money and the economy he's the shit.  oh yeah stick to the debate. you can't make laws against teens near the same age that want to have sex. anybody every read the book or see the movie 1984?
362,notsarc,oh yeah same here. i sadly have no more tolerance for prodigee anymore. i highly dislike him. hopefully this doesnt sounds harsh.
363,notsarc,oh yeah. that is the one up-side of it. bleh! :p
364,notsarc,"oh yeah! i remember tulip. calvinism seems to be more realistic, as it's more correctly grounded in man's sinful nature."
365,notsarc,"oh yeah, cuba has extreme poverty, how stupid. that is not socialism the on:y thing you share in socialism is the surplus value, which no one deserves, the gov. uses it to but free life necessities. the labor value is something you deserve for your labor and you get to keep it because it is yours. you buy luxuries with it."
366,notsarc,"oh yeah, lets just say all the main people on comedy central."
367,notsarc,does the pacific ocean truly 'exist' ? oh yeah 3000! time to celebrate!
368,notsarc,"oh yeah, they all have a secret meaning to me, lol except the dna helix, i just really love biology x) i much prefer to have something permanent on me meaningful."
369,notsarc,oh yeah sorry about that. i totally agree with you. just a little bit lost in communication.
370,notsarc,oh yeah i said that because what he said was a sweeping statement and i was just pointing out what he posted is not always the case.
371,notsarc,"oh yeah, and robert a. heinlein for his amazing sci-fi work; most notably starship troopers and puppet master"
372,notsarc,"oh yeah! i remember that one... abbynestor was going off on everyone, so i told to to calm down and then everyone (including the people she was ripping on) starting yelling and calling me a dick.  like honestly dana got called a bunch of nasty stuff, i try to defend her and she gets snappy with me...like what? that's why i'm going to stay away from that stuff now."
373,notsarc,"1st calm down. 2nd. a fucking definition of bisexuals that they are only attracted to full males and full females from merriam-webster 'characterized by a tendency to direct sexual desire toward individuals of both sexes' i don't see anything about having to like full males or full females, sounds like something you made up to try to make a point. 3rd it's 'bi' not 'multi'. then why aren't pansexauls called multisexuals? oh yeah because there's still only two sexes, and multi means more than one and pan means all...sooooo... yeah they're the same thing"
374,notsarc,"oh yeah, i went to see the new movie a couple of weeks ago, it's probably the most interesting film i have seen in a long time. i actually bought the book because of the movie and i am going to read it sometime in the near future. looking forward to it!"
375,notsarc,"oh yeah... that... well... but what a sweet way to go, right ;)"
376,notsarc,then why america instead of britain (oh yeah) americas the more powerful one
377,notsarc,"i'm not 100% sure what set of facts you are working from, but they are not the correct ones i assure you. way more jewish people were killed than died in the iraq war. when you add everyone killed in wwii iraq is not even a comparison. let me make it clear, i'm debating the lesser of two evils here, (speaking of the war, i'm not for the assassination of bush. you can't kill someone for being an idiot, if so kill everyone who elected him, not just him... which would be more people than wwii and iraq war combined by the way)... where was i? oh yeah, there's no comparison. it's an evil (though crazy) ass who caused millions upon millions to die, vs. spoiled governor's son way too dumb for his position listening to douchebags like dick."
378,notsarc,oh yeah and then there is renegade by the styx... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iby32fcvtvs
379,notsarc,"i'm going to presume that you are a christian. why are you a christian? because you happened to have been brought up in a christian family. why aren't you a hindu? because you weren't born in india. if you were born in india, you'd be a hindu. if you were born in central africa, you'd be believing in strange mountain gods.  use your brain, however reassuring and pleasant it is, god does not exist.  oh yeah, and why won't god heal amputees?"
380,notsarc,"oh yeah, people think i'm a friend of my family's because i have none of their features. they all have brown hair, and i have blond. i have hazel eyes, and my family members have blue. which is slightly weird because most people who have blond hair have blue eyes."
381,notsarc,"oh yeah! i remember you man! welcome back. oh, thethinker may be gone but there's a few whack-jobs who have taken his place."
382,notsarc,"british kid with too much time on his hands. oh yeah, and he's a virgin."
383,notsarc,"oh yeah, outrage causes confusion, garchomp cant learn it except through cross breeding where the mother is garchomp so he is a garchomp, and the father is dragonite, haxorus, or salamance that knows outrage. and serperior cant learn hp ice because it doesn't exist unless you'd care to show how to get it."
384,notsarc,"oh yeah..., i saw that. they buried him in multiple little boxes ;)"
385,notsarc,oh yeah everytime you downvote someone you lose points so if you don't have that many you go into the negative.
386,notsarc,"oh yeahrubbish rubbish,scientifically speaking, human life (using a most bsic term) begins at conception. the twins exist as two seperate entities the moment each contains the individual human dna. seems to me you better be certain when it begins before you go around ending it. if you are driving at night an you ""think"" you might see a person ahead in the middle of the road you are hopefully not gonna drive over that person. Instead that uncertainty should lead you to stop. If you dont like that example, consider a hunter who is unsure what is in the bushes. "
387,notsarc,"oh yes, i see your point. and strictly speaking i suppose it is true. it is more of a language inflection issue. when you say people only have value for me to use them, it translates to me as if i only value people that i can use. when i talk about using someone, i mean the process by which you manipulate them to achieve your own goals with no regard to them or their well being. this is not how i treat people, and not the only requirement for me to value a person. it is true that i only value people to the extent that they enrich my life, but the ways in which they do that are many, varied, and very different. so yes, i understand what you are saying, i interpreted it in a different way is all."
388,notsarc,"oh yes they do i am being denied my rights under the 14th amendment by the state of michigan currently with the state of michigan refusing to acknowledge my iowa marriage licence, while acknowledging other iowa marriage licenses."
389,notsarc,"considering the dumbocrats have held the house (which initiates spending bills) for most of that time, then you have nothing but more hot air. oh yes he does. he'll let them get the bomb, knowing they want to wipe out israel. not very bright of him. is he an anti-semite?"
390,notsarc,"oh yes i know what i stated, so answer the nonsensical question 'with qm'. is quantum fluctuation nothing? at which point it ceases to be a quantum vacuum; which begs the question has a quantum vacuum been 'observed' much less scientifically saddled with the responsibility of generating virtual particles (i know the question is so obviously self-contradictory i could barely type it with a straight face). lol, yes i've heard; but as i'm sure you know i am sadly ignorant of any 'new logic', and what's more intend to never accept it without it being supported by the old which puts me in an inescapable situation. is the ripple effect of space time nothing?"
391,notsarc,"oh yes you have. if your memory fails you, i can repost your statements."
392,notsarc,oh yes this is all over the news in ireland. irish farmers are having a canary that its the end of ireland's sugar industry. and cereal too because of crop rotation. nobody seems to have even thought of the question as to why exactly the eu should pay for an unsustainable industry as oppossed to farmers moving into something profitable. edit: oh and its tied into something about sugar being one of irelands few natural resources. emoticonxbanghead
393,notsarc,oh yes i forgot there are some who believe that the property of free-will permeates the universe and is shared by all things animate or otherwise. there is a mathematical proof floating around someplace of it. but since i do not think that there is in fact such thing as free-will i have not bothered to collect it. humans do not have free-will simply because there is nothing for human will to be free of.
394,notsarc,"and you can thank the unions with their inflated wage/benefit packages they strongarmed from companies/municipalities for the high cost.  oh yes it is. new york is the only state where pbulic sector jobs, which bring little to no growth to an economy actually outpace the private sector. and you still think that heavy industry is the end-all be-all to economic survival?? america has a dynamic economy, not static."
395,notsarc,"oh yes we can. invoking god is not an explanation for ultimate origins, it's the papering over of the absence of an explanation by declaring further application of the question off limits. simply declaring that god's origin doesn't need explaining does not make that so."
396,notsarc,"oh yes, the rhubarb is one of my favorites too. a fine choice..you get a cake emoticonxbirthdaycake"
397,notsarc,"so in what way are the sperm and egg not human pray tell? are your sperm/eggs from some other species? are they lizard life? elephant life? what kind of life do they have (and you admit they do) outside of human life? sorry but sperm and egg are human and they are alive, how can you deny both statuses? oh yes if both sperm and egg are living matter then the claim 'life begins at conception' is patently false. i will assume you modify that phrase now to be 'human life begins at conception' but that is also clearly false on the face of it."
398,notsarc,oh yes i forgot to answer the key question: where does information come from. its a simple answer. from a local decrease in the degree of disorder. ie a reversal of local entropy. see adami for a development in mathematical and biological terms.
399,notsarc,"as i recall the order of feet was left front foot, right hind foot, left hind foot, and finally right front foot. does that make you happy. oh yes the genes involved are known as peds and numbered in order 1-4. ped1 and ped4 are mirror images of each other (obtained by a process known as reflective copy) and ped2 and ped3 are much the same. this is of course entirely logical and could have been directed or random. the first critter to bear such feet was known as the ftse not to be confused with the index. its predecessors were of course the gimpy series since they had 1,2, or 3 feet and had to hobble along with what they had. ftse-1 is sometimes known as pogo because of its odd 'gait'."
400,notsarc,"marriage is social support. the government, in supporting marriage, is giving social support to certain relationships covered by marriage.  you argue marriage should be left up to the culture institutions such as churches, government should only do the paper work. that's an acknowledgment of the current social role of government recognized marriage. you don't want government to provide that social support, suddenly, now that it will include gays. oh yes, it speaks to the cultural relevence of government-recognized marriage. people would not feel sufficiently compelled to change the constitution over a matter of meaningless government paperwork which has no social relevence."
401,notsarc,"is also text found in the same article. well think about it have we not seen remoliding of society in the last few years with regard to family structure, economic organization, and social practices? did not the republicans run on the platform of remolding society in their image? tax cuts for the rich, attacks on the middle class, ignoring scientific resarch in favor of conservative values, turing off stem cell research, ignoring global warming data, switch back to favoring big iron industries like oil instead of continuing to catalyze high tech energy solutions, and of course last and not least starting foreign imperial wars pre-emptetively. oh yes lots of remodling going on there."
402,notsarc,"well there is also trade with indians, customs collections from imports, and the patent office and of course the passing of laws and legislation to implement the whole thing. oh yes lets not forget legal tender which is mentioned i think. and also elections."
403,notsarc,"do away with scholarships, too. oh yes. humans have a natural desire to learn. are ever learning.  besides, you don't need two to three years to prepare for these exams, nor do you need a public high school to help you prepare for them. teachers must assess all the time in order to teach. the issue there is not grades, but assessment. the appropriate methods varying, for different teachers. you believe that, because you don't know anything else."
404,notsarc,"oh yes, president obama also has to figure out how to get rid of the bush policy of lies and falseness bush people burrowed into the federal government by bush during his last days as president in order to thwart the spread of science, research and reality."
405,notsarc,"take another look. we certainly do have our hands firmly on the levers of power. sixty us senators, a substantial majority in the house, a president who represents the death of reaganism once and for all. a solidly pro-choice president and congress. a president and a congress who understand that each of us is responsible for all the rest of us. oh yes, this country will emerge from the bush depression and the optional bush wars with a new sense of direction and a new prosperity. by the next election, there will be so few congressional republicans that they can caucus in the mens' room - provided, of course, that larry craig has not returned for a visit and is using it for other purposes. the naysayers can either get on the train or get left at the station.emoticonxsmilie"
406,notsarc,"oh yes you can, the 'eternal word of god' is malleable; what do you think the clergy are for? four centuries ago they would have burned a gay person at the stake if it was certain. now they are 'disordered' but it's now a 'delicate' matter."
407,notsarc,"Abortion is about pregnancy - and whether or a not a woman wants to be or can sustain a pregnancy - physically, emotionally and economically.Nobody has to be a parent. That is why there is adoption, safe-haven laws, the signing away of parental rights - and oh yes, an ever growing population of dead beat dads.I am still waiting to see proof of all the mourning dads due to women having abortions. Most of those women are desperate and alone - or have the blessing of the father. "
408,notsarc,reckon you don't know much about christianity then.  when you can bust the resurrection of jesus christ then you might have something to argue about. until then your claim that christianity is untrue is simply a lot of hot air.
409,notsarc,"reckon you'll get an education in time that turning your back on jesus christ wasn't one of your better moves. there's still time to come to your senses, though."
410,notsarc,"um, if the critter in question meets all the sensual criteria i cited, i ain't gonna call it an elephant. reckon my empirical observations trump your philosophical maunderings."
411,notsarc,and i say you and everyone who denies christ is steeped in folly. reckon you'll see the errors of your reckless judgment in due time.
412,notsarc,"again you show your ignorance of 1st century jewish tradition/mishnah. a husband and wife are betrothed to each other for a year or so before they are actually married according to the jewish law. that explains why mary was still a virgin in the first place. in our culture they were referred to as married, but she was in fact promised to joseph so they were more like engaged according to our way of thinking.  and why are you completely ignoring the previous post as you always do? you ask a question, just ignore the answer, and then ask another question, or just make a disconnected comment. have you no response to the information i've already given you? for example, have you no answer for the modern jews problem in determining the promised genealogy of any self professed messiah that comes forth today, or in the future?"
413,notsarc,that explains figure 6 of the following? its a flood zone of a riverbed? how about other areas where there are trees growing through 2 separate coal seams? google image result for http://www.grisda.org/origins/images/24017-12.jpg this helps make my point about review of evolutionary books. my personal review of this small part of some book explaining how the petrified forest came to be because of a riverbed elsewhere is a big thumbs down. if that is the best you got i am looking elsewhere for answers. shame on you for accepting that from your evolutionary high priest. can you even see that no explanation was given?
414,notsarc,"that explains it, post 60, page 4. look what comes up for me. i have my forums settings at 40 posts per page. post 121 which came up was the first post at the top of the page.  regarding ip's, the region/part of the country or world they are from can be determined, so i'll make you an additional offer; if he shows that both easyrider and my ip's are located in the same town in nh, i'll still agree to being banned. i say this not knowing where rider is from but i assume he doesn't live in my state."
415,notsarc,mexico? that explains many things. mexico: candidates must address murders of women | human rights watch
416,notsarc,humans don't just have sex for procreation. humans have sex for pleasure. that explains the evolution of the clitoris and the bundle of nerves underneath the head of the penis.
417,notsarc,you fill your mind with the prattlings of glenn beck and rush limbaugh? that explains your character problem.
418,notsarc,Well that explains your anger.:p I hope you are blessed with homeliness.:) Makes your commitment easier to keep. How old are you now? 
419,notsarc,"Hello, please read http://www.reasons.org/resources/apo...ing.shtml?mainIt is a good christian site that explains that there are lots of problems with Dr Russell Humphreys' hypothesis.The universe and Earth are very old. We know this as a fact. Why would God lie to us? If the Universe looks old, then it is. To claim otherwise is to call God a liar. "
420,notsarc,"oh, so you can point out where i argued that birds were the apex species? no? what a shock you're right, right now, humans are the apex species. but (and i know you don't get this part), we are not the most evolved. all extant species are equally as evolved."
421,notsarc,"final, switzerland 1 spain 0. spain, one of the favorites or perhaps the favorite to win the world cup, loses to switzerland. what a shocker. of course with two more matches for all teams in this group anything can happen, but the pressure is on spain. they can not afford to lose another game, even a tie could mean not getting to the round of sixteen.emoticonxwow"
422,notsarc,wow. talk about condoning brainswashing. kids are being taught it's ok to be gay. they're not fairly allowed to make their own decisions. if they were given a fair chance of making their own decision i can gaurantee you it would be no where near that percentage.
423,notsarc,"wow, your quite vicious aren't you? i didn't call obama osama. that's mentally ill. i just said that is one freaky fact. mostly a joke, you know...those haha things.. wouldn't demoguy make you sound like you make or use demos =p"
424,notsarc,wow..its very informative and inspirational stuff i think...great works...keep it up...lloyd claycomb
425,notsarc,"wow. that is true. i'd say 16 and up, since a lot of people that are my age and below are pretty dumb, but then i myself couldn't participate in this site, and i like all the different points of view i get to see by being apart of it."
426,notsarc,"really? wow! my parents did the same thing! we had a water-cooler bottle that my dad put change into for years, and when we were little kids we went to cash it in, all of us helping to roll the hundreds of pounds of coins, and it ended up being worth over $900! ever since then, i've been a coin fanatic. people are so quick to throw away change. my friends know that i'll always take a nickel or a few pennies if they don't want to carry them around."
427,notsarc,bwhahahaha! now you are so arrogant as to think you can make up your own words? wow! what an idiot!
428,notsarc,"wow, thats pretty cool, not that i can afford it or anything. and i doubt it will be as common as the regular car is.  i'm serious about the broccoli though, you would think with all the amazing technology on this planet we could find a way to make healthy food taste good. instead we are making unhealthy food taste like crap.  think about it, broccoli is one of the most healthy foods on the planet, if you ate a full serving of broccoli every day it would increase your longevity by years. now imagine if it tasted just like hershey's milk chocolate."
429,notsarc,"why would it be immoral to lie to your child about santa clause? wow. you really are bad at this.... you're presupposing your position that harm is what is immoral. if the lie is to a person the person is the victim of that lie. you're presupposing your position..... you said that a victim is one that has been harmed, then you say that lying makes one a victim, but then you say that lying to your kids about santa is not immoral? i'm done with you."
430,notsarc,"really? i think war is one of those things the world absolutely learns nothing from. i mean, we're still fighting, so what exactly are we learning? to use a better and bigger gun? to make more disguisable spy planes? to train the military men more efficiently? wow. but in the end, does it all ever really solve anything? not in my opinion."
431,notsarc,"wow - sounds like a terrible idea. luckily we didn't all lock in on one belief while we thought the earth was flat and the center of the solar system, etc. why is that a terrible idea? if you logically look at all the beliefs only one of them can be true. by the rules of logic, if one is true the others are false. you can make the claim that you think they are all false but then you support the idea that your belief is true and the others are false so you're really in the same boat. that does not mean that you shouldn't be tolerant but tolerance does not require that you accept everything to be true."
432,notsarc,"money cant fix your problems at all you think that they can but they cant. i think that it can because money has fixed all of my problems.  come on! give me an answer to what can't money fix? leys say your one of those people that would die. how would you feel. i would feel however i was feeling before i died. in the debates hypothetical i wouldn't even know that i was going to die. many things are wrong with killing why cant you see that? wow! there are many things? to back up your assertion, list 5 of these things for me."
433,notsarc,"wow, what a cool suggestion! yes, this has happened to me before. thank you for the idea! would the individual clarify in the debate itself or in a separate argument/posting?"
434,notsarc,"wow, i didn't know it was that young! so there's no problem with porn stuff at 16 either."
435,notsarc,realy hellno? you downvote me for no damn reason? wow.
436,notsarc,wow. i can't believe they block it. it's not like facebook or porn. it's actually educational (sort of.) haha
437,notsarc,"wow, about a year and a half ago i was in your exact same position. i too was raised catholic but i felt questions about my faith. i eventually chose to become an atheist. i will not try to influence your decision, because ones own personal beliefs are just that: personal. whether you choose to remain a catholic, or become and agnostic or atheist i hope you will remain tolerant of others beliefs."
438,notsarc,"wow :) i'm just a starter, that's my first big tattoo (the debate picture, sorry about the glare, i had another sitting friday and it was lathered in tattoo goo!) i've had 5 hours on it so far, still got so long left but it's going to be a 3/4 sleeve once finished."
439,notsarc,"wow, it's really rare to see someone admit to changing their mind about an issue. definitely deserves an upvote."
440,notsarc,"wow, you got into stock trading with just $100? i had always imagined you'd need quite a lot of money to start out, so i never tried. i'm going to read up on this now ^^"
441,notsarc,"wow that's an excellent bit of knowledge. i didn't know that about the ps updates, i only had 1 and 2 and i felt like the hassle of continually buying a new one was not worth the free internet. also, as for the red ring of death on xbox, i guess i wasn't an extreme enough gamer to let mine over heat."
442,notsarc,"then prove me wrong. you want respect? then earn it. i'll give it to you if you stop meaninglessly attack me with your insults. i'm serious, i'll calm down the second you start delivering real arguments. and 'standard atheist attacks'? wow. you're so close minded, aren't you?"
443,notsarc,"wow, if you honestly believe that then you have been brainwashed by fear mongering and propaganda and you dont think for yourself, how does religion not do that? anyone who uses religion as an excuse for violence is extremely misled and should rethink their views, that doesnt mean religion itself is bad."
444,notsarc,"wow if this is what our society believes, that enlightenment is not important, well then i feel sorry for the age that i have been born into, if you would rather be kept in the dark, thats up to you, i like to be in the light of wisdom"
445,notsarc,wow i didn't know you were going to calculate that! well its true i do earn a lot of points a day and join and participate in a lot of debates in a day. also my 2nd year being here is coming up soon!
446,notsarc,"wow. just because people believe in god or claim so does not mean they have or use god as their moral compass. the god, i assume we are talking about the christian god, does not promote war and if we are to actualy follow what this god teaches and use god as our moral compass we would not go to war, but most people do not follow god as their moral compass and thus do go to war."
447,notsarc,wow what an awkward discussion. there is obviously no reason to sterilize when they are sexually retarded as opposed to mentally retarded and even then mentally retarded can have non mentally retarded children and some of them are able to take care of their offspring depending up the severity of their condition.
448,notsarc,"wow, 'stupid, selfish, anti-american'  i'm guessing you have something to back up such bold statements? or are you just talking out of your ass again?"
449,notsarc,"wow... you are bent on harping on creationists arguments at whatever the cost.first of all, you are not even considering that the majority of people are misinformed of what evolution is not because they have creationist motives, but because they go to the dictionary for definitions "
450,notsarc,insult? i'm not sure if you're joking or just have a bad memory. but you have been making false assumptions 'aka' insulting me also. i'm not trying to insult you. i'm simply dishing out just like you are buddy. and i don't have to back up anything to a stranger i'll never meet. i know how successful i am and what degrees i have. all these false assumptions you're coming up with aren't phasing me at all. stop dishing out if you cant take it.
451,notsarc,"you seem to be lost in our jokes, you have to tell people you're joking so they know. and you got the punctuation wrong, in the russian phrase. the only way for it not to sound insane in russian, would be to put it as: '___ _ __. __'. calling someone '__', means things are serious, and you're ready for a fight. if you claim it to be a joke, you're just insane. so i assume that you got the punctuation wrong, and it was your signature."
452,notsarc,"you're joking, right? supporting tradition family values means devaluing any other type of family. by doing this, millions of lgbt individuals are denied equal rights. you cannot support heterosexual family structure and be apathetic toward gay rights at the same time. supporting heteronormitive ideals goes completely against giving equal civil rights to all gays."
453,notsarc,'whose illegal war? america isn't even there to be at war anymore!' wow. please tell me you're joking?
454,notsarc,"holy shi- what now?! i hope that was satirical of you, because while they should be punished, no one deserves the death penalty, especially children! they're just spoiled brats who'll grow out of that phase when they grow up. saying they should die is probably the most psychopathic thing i've heard in a while. unless you're joking. in which case, forgive my outburst."
455,notsarc,"pro-choice is a sexist concept. it only applies to women. pro-choice doesn't give you much of a choice. it sounds like what you're saying is that anything that has to do with only one gender, is sexist. if not, please clarify.  pro choice does give you a choice. you can either continue the pregnancy, or seek an abortion.  the pro life argument eliminates abortion and mandates that you continue the pregnancy (barring rape, etc).  if you're joking, then ignore this."
456,notsarc,"you're joking right? that's not even close. here's the verse just in case you read something else, i'll give you the benefit of the doubt with that: 1 corinthians 13:3: if i give away all i have, and if i deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, i gain nothing. this does not mean 'but not loved for it', but showing love."
457,notsarc,"i think in the mind of a psychopath with boundary issues, what the woman was wearing, or where she was at does not matter at all. how do you explain people who get raped in their homes? how about people who aren't dressing slutty, they're just having a drink with a friend, but that friend turns out to have a darkside? i really hope you're joking though."
458,notsarc,"i really hope you're joking. extremism is a disease, but not religion. religion can be, and is, for the most part, peaceful."
459,notsarc,i sincerely hope you're joking and not just an idiot for saying that i'm wrong for agreeing with myself.
460,notsarc,"i really, really, really hope you're joking. i point out that your bible is full of racist, sexist, abusive, psychopathic, perverted shit, and instead of arguing back, you just call me names. writing an entire paragraph in capitals does not make it right."
461,notsarc,"i don't know if you're joking or not but you made me laugh, thank you :)"
462,notsarc,"i'm pretty sure you're joking... but still, if one has the power to acquire and manipulate knowledge sufficiently well, then one can learn to protect himself from bombs and such. my house was recently afflicted by ants. massive amounts of ants. yet their numbers did not amount to much after the strategic placement of a few of these."
463,notsarc,your dispute seems like a very uneducated answer. does the wink mean that you're joking?
464,notsarc,"yeah even i have to agree you were making a joke. i may not agree with your stances on things, but i can see when you're joking."
465,notsarc,"okay, at least you gave an example for reagan. i personally think the russians were on the decline long before the end of the cold war, and reagan happened to be president when they finally fell, but we can agree to disagree. for bush i hope you're joking, because it has been quite clear that his policies have more than likely created more terrorists than he has helped defeat (not to mention the numerous other bad things he's done as president). in fact the only really good thing that came out of bush's presidency was that his unpopularity paved the way for obama to become president."
466,notsarc,"1. you're kidding, right? have you never watched c-span and listened to congressional inquiries? it's all q&a;and fact driven. 2. you have the chance to clear that up (about your denials) yourself."
467,sarc,"PROJECTION, again.... I'm amazed you can't recognise the amount you do it.... "
468,sarc,Your correct the research is sound and the conclusions are accurate. I am impressed you came to this conclusion without even reading it. 
469,sarc,"I can't believe that you would attempt to make such an insane assertion. Clearly, God was speaking about homosexual sex, but I'm not surprised that you left out the most unambiguous scriptural references. emoticonXRolleyes "
470,sarc,"what?!?!?! blasphemy!!!! where would i get my cd fodder from? fw: fw: fw: in the subject line is what keeps the points rolling in! without it, there would be no j.c.! how can you be so callous and insensitive?"
471,sarc,yeah you do a bunch of talking but mostly everything you say is meaningless banter. another troll eh? check. this site has many.
472,sarc,"that sounds a lot like another species... what is it called... oh, right, humans! have no predators to fear? check. grown high in numbers? check. a danger to all other animals and humans alike? check. so, here's an easy way to curb the numbers... let's hunt them!"
473,sarc,"really? damn! i wanna be awesome too. are you selling awesomeness or do i have to develop it on my own? if it's a lot of work, i might just settle on being mediocre."
474,sarc,"did you not read this part of the debate: as long as we are not harming anyone else so, no smoking, no drinking, no drugging? damn! what else do you have to do on that tiny little cold ass island you live on? lol"
475,sarc,so ridiculous =point whore? damn. your level of logic is astounding.
476,sarc,"Oh, yea. You are damn right those European socialists are dangerous. Americans might look and see their governments actually doing something USEFUL for the people and think that we should have that here.  I am surprised we have not nuked them yet. "
477,sarc,Those damn black people! All wanting respect and equal opportunity! They should just be happy with what they got!Why should they work for the same pay? They are just selfish! [/end sarcasm] This argument is tired *yawn* 
478,sarc,"Clearly you don't give a damn, because if you did then you would have to admit that you were wrong. Does this mean that you think the introduction of speed limits is a bad idea? "
479,sarc,"Aww, he is just confused. He has nothing to offer and when he first read the topic he XXX-umed that it was going to be a discussion of his noggin. The last thing we need is a damn limey board nanny. Play the ball old chap and not the man - famous limey quote "
480,sarc,You betcha. Even JP who usually can defend such stuff has failed. VOR doesn't even bother (not surpisingly consider it requires brain usage)   The mere fact they let him do that is damning aganist the Vatican. 
481,sarc,"oh, darling, doesn't it? if you are, as i believe, 'black', and conservative (heaven help you), to accept and embrace the republican platform, you essentially have sold your birthright down the proverbial river, because republicans care nothing for your black derriere, and would enslave you, all over again, if only they could.  you completely overlook 'white privilege', which dictates that a white person could be homeless, dirty, uneducated, drug-addled, and or criminal, and he would get a pass before you would, simply because of the color of his skin.  you've drunk the koolaid, and can't discern ca ca from truth.  and so you've joined with the white racists and pointed fingers at me, because i upset the applecart, and the status quo, and refuse to bend or mind.  again i ask....are you white? hispanic? asian? or black? not a trick question."
482,sarc,"youre not an idiot because you are black, you are just an idiot, sweetplums you believe that white people were created by a black scientist called yakub. anyone who believes this xxxx is a racist with the intelligence of a child.....seems to define you perfectly. you can shove the 1st amendment up you flabby arse. this is a worldwide forum...yes there is a whole world outside of the sexual deviant communities of texas. deal with it darling"
483,sarc,"bwaaaaaahahahahahaha!!! man this is funny. 'the joys of pregnancy'. that's rich!  you start out with constant peeing and projectile vomiting and when all is said and done you get to be practically ripped in two while you pass something that is 10 times the size of the orafice it is passing out of. but by the end of nine months you don't even fear the pain of child-birth as all you can think is 'get it out'!!!!!!!! for up until then you wobble, get your pelvis kicked the **** out of by the little darling, you swell, get constipated, pray for a confortable position to sleep in, develop vericose veins, stretch marks, and hemroids. hate to kill the romantic image, but even if you are really excited to be a parent and really, really want your baby - pregnancy sucks."
484,sarc,"mutzie, darling, is it absolutely necessary for a warrior to run with an m240 bravo while under fire, and also carrying a 70-pound pack. surely, warfare can be competently sized down so that 80-females can be deadly."
485,sarc,"<sarcasm mode on> it's sexual assault because when she sobered up and realized what she'd done, the little darling couldn't possibly have been responsible for her own actions.  <sarcasm mode off>"
486,sarc,"that darling, depends on the ceo. :) i have met more than my fair share who did little more than take up space. i have also worked with senior leaders who kicked butt. what's interesting tho - is that in addition to driving results, they were the ones that valued their employees and were loved in return. personally i suspect it has something to do with them knowing how the work gets done.  (i also wonder how many ceos would diss the janitor if suddenly nobody would clean the can for them.....) in any case - i know enough about business to know that it is annoying and expensive to have to replace any employee. especially a good one. your elitism is so cute. sad, but cute."
487,sarc,"judeau, my christian science darling! where have you been? my faith rests upon you!"
488,sarc,watch out ez.dani thinks that you responding to my posts constitutes that you ' hang around' with people like me. we wouldnt want to make the little darling cry again lol.
489,sarc,"your reputation  la savoir faire with dirty notes precedes you, darling. no need for mommy's little boy to wiggle down his pants and expose himself some more. meaning, too, your ignorance, not mine, since the connection between the vietnam war, rubber production and american tire manufacturers is documented and known. go visit your local c.i.a. source for further information, dw, for starters.  be sure to take your teacher clown nosey with you."
490,sarc,"simone darling .the mans sperm creates the fetus with the ovum(or is it ova?) did no one tell you that? the subject is not about the fetus holders( we cannot say mother because the pregnant woman is not..by your definition..a mother) personal risk. if you are saying that only the people involved in a situation should have control of the situation you are opening a rather large can of worms. you may believe that a woman can deliberately destroy a sentient potential human but others may disagree. as a young nurse, nadine witnessed the horror of late abortions. now an mp, she says the law must be changed | mail online"
491,sarc,"oh, and i would rather die than be your 'darling', butthole."
492,sarc,"the entire purpose to my life is for you to think of me as being oh-so-cute. glad to see you accept your raison d'tre. side note idea: raisin d'tre oatmeal cookies, tagline 'they are your reason to be.' why am i a quasi-anarchist? the government is evil. will anarchism ever happen in north america? if so, not for an extremely long time. the bilderberg group wouldn't allow it. i'm going to pinch your cheeks for making such a darling argument!"
493,sarc,you don't see me making similar knee-jerk reactions. woopdee fucking doo. but people should have a choice who they spend the rest of their life with. well done darling. but being an american you should know that in marriage people choose who they spend the next couple of years with not the rest of their lives. now let's get back to the facts - where in an arranged marriage does it say the 2 people getting arranged don't have a choice?
494,sarc,"Sweetie, if every gay person were as wealthy as Mary Cheney, we could laugh all the way to the bank and ignore the prejudice in society the way she does. Indeed, we'd probably be the darlings of the GOP. Unfortunately for your delusion, gays are no more or less wealthy on average than anyone else. "
495,sarc,"My dear Sigma, I'd tutor you in logic if I thought it would stick. Notwithstanding anything that has been said before in this thread, are no better than is not interchangeable with equally as bad or worse than simply because are no better than does not imply that the thing following than is bad at all...while equally as bad or worse than does. Changing what a person says in an argument is a strawman technique used by many a poor debater. You wanted to get 'equality' into the argument where none was ever implied. Good day! "
496,sarc,"That, my dear sir, is exactly the level of maturity I expect from you guys. :) A fine moderator you are, to be sure. "
497,sarc,"i can't help it if fairy tales are dear to your heart dude, i'm just telling it like it is.  christians all over the country try to claim the gospels are in harmony..and very rarely , if ever, have i found a christian who will admit the contradictions in the bible. they try to explain away contradictions with lies and made up versions of their own but will never admit the truth.... no loss here, i have never since i came here hid the fact i do not like religion. it's nothing personal against anyone in particular, but if you happen to be religious and fall under the weight of truth i can't help if your feelings get hurt. would you rather me feed you a line of xxxx so you will fall for it, i mean come on, religion already did that right>.....emoticonxbouncer"
498,sarc,"speaking of dear, kindly, old moses, (sorry, i mean charlton heston,) and truths, half-truths and downright lies. does anyone know that a few years ago, the australian foreign minister had to lodge a formal protest against the good mr heston's portrayal of australia as (quote) 'the most violent society on earth'. heston and the nra claimed this to be the result of newly introduced gun restrictions in australia?  homicides per million - usa 57 australia 18 which would you say comes close to being the most violent society? leo"
499,sarc,not likely waxy: i just thought snakespit's scornful post would have been more effective if he hadn't used 'dear' three times when he meant 'deer'.
500,sarc,"he didn't, he said 'oh dear'. to have called you 'dear' clive14 would have typed 'look dear' or perhaps even 'my dear'.  what he actually called you a head case, a point that you appear to miss completely. makes me wonder how much you are paying attention to what we say emoticonxconfused"
501,sarc,"dear god.you really haven't a clue about what your talking about.away with the birdies i think.yousef was responsible for the 93 bombing,and he himself had very broad associations with some of the al-qaeda hardcore(osama said he didn't know him and was in sudan while yousef stayed in peshewer).osama wasn't responsible for the 93 bombing,he wasn't responsible for bali and madrid and i don't care what the world media tells you.but by all means keep spouting your misinformation,i for one find it hilarious. the yousef-osama-saddam link is a conspiracy theory."
502,sarc,"oh but he/ she is. his often speaks out to remind our dear mps that they are supposed to be leaders of our country, not school kids a playground. he does this by yelling 'order!' a lot. and he gets to wear a silly wig i think (or is that 'black rod'?) (ps, wilted_laughter is irish i think. your post sort of implies you think him english. calling an irishman 'english' is a crime even more serious than calling someone a 'liberal' in the usa :p)"
503,sarc,"i'm doomed. yes, i love lobster, shrimp and even the impure oyster and other mollusks, i may be innocent of wearing linen and wool together but i can't be sure!!! doomed!!! oh, dear god, i'm doomed!!!!!"
504,sarc,"dear lisa, i want to tell you you're hot. hot as in every way possible. in fact, you should eat some peyote while you dance the tarantella. the way you smell like a goddess in heat makes me want to email you and ask you if you would consider this proposition: if you'll remove that top button i would have enough nerve to plop my large foot down, showing the massive wart to you. do you like warts? i hope so. there's this longing"
505,sarc,"just print out your own posts, my dear james. they'll say it all for me! emoticonxangel"
506,sarc,"maybe you should subtitle this thread: the right to a school with perfect parents. but that's not public education. you sound as extreme as the people who don't want gay parents in their schools. well, go ahead, dear. have fun tearing each other apart."

509,sarc,"anyone clueless enough to think that anyone chooses a sexual orientation is probably not being honest with their own feelings. so tell us, my dear... when did you choose not to be a big old homo? and what tempted you to be one? a temptation you bravely chose to refuse? how did it happen for you? inquiring minds want to know, because none of us have experienced anything so outrageously bizarre."

515,sarc,"oh dear god, marry me! just kidding, i agree. ."
516,sarc,"oh dear pagan, i would grab my sword of jesus and slice your head off, put it on a pole and await the next foolish rebellion against the glorious kingdom of god almighty!"
517,sarc,"no.. go read the bible before you look dumber than you already do. sorry dear, ad hominems do nothing. it sounds like you're talking about something you know little about. i apologize i sound that way. i certainly know what i am referring to in the bible, and knowing that you have admitted you don't necessarily follow the whole bible (god > bible) i figured i wouldn't assume you believed in genesis adam and eve. but rather give you the option to say yes or no.  god didn't want us to be puppets.  i didn't necessarily say puppets. he wanted us to have free will, to do what we wanted -and if they did love him, it should be their choice. if sin wasn't created, we would have been god's puppets. so god was performing some twisted reverse psychology on adam and eve?"
518,sarc,"or maybe he's the second coming and god will get pissed and destroy the earth when he's defeated! dear lord, it all makes sense now."
519,sarc,"if i were a virgin it wouldn't insult me that you called me such a meaningless terminology. ignoring that nonsensical 'insult', i shall simply call you a man-whore and move along. as for the answer to the question, i will ask you why you try so hard to contribute constructively to a website that rewards you with nothing. oh dear, man-whore, that 'virgin' just burst your ego, what will you ever do?"
520,sarc,"oh dear she's attacking everyone now obviously a very unhappy kitten .... and i can't even pray for her...and if you can't take tantrum throwing stop doing it, try work on that new word you have invented or your punctuation and spelling , or print up your global warming theory prove all them science folk wrong .... may even get a noble prize ( beats beauty school) ... go get them tiger ....,."
521,sarc,good grief... satanist?!.. my goodness how can you say such a thing?!  i will have to ban you for even mentioning the concept of it! my dear old fellow!
522,sarc,"yes, that is certainly going to stop you from a gunman. 'dear god.... please save this soul'"
523,sarc,and how do you know for certain provocateaur dearie? what evidence are you using to show that gaydom is different from a chemically based addiction to a drug substance? and what evidence is there that a person can't quit being gay and start being straight if they want to?
524,sarc,"whatever you need to tell yourself in order to accept being a subject of the government winston dearie. if you believe you're happier in a country home to the deadliest of snakes and spiders and can't even own a gun because somebody decided your fate for you long ago then who are we to argue? we'll run our country our way, your let your country run your life its way, and we'll stay out of each other's business and stop trying our country as having the better idea. hope you like being alone, bankrupt and dingo bit."
525,sarc,winston dearie before you decide to go flapping your gums at me over something you don't like i'd suggest you take the test first and see for yourself. the pictures are extremely stereotyped to the point of being racist caricatures that were popular in the early half of the 20th century.
526,sarc,"tell me something winston dearie, who's teeth marks are on the headboard at night; yours or the dingo's?"
527,sarc,"not really dearie, you're just ssdd. you're not unique or even all that intellegent. you just follow the crowd because you haven't an original thought in your head. but that's ok, we don't blame you, per se, we know you can't control your behavior. emoticonxrolleyes"
528,sarc,"where were you when we discussed this twice previously?  nice slur, good way to show your false 'compassion' emoticonxcry depends where it hits. two to the center and one to the head is the accepted protocol. i posted dr. fackler's, the leading authority on 'wounds', previously. did you miss it and the miami dade shooting events? scroll back dearie."
529,sarc,"let's see if i understand you correctly, because i think you may be on to something incredibly insightful. let's see, the island with males and females, uh, can reproduce, and, ... uh,  eureka, i've got it!!! you need a male and female to sexually reproduce!!!! that's ingenious!!!! you're brilliant, cool spot!! you're forgetting one thing. the island without the gay guys would not be nearly as fabulous."
530,sarc,"so christian morality concludes that a woman turning around out of curiousity merits death, and that slavery is a-okay. fantastic. have fun in your crazy cult."
531,sarc,'some people just need killin'' - that sounds just fantastic!
532,sarc,yeah that would be fantastic if they came back... and killed tens of millions more people. that would be fantastic!!!! thanks for that... just because ;)
533,sarc,"oh, usa is a fiiiiiiiiine one to tell 'make love, not war.' to our fantastic nation!"
534,sarc,"it looks like you have tried to analize everything i say as being 'my' life experiences. i really enjoy your abuse , i would love to meet up with you some day. my life is fantastic actually. i dont know why i have to keep repeating that. what about those in haiti right now ? what about others? i think they are more important than your fucking sulking over the americans lousy pronunciations.or me whining over you being an arsehole. as for amy winehouse , no reputable establishment would dare touch the skank."
535,sarc,how could you?! :'( all i wanted was to contribute to a fantastic community of geniuses!
536,sarc,That has to be a typo my friend. If you can compress the EB into only 1012 bits then you can write your own ticket in the field of data compression! Lets see 100 million pages into 1012 bits - fantastic - please tell us how. I really would like to put the entire literature of mankind (and more) on an Ipod. 
537,sarc,"oh hun i am sorry, i'll get right on that :) but yes i retouched her scars, she's a cutter for sure..."
538,sarc,"i don't hide behind anyone: i'm content to learn from hume: i've never mentioned locke. i have explained my position several times; you have chosen to reply with venomous accusations of 'hypocrisy' (sniffing out my contribution to another thread in order to draw mach's attention to it with a poodle's alacrity).  have you studied hard to become proficient in sneering, or are you naturally gifted that way ? why don't you just put me on your ignore list and save yourself the trouble of, as you put it, 'accommodating' me with your superior intellect ? i am surprised that you should wish to continue any conversation with someone you appear to despise. ps. i couldn't give a monkey's about your infatuation with attila the hun."
539,sarc,"cute. but it misses the point. your rationale is like saying hadrian's wall is mis-named because hadrian wasn't out there putting or the rocks in place, but merely caused it to be made. i know the followers of many great leaders hid their leaders burial sites. for want of a better example i can think of attila the hun who was buried in a river 'somewhere'."
540,sarc,psh if i had to f*&^ hillary i'd cheat too! i mean i'm gay but lord have mercy! lol... but getting back to the subject at hand. simone hun honestly just stop with the cook theories and whoever else even believes them. bush and dick had no idea of 9/11 we all didn't.  i find it a sad irony that we discover the warning signs after the incident... we're only human and we all make mistakes... oh and fyi we did not land on the moon.. simone told me it was made of cheese and that there were giant moon rats eating and eating until one day the moon will be gone... that's why there are holes in it. it's true!!! honestly!
541,sarc,i know! i should totally be sorry and ashamed for being such a horrible liar... i mean a dick sucking homosexual and a liar! oh i'm going to the seventh circle for sure... except one little tidbit easilyridden. i didn't lie!!!  embarrass? hun you forget who wears the tiara in this forum....
542,sarc,i'm absolutely astonished that you can't even see what this debate is about. i guess this is because of your disabilitiss though.. i should try and be understanding....
543,sarc,"1868 actually, that is a link to the wikipedia article on the act. once again, the 14th amendment and the civil rights act of 1964 are not the same thing. more importantly, a store saying 'no blacks allowed' is not violating the 14th, they violate the civil rights act of 1964. furthermore, a store saying 'no guns allowed' is not violated the 2nd amendment.  time for you to read up on the constitution doc, you might find some good things in there. i'm a little surprised you don't vote democrat given your thoughts. then again, not much difference between a given democrat and your texas 'republicans' (see w bush and rick perry)"
544,sarc,"first of all, let me just say that that is an excellent whitesnake song. but i'm a little surprised!emoticonxwow all the complaints i got about giving out my personal problems and here you are complaining about wanting a relationship. does no one else see the irony in this? the problem is obvious to me. okay i take that back, it really isn't. does going to kichen supply stores really help?"
545,sarc,"i'm always astonished that creationists try the 'lots of cultures have stories about floods' gambit.  yes, lots of cultures have stories about many things. either there was one great flood at one time, or there have been individual floods. since humans tend to congregate in river valleys, i think i know why all the flood stories contradict each other..."
546,sarc,"i'm always blown away by the irony of seeing fundamentalists claim to grasp 'absolute truth.' nothing could be more blasphemous, by their own definitions: they place themselves in the position they ordinarily reserve for god. and then they accuse atheists of theological arrogance?!? please."
547,sarc,"were it so simple. for the agents to 'freely assemble' among us they, or their superiors, must conclude that we are some sort of threat. would that make you feel loved? on a side note, i'm always surprised at how 'conservatives', normally so worried about government waste, take such a waste of taxpayer dollars so glibly. fbi investigating kiss-ins? joining subversive 'terrorist' xxxx biker groups?"
548,sarc,"i'm amazed none of them have pounced on my comments yet, they have been strangely quiet. maybe their counting their ammo and preparing for revolution."
549,sarc,i've just finished reading your contributions to this thread and i'm astonished by the sheer bombast of their tone and the sciolism in their content. why don't you just make succinct and logical points without the 'support' of a ridiculous apparatus of phoney scholarship ?
550,sarc,"quote from johnhanks: 'quote: originally posted by inri ...sex is nothing but animalistic until it is practiced in accordance with the eucharist...  i'm fascinated. how is this done, exactly? (and just for the record - you're really saying making sex less animalistic is a good thing?)' i wouldn't even ask!!"
551,sarc,"the moon is made of cheese because i said so. was i persuasive? neither were you. do you have the capability to actually debate with facts? you saying something is true doesn't make it so. oh, and i'll save you the trouble.. i'm going to burn in hell, i'm, how does it go? spiritually challenged? and oh yeah, i'm going to bring about something called rapture or something like that. lol"
552,sarc,"you can't justify your claims but you can jump onto a bandwagon of fallacy in a hearbeat? and you're a moral representative of your mythology? i'm hardly surprised. just so you don't make such a mistake again: any claim i make with regards to a 'bible' is done as a work of fiction, or midly historical account of natural, human activities on earth. i hope that's clear. if i claim the bible has a word on a particular page, this is reasoning through logic. if you claim god exists because it's written in the bible, on the other hand. this would be an example of....well, to put it lightly...fallacy...circular reasoning. (insanity also comes to mind). -mach"
553,sarc,"well geeze pyg...i knew you were a bit itchy but i didn't know you hated gay people! i also didn't know you owned the 'internetz!' you must be related to al gore...how much did he soak you for his invention, lol? i don't know if you realized it but i'm gay too. yes indeedy little pyggy, shall i go back from whence i came or am i safe here with you? you seem to know what a 'rick roll' is so i'm impressed...'cause i've never heard the term."
554,sarc,"wow gary, two sentences (sort of) and not a single america bashing comment... i'm impressed."
555,sarc,"did you actually read all of that? wow, i'm impressed. maybe next time you should actually try and refute my argument."
556,sarc,"what? don't they have boyfriends? i'm just amazed that they don't design all women shirts so that they come off easy. hell, they invented the easy access bra ;)"
557,sarc,"call it what you will - cry, whine, pout, 'put on notice', it's all the same to me. i wasn't trying to be profound that's for sure, apparently, you didn't see the humour either. :p i'm just really amused at how you've got your knickers in a bunch over the #%$# !@#$@ atheists that are coming to 'ruin' everything you cherish. :p the funniest thing, well there's two actually, one, you don't really have a leg to stand on legally despite your claims to the contrary, and two, the threat is mostly in your head. boo hoo. emoticonxcry  waxy"
558,sarc,"and bill clinton didn't? obama doesn't? emoticonxdonno let me help you with that. emoticonxangel she's a conservative! i'll bet her upcoming debate with biden will get far more attention than mccain/obama did! i'll sure be watching! word has it that the moderator is an obama lover.  i'm just surprised that so many consider it so important how one performs in these quick witted, personality contests. just because a person is slightly off the mark in wits doesn't mean he/she would not be a good leader - able to make sound political decisions.  looks aside, pelosi's a dingbat compared to palin. she gets a free pass from the news media - ho hum."
559,sarc,"i'm just surprised that 'compliment' is in your vocabulary... for that, i compliment you."
560,sarc,"she? uh, you don't know me like that, miss thing. you're the one with more pudenda than the pointer sisters. and i'm not eating any attention. i'm mildly amused. i haven't seen any evidence of your reputed prowess here. and why don't you ask the real monkey to dance? somebody at home."
561,sarc,"i had expected better, so i'm mildly surprised to see this poster limbo gaily beneath the unspeakable basement standard set by his comrades in arms. emoticonxconfused"
562,sarc,"that site is an embarrassing joke, so i'm not at all surprised by your reference. nor am i surprised that you chose not to answer the question. so far, your contribution to the discussion has been predictably worthless and cowardly. feel free, by the way, to take anything from that silly site and show us how it's probative."
563,sarc,"i'm shocked! how could hunter mislead me so? emoticonxrolleyes given his previous output, i have to confess that i'm not at all surprised that this was a garbage in, garbage out moment. i feel slightly embarrassed at not stopping to consider the preposterous nature of a 14% figure though emoticonxembarrassed"
564,sarc,"what are you talking about  the remnants of their lost civilisation do you want them to still be around with their little bows and arrows hunting buffalo? they have evolved! just as we have evolved. you don't see us driving in a horse and carriage, do you? why aren't you lamenting the 'remnants' of our lost civilization? man! you are so stupid i find it hard to believe you are a scientist... but then again, maybe you are what passes as a scientist in europe. i'm not at all surprised ;)"
565,sarc,"i guess this is another one of your mutual admiration club's charmingly racist moments. 'i bet she's black, and ergo, smokes crack.' gee you're all so mother hubbard rhymie. how do you live with yourself? such ignorance; at this point, i'm not even surprised you don't know which montmartre i'm referencing. i don't think i'll tell you, poot."
566,sarc,i guess i'm not really surprised at some of the reaction here: ignorant blather. i am dissappointed though. it's amazing what people will say about something with no knowledge of it. yes.
567,sarc,and yet you are angry over the ruling so all you can fling out as ammo is the judges orientation. nothing based upon the merits of the case or the details from both sides but only the fact that he is gay. coming from you i'm not surprised in the least. oh and wonderful quotations insisting being out is a detriment and saying someone is jumping out of normallicy simply because they support marriage equality..
568,sarc,"she was never 'pro-gun' to you people. she was an anti. omg they reported on something. not exactly ready to help her reputation out before she was shot, though, were they? you have lots of bros that are lunatics. and one of them just shot and murdered 6 people, including a federal judge who was sitting on an immigration case and a congresswoman who opposed to arizona's immigration law. arizona: your land of cowgirl jan and cowboy sheriff joe.  i never heard of anyone who truly understood what a soul was, who thought they didn't need a mirror. i'm not surprised you think yourself at the level of god himself, able to judge who has a soul and who doesn't. it's the same psychology your bro with a gun just demonstrated."
569,sarc,"you have some good points but a whole lot of gibberish too but you forgot to say why you feel that?????? why did you forget and just go for the insult?? too silly! conservatives have always been very open about their disagreements with rand, but many also welcome her as a very very powerful ally against liberalism. i'm not surprised that you didn't know that what lack???????? what hypocrisy????? of course it does. many countries don't accept immigrants, it is a huge upheaval personally to do so, and most countries will be more liberal than the usa. certainly that is one option most sensible people would utilize when possible. what?????????"
570,sarc,"justincredulous, i'm not surprised that you cut and pasted a comment out of context to make a point. it isn't beneath you to do so. emoticonxrolleyes"
571,sarc,"that doesn't suprise me. again i'm not surprised that your first reaction to the idea that people aren't equal would be to enslave some and that your second idea would be to subjegate women. this reveals way too much about your nature. it ain't pretty. try living homeless for a year then get back to me on whether you saw yourself as equal to someone on '1million a year' emoticonxrolleyes now if the '1million a year' person gave the homeless person 1/2 million a year, then they would be equal, because equality is at the entre of such socialist ideals."
572,sarc,"well, you haven't been right too often on this forum, so i'm not surprised. :)"
573,sarc,"winston's from australia where guns are banned and abuse of women is almost 10x higher than the us. maybe there's a correlation there? emoticonxkill  either way, i'm not surprised that you started yet another male bashing thread. emoticonxrolleyes"
574,sarc,"anyone else see the irony? i don't have time to look up my facts, but i'll just say my opinions are facts!  let's just ignore that overall, republican adminstrations have more officials indicted or convicted of state & federal laws. nixon's adminstration alone accounts for many of the republican number (golwater called nixon the most dishonest person he'd ever met in his life). and do we need to remind jim of the ratio of republicans who have gone to jail or been indicted compared to democrats in the past 6 years?  right. strom thurmand laughs at you from his grave.  with a ideology like that, i'm not surprised."
575,sarc,go back to the part in which we were discussing a specific case and stop trying to encompass the universe in your justification. (you know there are mothers in bokoboko that don't have enough lizard eggs to feed their babies so they eat them)emoticonxbanghead  i'm not surprised that a moral definition of selfish disgusts you. splat! :)
576,sarc,"another attack from one who claims to be a loving christian. oh well, i'm not surprised."
577,sarc,"then explain why the moon isn't burning, after all, it's significently larger then any known comet.  this is beyond ignorant. explain how something far smaller then the moon could sustain nuclear fusion for millions of years yet brown dwarfs which are larger then the moon can't.  coronal mass ejections are not even similar to comets. we have evidence of what comets are. spectrum analysis of light given off by vaporization tells us exactly what they are made of. given your comments, i'm not surprised that the scientific contributions of the islamic world over the past 50 years have essentially been nothing."
578,sarc,"since we're at war with radical islam and they have attacked our homeland once already and have promised a repeat performance. it is ludicrous, irresponsible and suicidal to consider that investigating people of islamic descent before allowing them entry to be a discriminatory policy. especially since terrorists don't fight like men but are committed only to hit and die/run sneak attacks. but i'm not surprised that you're blinded by political correctness when you should be concerned about your families security. emoticonxrolleyes"
579,sarc,"child, your assumption is not only simplistic, childish and patently ridiculous, but it is coming from you so i'm not surprised at all that you're making it. you can deduce and somehow read into my rejection of your statement being evidence of anything is claiming that christianity is the only religion, but i made clear above that my only intent was to show that your claim that your siggy proves anything at all is patently absurd. but make of it what you will. i'll give you the last word to spew your lies and delusions about what you want to say i believe. so have at it little boy, er, i mean, child. emoticonxbye"
580,sarc,"oh, i see now. it's your inability to speak the language that we're dealing with here. bill o'reilly was just quoted in the piece, he didn't write it. and yes, i would believe o'reilly before moyers in a heartbeat. but i'm not surprised you would consider it a deranged hit piece though, since it hits so close to who and what you are."
581,sarc,i'm not surprised anyone would interpret that way. who knew that protecting our daughters actually meant protecting them from harm?
582,sarc,"it's more along the lines of you saying you were going to do something... ... and posting it ... ... then deciding to erase all evidence of what you said you were going to do after you decide you don't want to follow through. care enough to make this post, eh? ironically, it had to do with you not coming back to this thread anymore... but yeah. i'm not surprised you *wouldn't remember* that... emoticonxfrazzled"
583,sarc,"which post do you think most accurately demonstrates archie's ethics? is it the one(s) where he denigrates gays? the one(s) where he accuses those who disagree with him of being filthy, rotten liars, but is incapable of providing an example of their dishonesty? maybe it's the one(s) where he goes off on an insult laden rant that manages to break damn near every point of the tos? since i've just listed pretty much all of his posts, which one demonstrates archie's impeccable ethics the best? seeing as how you just accused a perfect stranger of having no ethics, simply because he disagreed with you, i'm not surprised you feel a kinship with archie."
584,sarc,"i'm not surprised that you didn't get the point that i wasn't really questioning his spelling when i replied to his 'you are heavy on the inane claims... ' with 'you mean accurate claims. your spelling sucks. emoticonxrolleyes ' but rather his statement. but that's ok, we know some people have difficulty with adult concepts such as sarcasm."
585,sarc,"i'm not surprised that you side with them. you're three peas in a pod. my point was that constantly beating dissenter over the head with the bible is counter-productive and the antithesis of jesus' message.  i suggest that if your goal is to fight all religious challengers, you're in the wrong religion. you should be muslims. muslins want to beat non-believers into submission, not christians."
586,sarc,"according to what you mentioned previously, you violated the 'don't ask, don't tell' policy and came out of the closet, disrupting your unit. real classy, jazy. your gay sex sin took preference over honorable service. but then that's your idol, so i'm not surprised."
587,sarc,"really? lol i'm honored that my attention whoring has inspired you x) and don't even thinking about surpassing the master! it will ensue a civil war.  i'm not surprised. he plays a little rough with the rest of my pets. though jum, the elephant, doesn't look the same without her tusk..."
588,sarc,"look. it responded again. i swear, it just gets funnier. look at how far he's managed to fool himself: ' you are pissed at me for simply speaking the undeniable truth. does the truth normally piss you off?' lol. i'm not surprised that a skinhead and potential kkk member thinks that his perspective is absolute while everyone else's is inferior."
589,sarc,"wow, in your very warped world view, people with moral values that defend the most defenseless among us and speak for those who can't speak for themselves are seen as morally perverted by you? how terribly pathetic of you capo. but sadly, i'm not the least bit surprised at how incredibly shallow your perspective is. what boggles the mind though is that you're unable to empathize with a whole class of human beings whom you once were yourself. just think about it capo, can you see what that say's about you?"
590,sarc,"i'm quite surprised this hasn't got more attention. usually all you have to do is whisper the word abortion around here and there's a firestorm. not that that was what i was going for, i'm just surprised. maybe this article is just too straightforward for people emoticonxangel"
591,sarc,"it's the first time i've seen you in that light, and i don't like it either, i'm really surprised at your stance on this one. don't let all those televangelists out there in on your secret passage. :p  for anyone who uses the bible, or interprets it in such a way, as to justify something that would seem contrary to reason or the 'core meaning' of the bible. imho, that's where the trouble starts. waxy"
592,sarc,"i'm shocked. have you been crossdressing? you can have mine when i get breast cancer and die because you didn't use the cool new pink google :/ they're fake, but you don't have to tell anyone"
593,sarc,i'm shocked that people side with illogical arguments rather than logic.
594,sarc,"i'm shocked! people are downvoting your obama has almost the same number of letters as hitler argument... they must be nazis. uh-oh, george has exactly the same number of letters at hitler - does that make him more like hitler than obama??"
595,sarc,"i'm shocked! shocked, i say!!! you seem so pure! roflmao....sorry!"
596,sarc,"dude, check my results. i'm shocked. i answered honestly. wow. you were def right, i aint no liberal. o.o"
597,sarc,once again i'm shocked to find myself agreeing with randomdude. then again his arguments seem well constructed and logical next to debates (and the consequent points you make on them) like 'is my country the best country' or whatever it was called.
598,sarc,"so.... whats he been doing for the past two thousand years? i'm sure this rapture probably requires a lot of paperwork.... i mean, if you're going to torture and murder millions of people i guess you better have all your t's crossed and i's dotted huh?"
599,sarc,"to be honest, i'm surprised it was that hard to give a corporate handout. any big insurance company and big drug company is delighted since their competition will now be squashed and the average joe will delight in their weaker care at a higher price. but hey, a for effort, right? emoticonxrolleyes you don't get points for failing to deliver or delivering a failure in my opinion."
600,sarc,i'm surprised that some of the more frothing liberals here have not yet suggested that we now have a way of tracking and potentially treating the 'abnormal' brains of conservatives.
601,sarc,"i'm surprised that some people still don't realize that not everyone thinks the same way they do emoticonxrolleyes  i, for example, detest children, have no desire to have any of my own and in fact would genuinely fear for any children i might have or are under my direct care. my family is generally bad tempered and 1 in particular has children that pretty much everyone feels sorry for because of how strict this relative is. but hey, as long as you can sleep better knowing you restricted her 'freedom' it's ok, right? you're right :) abortion is one of her options."
602,sarc,"i'm surprised no one has unearthed some stickman figures and announced that the drawings of jesus have been discovered, as recorded in john 8:7, where he's doodling on the ground while some poor young woman is about to get pelted with rocks. what a pilgrimage that would make..."
603,sarc,"the nice part. i'm surprised that you've even read the bible. presumably you're commenting on 1 thessalonians 5:2, wherein paul admonishes the greeks to be watchful for the coming of god? the funny thing is that all of my bibles say that."
604,sarc,i'm surprised he hasn't made a shameless plug for his bible: mein kampf. :p
605,sarc,"thanks for clarifying the point i was making to simone. with all of your difficulties with comprehension, i'm surprised you got it. emoticonxsmilie"
606,sarc,i just like the author...i'm surprised a single person even knows who he is with the level of society's litterary intelligence. emoticonxsmilie
607,sarc,"i'm surprised cindy sheehan and the radical left aren't wearing turbans and funding al queda already, as much as they despise america's war on terrorism. but maybe some of them are."
608,sarc,"neither; he was a deist who felt that the bulk of christianity was ridiculous. [source] clearly, jefferson's 'real christian' is hardly at all a true christian. in fact, jefferson felt that the beliefs that evangelicals hold today were absurd and irrational. rather than address my points in the slightest manner, your response consists entirely of this. (think i'm surprised?) and you somehow think that i'm the one being defeated? but then, with your 'understanding' of logic, nobody's surprised."
609,sarc,"i'm surprised to learn that you have the slightest idea about biology. also, your spelling and grammar is ever so much better in this post than your posts in another thread. how many of you are pretending to be a poster named vt?"
610,sarc,"much more is happening in the world today than your little gay crusade matthew. but keep your single issue, and totally limited perspective in life, that's what you're good at. could you post where i said that revelation speaks to the rcc vs the protestant reformation ms ? as christ was a jew trebor, his followers wont ever cease to exist, just as god has preserved the jew according to his promises. i'm surprised you can't appreciate that my friend."
611,sarc,"well, it's nice to know my assumption there was a dishonest ulterior motive (rather than actually wanting to discuss it) to the request was indeed correct. can't say i'm surprised though. this poster has consistently avoided actual discourse with most anyone with whom he'd find real disagreement (gasp!) for as long as i've known of him, usually choosing instead to throw his easy 'drive-by' insults from the peanut gallery. basically, he's a coward, and most anywhere else would probably be considered a troll."
612,sarc,i'm surprised he didn't google it. maybe that's too logical?
613,sarc,"true, though they can't have been going against the bible as it didn't exist then. how did people decide what was right or wrong before the bible came along? all those millennia without a moral guideline, i'm surprised the human race ever made it (or any other race for that matter). emoticonxangel smiley emoticonxangel"
614,sarc,"as i said, for clarification, and no other reason. it's all drivel to me anyway, so i didn't see the problem in adding evolution onto theory. show where it said that if you would, and clarify your question. if you'll notice, it said approximately, not exactly half its life. i'm surprised you couldn't deduce that by just reading what it said. why are you asking me this question smiley as if i wrote the article? can't you tell the difference between quoting a piece and writing it?"
615,sarc,"given your proclivities, i'm surprised that you are not praising president clinton to the skies for supporting your supposedly moral pov. now, shall we examine mccain & governor gidget's views on the topic?"
616,sarc,"oh gee, they wrote letters threatening to publish names of companies that supported the activists. how horrendous as your side justifies its activities. how terrible is that? did they converge on those companies enmasse with placards and prevent people from gaining entrance, or not wanting to go through the crowd for fear of being attacked? no! but in your mind, writing letters is evil yet you're blind to what your side is doing. i wish i could say i'm surprised at your hypocritical position, but i'm not.  did blacks protest white churches after the people voted against civil rights or prevented blacks from registering to vote? prove they did that foundit. they had marches down main streets and picketed city hall's. not private citizens in their places of worship, and you know it."
617,sarc,telling of what?....that some imaginative authors created fantasy stories wherein guns were unnecessary for the champions to win? that has no bearing on reality. i'm surprised that you tried to extend that into real life.
618,sarc,"in that case its a single act of terroism so if you know all of this what's the name of his group? i wasn't on a high horse. also could you post the source saying he was part of some group and not just a loon.  jeez that sucks. *shrugs* well no different from black leaders who were targeted, slave owners/abolitionists who were targeted. this happens all the time. i'm surprised it hasn't happened earlier. i love how its a conspiracy! *roll eyes* its terrorism not a conspiracy. unless you gonna tell me the governments in on it. xd"
619,sarc,"i'm surprised archangel hasn't jumped on this.  he's gullible enough to fall for tv props, why not this?"
620,sarc,"geeze, oldsarge, i'm sorry you missed the rabies shots when they were passing them out. i'm surprised to see you still around frothing at the mouth."
621,sarc,"you really need to stop reading such biased, uninformed digital-age fishwrapper. i can think of at least one instance off the top of my head, justice alito's confirmation. the democrats threatened to filibuster bush's scotus choice. the gang of seven democrats agreed not to filibuster in return for the republicans not to use the 'nuclear option'. it was in all of the papers. i'm surprised that the leftwing rag missed it. emoticonxrolleyes"
622,sarc,"btw, jazyjason, before you edited out your complimentary comment about howard dean. just wanted to say i'm surprised you said anything to associate yourself thus with a such an irrational far left commie. must stay with the mudflingers and lynch mobs and, especially if they're jesus lovers, ya know. so ... i understand why you took it down. merry christmas."
623,sarc,"you don't see him leading the pack, do you? no family jewels. i'm surprised he doesn't run to canada. emoticonxchickenemoticonxchicken"
624,sarc,"i'm surprised that your picture doesn't precede the phrase 'ignorance of actual american history' in every encyclopedia on earth, simone. emoticonxdonno emoticonxfrazzled emoticonxic emoticonxwow"
625,sarc,i'm surprised that so many people got their knickers in a knot over the ramblings of pat robinson. emoticonxwow
626,sarc,"running away again? typical. you come in and derail the thread from its original discussion, offer up your p***y pacifist propaganda, quote selected verses in the bible to make it look like you've got support from god, and then you turn tail and run when confronted with the facts that prove your position wrong. not that i'm surprised. what else can you expect from a man who wouldn't even defend his own family against danger?"
627,sarc,"perhaps you should smoke a lot less crack? funny isn't it how the people who say that invariably want a larger government? btw adam smith, aka 'miguel sanchez', is a prominent mexican free market economist and spiritual leader of the latino pride movement, with suspected ties to people smuggling and drug trafficking operations along the californian border. his magnum opus the wealth of mexicans details an insidious plot to bring down racial equality through free market principles, estabilishing a millenium of full spectrum mexican dominance of the american financial, legal and industrial systems. the only barrier to his evil plot? patriotic americans who understand the benefits of government control in all aspects of their lives. i'm surprised someone as educated on such a diverse array of issues as yourself hasn't come across him."
628,sarc,"i'm surprised. i was sure you'd have read her essays on capitalism, but i guess only so many books are required before you can defend proper economics."
629,sarc,it is logically impossible to have no beliefs. i'm surprised you even know what 'logic' means or what being 'logical' entails given the poor quality of your arguments.
630,sarc,lol bias dysfunctions. i'm surprised you know such a long word. pity you don't know what it means. i can't blame you... being a retarded ignorant white woman. you don't even understand the absurdity of your own beliefs. go back to cleaning the house. worse is that you don't work yet you take the piss out of immigrants who work but don't pay taxes. you're better how?
631,sarc,jesus christ srom!!! you live in the stone age... i'm surprised you have internet access.
632,sarc,and nobody knows google better then the man that googles everything.  still hunting for excuses bohemian? i'm surprised you didn't yell fallacy. invalid and uncogent must be today's words for the day. i'm sure we will all see them used in other debates throughout the remainder of the day. can't wait and see what is tomorrows word.
633,sarc,with such eloquent and compelling arguments as this i'm surprised it hasn't happened already.
634,sarc,"... are you asking me for evidence that this debate doesn't name specifics? er, then as evidence i submit this debate. you mean your grandkids. and again, hair is apparently more important than policies to the right wing. i'm surprised you didn't just make an acronym of my name, that woulda shown me what's what. no, republicans don't have the majority and they likely never will again until they change their backwards ways. what the republicans have is a bought and paid for propaganda machine called fox, and a band of old fat people scared of their own shadow (not to mention afraide of the scary black guy in office) who will believe any psychotic conspiracy fox throws their way. republicans won't have the majority after this midterm, and the republicans are going to lose more seats when obama is re-elected in 2012."
635,sarc,yep. you got it.  i'm so busted.  seriously. you were a lot closer with the 'abusive participant' thing and i'm surprised that you (of all people) took the line that you did. cheap shots like that are not something that you are known for.
636,sarc,you are an idiot and i'm surprised you are able to navigate the internet with a computer. anyone who actually knows how to use a thesaurus can see your incompetence and dishonesty for what it is.
637,sarc,"no i'm not. well you certainly should be. to me it doesn't matter how the fetus got there, and seriously, why is it relevant for you to know that? wow...i'd say i'm surprised but i'm really not. so you're saying that people who don't want a baby stupid enough to have unprotected sex are on an equal playing field with those who properly applied protection which failed? that's ludicrous and you really should know better.  well. with condoms.. you have no baby. and with abortion, you don't have any baby either.. you left out a few important details there buddy. with the killing of a 3-month old with an axe you have no baby. but its the same result! yippee!"
638,sarc,"Plain with the benefit of hindsight. I love how you're able to determine, not having been there, precisely what was said and precisely where it fell in relation to the law. If it was so clear, we'll see the prosecution for wrongful arrest in due course, I'm sure. "
639,sarc,"i have several that i want everyone who engages in the 'man caused global warming' debate to consider.... and i thank you for helping to illustrate some of those points for me (bold text above). asside from the points we've already discussed,... i am a bit intrigued by the fact that many of your ilk (concerned about saving the lives of millions by reversing or slowing the warming trends of the planet) are seemingly oblivious and uncaring about the millions who are deliberately killed in the name of 'choice.' isn't the decision to drive an suv a choice as well? emoticonxrolleyes"
640,sarc,"it was germany's drive for nationalism that led to britian's defeat, wwll. want to rethink your position? news flash, britain won ww2, germany lost. i am actually astounded that you didn't know that."
641,sarc,"i have read some of what you write about god. i have been amazed! thank you! i am amazed your parents/caregivers/orderlies/guards let you have access to a computer yah my parents allow me to have internet access and so does my school.  i am amazed you harbor the impression anyone, much less everyone, thinks you are so great thank you. i am amazed you survived being dropped on your head as an infant i was never dropped on my head as an infant."
642,sarc,"i am amused by how some people can look at an article of an anti-gay marriage advocate attacking a gay marriage advocate, and the person reading the article wants to focus on what qualifies as 'oppression' and how gays could have it worse... emoticonxdonno  just out of curiousity, do you have any comment as to whether or not the attack was wrong?"
643,sarc,"emoticonxrolleyes  like i mentioned, i stopped using the 'l-word' because steeeeve and another kept shifting the focus of the conversation to demand that i prove that they knew they were telling a falsehood. boringly enough, their antics completely neutered threads into meaningless squabbling. the discussion about the topic of the thread stopped completely. they often did not even tried to debate that their statement was not false. steeeeve has a lovely habit of ignoring what he can't cope with. i am amused at how my name doesn't seem to be the focus of any of these 'liar!' threads, but that doesn't stop me from bringing me up here. obsess much steeeeve?"
644,sarc,"the same could be said of you... little jimmy is torturing small animals, but don't worry. he isn't killing anybody... < end sarcasm > the quote in question. 'i want to see them as radically laying down their lives for the gospel. as they are over in pakistan, in israel, in palistan, in all those different places...' it references some pretty serious hotbeds of violence. not just *figuratively* committing your life to god, but people killing in god's name. people dying in god's name. plus, she explicitly states 'radically laying down their lives'. not *figuratively* laying down their lives. she chose a word that indicates elevation of action. quite frankly, i am astonished that you don't seem to have any concern over her statement. you write it off without even bothering to look at what she actually said."
645,sarc,well i always assumed i was the biggest harry potter fan. i am astounded to learn that historical facts support it. i thought it was the creation of someone's imagination as opposed to jesus who historically existed whether or not he was the son of god. emotions run way too high on both side in these kinds of arguments so you end up with one party belittling in not so subtle ways another and vice versa as though it's clever and wins them points. :(
646,sarc,"there is no problem in what you 'believe' in. science is irrelevant in many beliefs. just sole belief in a deity and his disciples, is what many religions revolve around. but, i am astounded by your god's name, no harsh feelings. a dragon lord king is quite a mouth full don't you say? can we just call em, greeble. :)"
647,sarc,"oh my gosh i am bloody stunned! speachless(almost) even.you are an absolute genious! oh if i knew how to type bowing to your feet, i would.thankyou.sincerely dacey."
648,sarc,"so your saying dr. tiggerroo, that my parents decided i would be gay for me. fascinating. do you have any other amazing rubbish to spit out of your mouth. i am captivated by your amazing intelligence on this subject. it sound like you have been studying this all through kindergarden. grow up, get a clue."
649,sarc,i am equally astonished you two road apples don't recognize satire when you see it emoticonxgood
650,sarc,"it's my first day and i'm already wishing forums had an ignore button. this really is my first day, and i am frankly flabbergasted. is this (archie-types) an ongoing problem here, or an isolated individual? i feel like i'm arguing with my 6 year old niece. i'm asking everyone out there who has been there for a while. seriously. as a former christian, i have numerous christian friends whose conversation and opinions i respect and think i could learn something from - but, well...jesus, is this the norm around here? this is not a rhetorical question."
651,sarc,"i am impressed you are impressed by that backward-minded bigot who's main insight was a mere claim without justification on any form of harm to the institution of marriage and said, 'fuck the fags'? come on dude."
652,sarc,"archie, it's already 'cleared up' that you're a liar. you claimed to know what he was about. you claimed it was a 'secular site that's dedicated to exposing the homosexual, extreme left, communist and anarchist agenda'. but he's not really interested in 'homosexuality' at all. and i find you're 'couldn't find it' to be incredibly absurd. it's on the web-page where he talks about the event in the first place. if you actually start clicking to see the pics and his comments, it's right there! i'm not linking to pornographic material on this web-site. the header of that web-page reads:  'up your alley fair san francisco, july 27, 2008 part 1' i am incredibly amused that you repeatedly lie all over the place on this web-site, but then you press others for proof."
653,sarc,"woohoohoo, diogenes, talk about twisting my statements, wow! wow! i am just plain flabbergasted!"
654,sarc,"leroyjames, i am just shocked at your blatantly sarcastic response to kelly ;)"
655,sarc,"i am mildly surprised steve hasn't argued that if we recognise gay marriage, we will have to accommodate the hoards of americans eager to marry their buicks, dogs and dead relatives. after all, if we lift one of the unreasonable restrictions on marriage we are compelled to lift every single last reasonable one. makes sense, right? emoticonxrolleyes"
656,sarc,"i am more amused than anything else. i don't have to 'attack your character', you do a much better job at showing exactly what you are made of than anybody else can."
657,sarc,i am none too surprised to see that the point was totally and utterly lost on you.
658,sarc,what is the point of arguing that life arose via evolution? at the rate you generate it i am not surprised.
659,sarc,i think you underestimate the intelligence of a 6 year old and what they can comprehend............... and that 6 year old is not only the people but the future which makes it even more imperative that he or she know the sacrafices others have made to make this country the great country it is........ i am not surprised you call it brainwashing though....... emoticonxrolleyes
660,sarc,"well, i am not surprised you think science is a cult. i guess you think everything you don't understand is a cult. emoticonxrolleyes"
661,sarc,"my point is entirely relevant to exposing those who make false claims about the interests of 'sanctity' of marriage, or 'traditional' marriage. yet i am not surprised you refuse to address it. emoticonxrolleyes listen jyoshu... did i say it was? i pointed out that it would be obvious that love should be more of a qualifier than 'man/woman'. yet again, no surprise from me that you refused to address that. are you serious? courts look at emotions all the time. particularly in family court. regardless, you're avoiding the point i am really making. the point is about the 'pro-family' side who are 'protecting' an institution which doesn't even care about love. and logically, the 'pro-family' side should be able to recognize that, and their indifference to it demonstrates how much they don't care about such concerns either..."
662,sarc,"you can't 'drop' what you never had in the first place. he was never a 'gay pride' person. he's a gossip columnist who happens to be gay. he uses his 'gay' thing like a prop, the way some politicians use 'christianity' as a tool for votes and attention. i am not surprised you can't tell the difference... emoticonxrolleyes"
663,sarc,"emoticonxwow archie, i realize the following will be wasted on you, but i'll say it anyways.... there is a huge difference inbetween a 'spiritual' issue... and a demonic one... the fact that christians look at 'homosexuality' as a spiritual issue is one thing. blaming it on demons and invoking an exorcism is quite another. and thus, archie places himself firmly in the 'exorcism' camp... i am not surprised... archie, there are a lot of christian reparative therapy groups out there. by and large, they don't work with 'exorcisms'. do you think they should be working with 'exorcisms' to rid people of homosexuality???"
664,sarc,i am not his buddy. my objection was that you thought he was english( please tell me he's not) and that your perception of english people was wrong and insulting i do not care whether american ( or should i be a prat like you and call you a yank?)people carry guns or not and have never supported his argument. looking at some of your stupid smug posts i am not surprised that you need a gun for protection. look in the mirror fella and you will see penfold mk ii.
665,sarc,"and it is the nature of conspiracy theorists to stumble upon some small fact and let their very large imaginations run away with it to the land of make believe bullshit. so i am not surprised that your conspiracy theory has some element of truth to it; i would be surprised if it didn't. this doesn't make it all true, unfortunately for you.  fortunately for you, you're a religious nutjob in addition to being a conspiracy theorist, so you don't actually need to worry about the truth; you have faith! damn the evidence, this is all about adapting the truth to suit your own narrow preconceived ideas. sorry, not your ideas, per se, rather the ideas foisted upon you that you preach to others."
666,sarc,"what i do recognize is a tendency by some people to obfuscate the point of a thread, and totally ignore its validity / invalidity... 'tongue in cheek' is irrelevant to my point. typo... should have read 'climb on board', but i guess the more pointless and menial complaints to side-track from the original comment, the better, eh? emoticonxrolleyes i am perpetually amused at how the republican party has gone from a) insisting that we cannot judge bush now, because history will be his judge as to the adequacy of his presidency, to b) insisting that after only a few months, we know for absolute certainty that obama is a failure. my how the worm turns..."
667,sarc,"this seems like a begging the question fallacy. lets just assume that they 'do not' have control over it...it would be the same thing for an alcoholic (which people are also born with). are you saying alcoholics should be allowed to live in this lifestyle? i guess it is societies fault emoticonxrolleyes looks like jyoshu's reactions were correct for you i am pretty surprised no one is like 'yeah, this is still a problem'..instead they are going '25%...that aint too bad'. even worse, they blame other people. in fact, robbie says gay men are acting 'recklessly' because they aren't treated as 'normal', yet he believes that gay men are ready to have families. how can you be reckless yet be ready for a family?..or rather, a good family?"
668,sarc,"i am really surprised you think that there are less than 500 incidents of people dying of second hand smoking. if you know that less about smoke, then i think we should stop right here. yet, you want to remove that right from all people, which i think is unreasonable and despotic. i want to remove the right from parents to destroy their children's lungs. thats what i'm trying to do. when do you think we have freedom? is it when alcohol, marijuana and whatever you can come up with is legalized without age limit? how is that freedom. how is it freedom to be forced to live in a smoke that kills you. i don't understand you people.. to become a free country, legalize everything. legalize murder, legalize robbery.. as long as you feel free, who cares about others?"
669,sarc,"i am well aware (and sympathetic) to your hatred of jews, negros, gays, gypsies, etc.; but i am shocked and dismayed at your ignorance (and/or) intolerance of hermaphrodites.  hitler; you sir, have lost my respect."
670,sarc,oh do go on. i am so impressed by your 'intellectuall' argument. pfft.
671,sarc,"of course it crossed my mind, but logic isn't allowed; this is religion. jesus isn't showing up or walking away from their bread munching wine drinking rituals. i am supposed to be surprised that jesus supposedly said just one more thing which makes no sense what so ever? the early church wasn't called catholic because there were no other protestants running around to differentiate between. if imagination alone could generate heaven, you would be right. i have no reason to believe heaven exists. which are based on the beliefs of the early church, which you have already admitted existed during jesus's life time."
672,sarc,"yes secular governments work. nor does it take much to see the philosophical similarities, as pointed out by trebor, between a religion, such as christianity or islam and communism, socialism, capitalism, totalitarism or a monarchy, but it does require an additional step, hence my comment of 2+2+2.  but just for kicks, let's say i am fully on board with communism as a religion and am now jumping ship on the idea. this would be the only reason you can give, other than what you have misunderstood which is explained abvove, that makes the study flawed. which doesn't take a genius to grasp makes no sense whatsover. so take your time, think about it, because there is an argument to made for your view and i am surprised nobody picked up on it, but let's see if you can figure it out on your own."
673,sarc,i guess you failed that class. i am surprised that you passed any of your classes.. but i guess paper mills are paper mills.
674,sarc,"wrong again daewoo; but at least you are painfully consistent. i am merely pointing out the hypocrisy and level of ignorance obama displays every time he opens his economically clueless and divisive mouth. but then, who would ever accuse you of getting anything right? once again, the buffet rule is for the gullible and clueless to glom onto in a vacuum of reality and the fact that it would do nothing to solve this nations problems and is merely a diversion from the massive failure this president has been, more so than even carter.  i cant say i am surprised you would glom onto such an idiot talking point.  it is only strange for someone who is so completely clueless that they cannot even comprehend a simple thread premise.  so were you born this clueless, or deliberately play the role of someone who is patently clueless?"
675,sarc,"i support lower taxes fro the rich, the poor, and the middle class as well. in order to pull this off, you have to lower spending. this just isn;t going to happen with any of the current folks in power, nor will we likely be seeing any fresh faces that manage to pull off such a plan inthe future. that is a pretty impresive education you are working on (though it in no way makes you a shoe in for any political position). i am surprised you have come this far without somebody explaining to you that benifits of our current taxation system go far beyond having a police station or a highway on ramp next to your house. i guess maybe now that is a lesson they save for graduate school. they used to teach it in the 6th grade. sad."
676,sarc,"let us not forget that his 99% figure is most likely a load of horse dung in the first place. in fact, he's so full of **** that i am surprised the pressure build-up hasnt blown the top of his bloody head off."
677,sarc,"more from unkerpaulie's list: 'world net daily' is a 'medical/scientific institution'????????????????????? from the website: unbiased??????????????????? really, unkerpaulie, i am surprised you didn't list fred phelps website in your 'medical/scientific institutions' list."
678,sarc,"michele i am surprised you believe a politician, you must be mellowing in your old age........... eventually the 9th circuit will here the california issue.....oh and i know where the 9th circuit court is........."
679,sarc,"jyoshu, for someone who is so sure of his opinions, i am surprised that you have chosen to ignore my challenge to you statement - (btw, inseparable is spelt with an 'a'. :) ) leo"
680,sarc,"wow, i am surprised. no one told me vor had an illegitimate son. a real chip off the ol' block, same semi- coherent responses, same composition skills, same flag waving propensity, same absence of logical argument. i note that the double exclamation marks have replaced the period bursts but that may change following puberty. dono"
681,sarc,"why should anyone be swayed by facts, logic or reason? i am surprised to find out that it george w. bush was not responsible for these 'acts of terrorism' of the founding fathers. josef said http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism"
682,sarc,"i am really sorry and i have a confession. i dont read any of your stuff. i am surprised you dont know that by now! once again, my deepest apologies."
683,sarc,"i am surprised you dont use the phrase religious persecution because that is exactly what i am doing to do to you, right?"
684,sarc,what can you expect from someone that believes everything they have comes not from themselves but from some invisible being that actually does all the work. i am surprised that the creationist aren't saying everything that is is because their god created it though the people who have invented the products.
685,sarc,"although it later turned out that the use of the word 'their' may have been used in the plural, the use of the word in this post could well have been the singular. note i also high-lighted 'a person' (to which 'their' applied). so, i have nothing to be embarrassed about. i am surprised that you had never come across the use of the singular 'they/their/them'. it goes all the way back to chaucer's canterbury tales and whoso fyndeth hym out of swich blame, they wol come up [...] lewis and jane austin also used it. so, at least you managed to learn something today."
686,sarc,"iow, you don't have a clue. the usual nothing just a wag. i am surprised nato bit on a line like that? perhaps he thought you actually knew something emoticonxgood"
687,sarc,i am surprised scientists havn't made so much of a fuss about you. wow......
688,sarc,i am surprised that you were able to give a non troll answer.
689,sarc,"'wow my life my life is already turning out better then yours' what do you mean your life is turning out well? you live with your parents. you have no responsibilities, accomplishments, or qualifications for anything as you are 15. you are not even old enough to get a job, what are you talking about? ah i see you are related to jakej. i can't say i am surprised."
690,sarc,"wow, i am surprised you didn't say 'kill the retards.'"
691,sarc,"a: when it comes to civil rights, the'majority' does not rule!!!!!!!!!!! i suggest you 'float your boat' in the direction of the vatican city, as you have already proven that your first allegiance is to there, not to the usa of which you presume to be a citizen. emoticonxrolleyes  so what would you have us do? stand by silently while you promote the dogma of a sovereign foreign power (vatican city) to control the rights of us citizens? with your bigoted attitude, i am totally surprised yu are not advocating a constitutional ammendment to make the rcc the one, only, and required legal religion in the usa with the pope as chief executive. emoticonxrolleyes emoticonxrolleyes"
692,sarc,you sound like such a great guy deliberately pissing off a person you call your friend. if that is what you call good works then i am truly impressed.
693,sarc,"so basically, what you are advocating here is that public schools should teach no moral values whatever. they shouldn't teach tolerance, because that offends the intolerant; they shouldn't teach racial equality, because that offends racists; they shouldn't teach religious freedom, because that offends religious bigots. maybe they shouldn't teach the immorality of theft and murder because that offends thieves and murderers.  i am truly surprised to hear a right-winger such as your good self advocating that public schools should promote a moral vacuum. but then, i suppose anything is better than teaching acceptance of gay families as just another sort of family among the many that exist today."
694,sarc,i am very impressed with your ability to copy and paste links. now what this proves about what you know about it is still unproven. unless you are the one in the videos giving the lectures...and he looks like he has been studying this longer then 'almost a decade'. nice try though. what proof can you give that is pertinent to the debate about how that disproves an eternal being? also you may want to get with some of the other atheists on the site because they were pushing the eternal universe and big bounce theories as explanations in other debates. you all should get your scientific consensus on the same page.
695,sarc,"which leaves us with? if you said 'an appeal to majority' you win teh prize! you're not really leaving it to them when you're talking about enacting legislation based on a theory which is still under debate. most doctors won't prescribe marijuana in this country either. i guess we should just leave that to them though, since they're more qualified."
696,sarc,i guess since your know how to post without the 50 characters you are a half veteran but once you figure out behind what's behind the humor of joe's post you will be a full veteran. pay attention.
697,sarc,"hey jesus, you were gone so long i was starting to wonder what happened to you. and now..., here you are, buried (-3 points as of now). i guess they're trying to crucify you again for your position. but i have faith in you. now go out there and show them that they can't keep a good man down!"
698,sarc,"i tried not to look like a tourist when i went to nyc last may, but i guess i gave it away with all of the pictures i was taking."
699,sarc,"oh..., well..., i guess that makes it ok then ;)"
700,sarc,"i guess, then, that you don't have a life? am i mistaken?"
701,sarc,"why thank you , and yes i guessed that as you are pretty busy grovelling to the hide and seek champ , so full credit to you and of course the invisible dictator ..., don be shy take a bow ....."
702,sarc,honestly did not know that acorn was such an evil organization that was based on evil-ness.  but really acorn seems like a very good organization based on helping those in need of help. i was under the impression of something totally different. i guess don't believe what you hear on fox news =]
703,sarc,"great depression? wow, you are drinking obama's kool aid. not really, it's an obvious fact to anyone not invested in corporate freedom. since our economic system is based on a profit loss system, profits are private and losses are not social. so if companies fail as did gm, they fail and not bail them out. i agree, let bad companies fail. oh wait, we can't, because the companies became so big that if they fail, our country will have massive unemployment and an industry vacuum. i guess letting companies grow so big wasn't a good idea? federal government has been bailing out companies and government since the 70's. one more sign that capitalism and the market aren't the magical cureall that you think."
704,sarc,i guess you missed the smiley. here it is again ;)
705,sarc,"as a side-note, i find it curious that the author of this debate proposes to test only on death row inmates and not the prison population generally. i guess she is only half crazy then. :)"
706,sarc,i just love how you attempt to be mr. forum police here steve. if you want to be a moderator so bad why not apply? i'm certain this board could use the help. as far as your scenario it's rather laughable but whatever. point being is if people demand evidence why not give them that? i'd rather be an open honest man than hide behind a handle any day.
707,sarc,"ah yes, i just love it when evangalists show just how christian they are. emoticonxrolleyes"
708,sarc,"i love how you claim that the teabag party is not affiliated with the republicans, who are they going to vote with ?.. the democrats?.. they may not claim to be republicans but last i checked we only have two major parties representing us in the house and senate, with maybe one or two independents.the tea bag party isn't big enough to control anything without republicans so enlighten me, who are they going to vote with to destroy what obama has accomplished so far?..."
709,sarc,"i love how bitm can start all these new threads that ironically, say the same thing over and over, yet somehow when pressed to backup his own policy positions he continually flees the threads. we're still waiting on you bitm..."
710,sarc,"i love how the government has become the scapegoat for the failure of parents to control their kids, and in turn we are losing more and more civil liberties..."
711,sarc,"i love how you speak for all christians when you say that. 'as a racist, i believe that black people...' society has a compelling interest in, if not exposing people to differing cultures, lifestyles etc., then at least in not going out of its way to hide them. if homosexuals are so wrong, then the children will figure that out on their own without government prodding."
712,sarc,i love how marc is just detached from reality. i doubt he'll reply to how he's so wrong about the cases he listed. two can't even be found on findlaw.
713,sarc,"i love how iranian president alphabets kidnaps 15 sailors and marines, holds them captive on bs evidence, and then trys to act like the biggest humanitarian on earth by 'pardoning' them out of the kindness of his heart. personally, i think it would be nice for these 15 british troops to see the bombers going the opposite direction as they leave iranian airspace."
714,sarc,"i love how gun prohibitionists say they want to stop guns getting into the hands of criminals, but they are quite happy for guns to be in the hands of the biggest criminal of all, the government - warmongerer, mass murderer, tyrant and violent thief."
715,sarc,"i love how the rightie wingnuts think that obama is a socialist muslim when their own mentally defective vp nominee is a practicing member of the pentacostal church, and a creationist. at least obama's head is screwed on properly."
716,sarc,"i love how you are pro-choice until its a choice you don't like. let people carry guns in their own home. let them carry it on their person. it has nothing to do with you does it not? unless you deal with people threatening you with guns on a daily basis it doesn't. their house =/= their choice, her body = her choice?  i love hypocrisy."
717,sarc,"i love how you voted true and then tried to challenge the idea. priceless! this is not exactly the same as any of my other debates at all - and this is not about assigning labels. but since you raise the issue, as labels go, the word 'fetus' is the label and 'child' is what the child actually is.  the word fetus is just a label used to mark the stage of life and development that the animal (in this case a human being) is in.  you can see by the comments so far.... it's still a very difficult thing to get pro-aborts to accept."
718,sarc,"i love how many of the far rights love to say they're independant because they disagree with like maybe one republican issue, or because they have a general mistrust of government... yet on every issue (besides maybe the one) and every vote they are lock and step with the conservatives. michael savage is a far right conservative commentator. that's what he is. you can tell because all of his listeners are far right conservatives, or independants who fit into the category i described above. and you can also tell because he falls on either the conservative side of every single issue, or even further right of the conservative side of every issue. while i'm sure it helps sane conservatives sleep at night to think that hate-mongering lunatic isn't of their ilk, i'm afraid it just isn't true."
719,sarc,"i love how you christian apologists repel in horror when you hear about muslim or jewish atrocities, and yet you don't even flinch when someone talks about the rape, murder, genocide, lying, deceit and homophobia committed by your god.  the spanish inquisition was an attempt to maintain catholic indoctrination through violence. you clearly feel asleep in history class. didn't do your homework, did you? i'm not going to deny that people have been influenced positively by christianity, but it's ludicrous to suggest that no bad things have come out of it. ever heard of a little something called to holocaust?"
720,sarc,"lol, i love how everyone seems to feel the need to out-wit rk even after over 50 days xd"
721,sarc,"i love how you ignore all logic, reason, morality, and all rationality. how can you say my arguments are wrong if you will not go through piece by piece and dispute me? if im so wrong, why do you just say that and not actually show that i am wrong.  you hope that one day ill be capable of rational thought? coming from the guy who believes in a magic sky daddy from a fairytale book. oh how silly of me to reject something that i have yet to find any shred of significant evidence for. oh what a fool ive been"
722,sarc,"loll i love how you completely ignore the link i posted ehh?? and then you downvoted me and tried to sound smart afterwards, but actually made yourself look like twice a fool. :d. you better upvote me again. smh. hah."
723,sarc,"also i love how you presume to know how i spend my time. you know i should use my skills as an rn to volunteer at clinics, or help out at places such as the red cross, my local domestic violence shelter, food pantry, fire department, or mission. oh wait i already do those things...with my friends. but i'm sure you already knew that."
724,sarc,"i love how you are using violence to threaten people. when, your argument is disputing violence."
725,sarc,i love how you point out the obvious . like what's already been implied in the statement. lol.
726,sarc,i love how you cons cry race card when someone points out obvious racism.
727,sarc,i love how you're pretending to not know your way around the 50 character minimum... that's cute.
728,sarc,"i love how what you 'personally' feel is in direct conflict with acedemic studies. science says force = mass times acceleration, but i personally feel that force = velocity times volume, so that must be the right answer."
729,sarc,"i love how you came right in talking about gods, but i feel content in dc's god power over marvel's."
730,sarc,i love how you completely ignored the part about your fake account. lol! you so crazy ra!
731,sarc,"i love how your sources never support your point. well, i wasn't able to find out about the rebellions of christianity from your source, but it did show some positive points, so i guess that was good."
732,sarc,"i love how you think atheism is evil when you worship a vengeful god full of hatred, according to your own religious text."
733,sarc,"i love how you cling to hope that your god exists. dont you think its about time to stop the denials and face the facts? you actually believe that god has no time to help all of the starving people,  indeed. christianity are a fool for thinking that god is a good person"
734,sarc,i love how you managed to advocate reading the bible all the while pile slamming insults on it. pure brilliance. :d
735,sarc,"i love how the athesists respond, they claim to not debate thesists, but they follow debate religion like it's their religion. we (this writer) has never professed not to debate theists. this is a debating society. there are theists within it. therefore no illusion can be made that atheists do not herein debate theists."
736,sarc,and i love it how you attempt to once again change the subject when you have been proven wrong and have nothing more to support your position. can you stay on topic and reply to my previous rebuttal of your nonsense?..
737,sarc,i love it how no mention of bush can go long without the word nazi! emoticonxrolleyes
738,sarc,"i love it how you every time someone disagrees with you, you call it 'attacking' :|"
739,sarc,"i love it when straight homophobes tell us what it is to be gay. i am a woman, maybe i should tell all the fellas that it really don't get hurt when they get kicked in the balls. emoticonxrolleyes"
740,sarc,"i love it when 'heathens' try to tell me what my religion does or doesn't do. emoticonxrolleyes  ah yes, here come the personal attacks. duo must be getting desperate again."
741,sarc,"i love it when you left wingers put president bush's intelligence down......you forget that he had a higher gpa at yale then kerry did......... the president is dumb like a fox..........he beat you in 2000, beat you in 2002, beat you worse in 2004..... if he is dumb, what does that make you lefties?"
742,sarc,"i love it when people do this. 'you have to prove everything you say, but i'm allowed to simply make assertions and it's your job to show i'm wrong.'"
743,sarc,"i love it when hypocrites say that we are no longer old testament law but proceed to quote the old testament that they just dismissed making themselves out to be fools and hypocrites. you can not have it both ways. either the old testament applies, or it does not. also, do you play football, wear polyester, stuff like that? those are abominations too. for more abominations, read leviticus 11. damn, this is a jolly good time!"
744,sarc,"i love it when you make the 'flat earth' argument! i suppose the same goes for the 600 scientists who recently signed a petition voicing their disagreement with the ipcc's alarmist conclusions and even showed up at the recent kioto 2 conference to protest and try to get their voices heard. 2 of them are nobel award winning scientists.  before you make the typical argument that they are all secretly working for oil co's, the same could be said about those scientists that support the man made gw argument, after all, that's how they get funding for their research, scare the daylights out of the politicos and enough of their constituents and they throw endless amounts of funding your way."
745,sarc,i love when differing from someones opinion is 'weak'. such a convincing argument.
746,sarc,i so love it when you have to work so hard to avoid any points i made. i take it as assent to my original post.
747,sarc,i still love it how ethmi thinks that defaulting on our massive debt is less important then obama's dubious ties to dubious people.  what a tool. or maybe he didn't realize that the poll was public? emoticonxbye
748,sarc,i totes love how your arguments doesn't even tell us what your answer is since you laughed a question that had two sides open for agreement or disagreement.
749,sarc,he is. it is like i sin a few times now i am a satanist. i was not aware that i could not have an opinon without being a satanist. you have been a christian longer: does god hate lying lips?
750,sarc,"ah, the ignorent american consumer/cattle has something to tell a philosopher... 'get a life' what is that, some sort of slogan for a new weight-loss product? ha, 'get a life'. who cares about real issues, right? instead let's all go to wal mart and look for cool new stuffs and then eat some mcdonalds and complain about nascar and how people are always so this and that... and let's go see die hard 4 in theaters, and let's talk on our cellphones about what we always talk over and over again to all of our myfavs and let's watch fox news and the o'reilly factor, and listen to how our father 'george w' is saving the world from all those 'ignant' terrorist who just hate us because we are free...  yeah, a philosopher would like you to think that he is boring."
751,sarc,yes let's all cheer on the glorified shameless point-farming bitch of this site.
752,sarc,"much of the land you propose that people should just move to is uninhabitable. yeah, let's all go live in deserts and mountains. let's build cities, schools, and factories on the sides of mountains and in grasslands where resources are low to continue living our industrialized lives."
753,sarc,"let's all listen to one religious book and base our laws off of that, regardless of any other beliefs that may exist, especially when regarding something that has little to no effect on anyone but those directly involved. that makes sense."
754,sarc,"wow, lets all clap for that great argument for evolutionism. finally you are cheering for the correct side. personally, i'm not sure why this is being brought up again. it is funny how many of you religious people are so sure of your faith, but can't stand to see other people talk about how observable data doesn't fit with it."
755,sarc,"see you know, lets all sign a petition to ban the doctor!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you know prodigee was right all along!"
756,sarc,"fine lets just all be on our own, fuck government, fuck state, fuck town, fuck family, lets all do what we feel so long as it makes us happy. there has to be an order to things if not there will be chaos, history has proven this time and time again, but if you think that's the way to live be my guest, you will not live to long, the universe seeks balance and order not chaos. yes power will corrupt this is the reason for the system we have, like family, town, state, government and un to prevent the power hungry from taking over, it is up to us to prevent that from happening, we the people are the world not some lone wolf."
757,sarc,"fine lets just all be on our own, fuck government, fuck state, fuck town, fuck family, lets all do what we feel so long as it makes us happy. that is you doing the same damn thing, hypocrite."
758,sarc,"jesus has always existed, he is god, and god has existed before all man or anything at all. alexander the not-so-great must have have been one of the biggest std spreaders in history than!!! lets all praise him for the great things he has done like spreading stds!!!"
759,sarc,"let's all listen to one religious book and base our laws off of that, regardless of any other beliefs that may exist, especially when regarding something that has little to no effect on anyone but those directly involved. that makes sense. lets all listen to one scientific theory and base our laws to teach that the earth is round. that doesn't make sense"
760,sarc,oh really? anybody can say that they are a always a guest on here and then all of a sudden come . nice try for an excuse.
761,sarc,"oh really? then please provide me with several links that prove i'm an idiot or shut the fuck up! considering you only have 30 points i'm not too sure just how much you could possible know about anyone on this site? come on dude! you're a troll and everyone knows it... stop your trolling, grow up and hang with the big dogs... if you can't then close your fucking troll account and go bye bye."
762,sarc,"oh really, this is a debate site? then wouldn't you agree that members should debate as opposed to belittle and mock? forgive me if i'm mistaken, but there's a difference between simply disagreeing with something, and hating something."
763,sarc,"oh really? lots of people would object to sitting around doing nothing in school? really? last i checked students are always complaining and would much rather do nothing in class, than learn. and with meditation, it would help tremendously, reduce stress, help creativity, spur imagination, stay focused, learn to love, less bullying, better eating, better health, better everything..."
764,sarc,"oh really? ever voluntarily flown in a plane by any chance? taken medication for anything, or received a vaccination?"
765,sarc,oh really? where might i see this cowboy? might i have some evidence to support your appalling claims? pick any cowboy movie .. any
766,sarc,"oh really? people were born gay? that's insane....don't drag god into your crazy notions of homosexual genetics... you have no proof....'therefore, since he also allowed other animal species to be born gay' its funny how would use unreasoning animals to justify homosexual behavior... i guess if everyone did stuff like that most of us would have multiple sexual partners(male lions),we would be murderers, thieves, rapists, and pedophiles just because animals engage in these behaviors...."
767,sarc,"oh really? is that apparently so? i don't believe that. allow me to show you error in your beliefs. god knows everything,correct?"
768,sarc,774 billion to china in debt... where are you going to 'buy' new technology? oh right... from china.
769,sarc,i was not trying to convince anyone. so what the hell is your point man? oh right there is no point. you are just trying to be an uncouth lout.
770,sarc,"did you really post that shitty argument? do something else with your brain.. oh right, you're incapable of it. xoxo"
771,sarc,"atheists believe in god.... they just don't want to believe in god because they are in rebellion to god maybe in your mind, because you can't see a world without god. a parallel is that of a parent and child. so atheists are naughty children? and he or she then rebells to the point of extreme anger. atheists are extremely angry? oh right, like those atheist terrorists, or the atheists that campaign at the funerals of dead soldiers. atheists are just angry at god for no real reason care to prove this?"
772,sarc,"nor do i understand how buying materialistic items or receiving them is very christian yes!!! thankyou!!! i'm glad someone finally said it! now what was one of the deadly sins of christianity? oh right, greed. hypocrisy much?"
773,sarc,"accountable by trial? by following the advice given to them? when people screw up, they are culpable for trial. how about holding the advisors accountable? oh wait!! how about holding the people who put the advisors in power accountable? oh shit!!! hold the government accountable! hold the people who put government accountable. hold every citizen accountable. when you're done acting hysterical, let's get back on topic. nice work, captain hindsight. you put yourself at trial. 'i shouldn't have acted like i know more about drilling for oil than oil companies'. apparently you are easily influenced by television. to recap: when an oil company screws up by cost-cutting, which leads to a major environmental disaster and the loss of eleven lives, we hold them accountable by trial. committees like the one which found bp et al culpable are instrumental in building a case against bp."
774,sarc,"who says there is an afterlife? oh wait, people from two thousand years ago before science. hmmm."
775,sarc,"if god is supposed to be omnibenevolent, why should we fear him? oh wait, he kills children..."
776,sarc,"isn't that amazing that you were the fool all along? oh wait, you are to simple-minded to understand that. carry on."
777,sarc,"ignoring the fact that the wealth of the 1% comes from the labor of the other 99%. try running a multi-billion dollar business without any workers, and see how that works out. if the workers are better, why don't they start a new business to compete against them? oh wait, they can't, this is not free market capitalism, this is crony capitalism, which is supplied by the very people whom you fervently trust, the cronies in government."
778,sarc,"what are they doing at the marshals service anyway besides losing two way radios? maybe, they should just radio it in to find them, oh wait, they can't, they are lost."
779,sarc,"my debate. i say when we're done. another childish response. you from britain? oh wait of course you are, you're mic."
780,sarc,your face is always red??? oh wait! your real face.... hehe
781,sarc,"hmmm? why would you say that? it makes no sense.. competition is what pays the bills... oh wait... i know, you want to receive the sickest bastard on cd award! i hope you aren't being a pedophile again?"
782,sarc,"yes..but what is the difference between killing for fun and killing by mistake???? you drive your big suv to work every day...how many animals do you accidently kill? how many insects? oh wait, you judge a life by how big the life is...ignorant humans!"
783,sarc,"be homophobic... like the naacp? oh wait, they're left wing. call for war... like the democrats for vietnam? oh wait, they're left wing. be racist... like claim that minorities can't help themselves? oh wait, that's also left wing. sir... you've engaged in stereotyping... that makes you... hmm."
784,sarc,"so tell me what was his most prudent action during the first term.... was it going into iraq? or maybe giving huge tax cuts to the rich and blowing the budget surplus?  oh wait, i know! it was pulling out of the kyoto treaty, alienating foreign countries, and asking congress to pass the patriot act! no, no... it has to be when he found out about 9/11 and did absolutely nothing for like ten minutes.  i hope you sense the sarcasm. bush didn't do a good job in his first term. and he didn't do well in his second either."
785,sarc,do you believe there is a god? i answered the question.... i don't see where it asked for anything other than my opinion. are you seeing things that aren't there? oh wait... look who i'm talking to.
786,sarc,depends do you put any thought into writing your arguments? oh wait you don't never mind.
787,sarc,good thing this argument has never been done!...oh wait. With that logic we should make everything legal. You are much better off making theft legal and safe (no more guns needed!) than to have it illegal and dangerous. 
788,sarc,"Wow BIOLOGISTS have been working on strteches of DNA of previously unknown function and found what they went looking for - function. That sure knocks genetics and evolution off its feet. Yep no question about it at all. Darwin will be trashed when junk DNA is explained, all his predictions about junk DNA being functionless will be falsified. Oh, oh wait a second. Darwins theory and the NDS make zero predictions about ""junk"" DNA! Guess that if one has nothing to falsify then falsification is pretty unlikely. "
789,sarc,You know what I find amusing here...your entire argument revolves around how it will affect your wallet. Forget about the lives of the people who are denied rights in this country that you take forgranted. That is the true christian-American spirit isn't it? Oh how proud our forefathers would be if they could see us now...oh wait...most of them owned people...nevermind. 
790,sarc,"oh yeah, 'cos that bible you have is so much more moral than songs that swear! :)"
791,sarc,"QUOTE  oh yeah god is the root of all evil! tell that to the person who was about to murder their spouse for cheating but refrained from doing so because they believe that god is watching.END QUOTE how about that damn evil mother theresa too  now why would someone murder an adulteress in the first place? oh, right! the bible punishes adultery with death. mother teresa was no longer faithful at the time of her death. she realised the lack of voice of jesus, the lack of presense."
792,sarc,"FILTER BY LACK OF ENGLISH WORDS. oh yeah..???????? emotion is juz lyk the engine vch pulls da coaches n help'em 2 reach 2 der destinantion as da coaches've no destination 2 move or 2 b pulled....da same way, if der's no emotion how da hell man can accomplish his goal nd destination......my dear competent frnd.....most probably u've forgotten da 'v r human beings'."
793,sarc,"oh yeah because the septics on this site are so much better!! anyway i dont think brits are desparate to reclaim lost glory, if their proud of the country their proud it's just that, there's no way britain could become the superpower it once was and i dont think it would help the country anyway. if by lost glory people mean sport then of course they are the same as any other country gets behind its national team but that is rarely britain except for the olympics otherwise its england, scotland, ireland and wales normally play as separate countries (eg the football)"
794,sarc,"violence, death, conflict, etc. yet god is the one who condones all that. in fact who considers most of it right. BEGIN QUOTE he doesn't care about what's right and not right. END QUOTE oh yeah, god really does not care about those at all. considering all that he regards as good (slavery, raping, killing children, etc.) BEGIN QUOTE he has no remorse for his actions.END QUOTE  it just gets better and better... BEGIN QUOTE sure, you don't have to worship him,  END QUOTE only an idiot would worship god. BEGIN QUOTE but i don't think he encourages people to grow and live their life the 'moral' way. END QUOTE this is so true. god is not moral, not even remotely close."
795,sarc,"can ukraine and belarus come back i miss the motherland, oh yeah i cannot agree more!!!"
796,sarc,"oh yeah of course you will, and while your at it you will be a genocidal dictator and people will still love your god damn country instead of wanting to change it back! lol very funny!"
797,sarc,"oh yeah! obama really rocks! he really deserved this.!!!ok, so, obama, deserves this. let's go obama let's go!"
798,sarc,"oh yeah i forgot, the government is out to get you. okay, carry on with your crazy ass. that is absolutely absurd, get fucking real, i just don't trust them. government only cares about one thing, destroying liberties and gaining power! 'the government needs to be exposed because it cannot be trusted to expose itself, the light of day and the light of truth are the best disinfectants for the government.' lies"
799,sarc,"oh yeah, i almost forgot... what about all the plants, weeds, trees that were under water? many of them wouldn't be able to survive, like cacti, so did ole noah have to bring all that stuff along too? man! i hope that boat was big."
800,sarc,"oh yeah, it's a real brain teaser. who would have thought it's possible for someone to have two parents?"
801,sarc,"oh yeah, all the most famous scientists, composers, writers, bands. all girls of course.... no, not really. yeah whitney huston, obviously way bigger than the rolling stones, beatles, who, led zeplin...... yeah great. take a step back, and read some good literature, you might learn something, un biased. opera the most powerful woman on earth> if she is, why will she die in the next 30-40 years, and how come i had never even heard of her until a little while back? how come, if she is so powerful, she is not out curing terminal diseases. oh i guess sitting on some leather sofa trying to get more ratings is way better!"
802,sarc,"oh yeah, they made all that stuff up for people who believe in that ;)"
803,sarc,oh yeah because someone else getting involved and helping them wage war on palestine for daring to live in their own country is really likely to prevent the war from escalating.
804,sarc,"oh yeah, that's right.... i forgot ;) i'm getting dementia already ;) well, i guess that if i don't make it to heaven (due to all the liberals i've tormented over the years) i'll be so busy shaking hands with all of my friends that i wont have time to worry ;)"
805,sarc,"reproduction oh yeah, because our 7 billion high population, with estimates for 10 billion by the end of the century, really needs to force gay people to do it. if the person is religious in the christian religion, it only damns those who sleep with another man as he does a women. your sexual orientation itself is not bad. and anyway, it's their own problem, love the sinner, hate the sin, as jesus said. i'm not sure about other religions specific text against gays. if he wants to. i talked about how people shouldn't be forced to, i said that some people could."
806,sarc,you're fucking kidding me right? you do realize no matter which one of us is right it's still fucked up right?  god flat out blatantly allowed satan to torment job and kill people.  and you justify that by saying he was given a new family?! oh yeah they gave him a new wife and new kids that makes it allllllll better. just replace those god allowed to be killed for some stupid test. fucking christians and their fucked up twisted morality.
807,sarc,"yes there is life after death because in hell there will be weeping,screaming,and gnashing of teeth because people are suffering because they choose not to believe in god and just how srom1883 said that its not god that sends people to hell its the the person who decides not to believe in god and do it there own way when there is only one way to heaven and thats through jesus christ alone. oh yeah, great. care to back that up with some hard evidence? (fairy tale books don't count, sorry)."
808,sarc,your comparing us to animals? that is really sad man. most animals? so their are animals that in your opinion are....cooler then us? what the heck does cooler mean anyways? oh yeah knowledege led us to a better future...... oh look we have nuclear warfare! so much better! oh look we have weapons that can wipe out this whole planet and bring us into an ice age! dude thats so freakin awsume! oh yeah were learning from our mistakes alright! hey werent we supposed to pull out of this freakin war in the middle east! but nooooooo we are launching missiles on libia thats solves alot..... because we gained so much knowledge and learned from our mistakes! if you pay attention to what is really going on and open your eyes to the cruel reality of human nature you would understand how desperate we are in need of a savior.
809,sarc,oh yeah so our tax dollars pay for there asses to live in our prisons? no thanks our tax dollars are the ones feeding and bedding there asses
810,sarc,oh yeah. way easier. which is why gay marriage has come such a long way since it started. ;) marriage would only be removed from any legal document. it will still appear in religious documents. the compromise will be a hell of a lot more amicable than the tension that currently exists.
811,sarc,"islamic countries have extremely sexist laws against women in an islamic country a women can be put to death for any of the following offenses walking without a male escort, driving, being raped, using the bathroom without permission, being seen in public with a man other than her husband, getting an education, or even having a job, don't believe me look up sharea law i may have misspelled that but whoopty fucken do. also the middle east is a hot bed for violent muslim extremists. hmm i wonder ware the hot bed for violent christian extremists is? oh yeah that's right nowhere."
812,sarc,"oh yeah, but its okay to say that george bush is a criminal is it? no one wants to be fair then do they, lets be fair only when a democrat gets in trouble!"
813,sarc,"oh yeah, there's a whole section of the country (the grain belt or maybe the midwest) that eats these things 2 or 3 times a day. sometimes even for desert.... ...okay i was kidding about that last part, but still."
814,sarc,"i just told you how. if you want to change your gender, then go ahead... but comparing it to changing clothes is just idiotic.  oh yeah! i forgot, you already think the entire human race is stupid... so i guess you have an excuse."
815,sarc,"oh yeah i remember reading that if gay people got married heterosexuals would end up loving each other less!!! anyway the overall meaning of marriage was destroyed the moment religous people started getting divorced, if the church no longer frowns upon man splitting that which god has joined together then has the overall message of marriage not been destroyed already?"
816,sarc,"oh yeah, because kids can't tell the difference between a video game and real life, they'll pick it up, shoot their family and things its a game, right?"
817,sarc,yes there it is the word that is favorited by the liberals!!! biiiiiiigot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! oh yeah!!!!!!!! it's not a sin to be temped but you don't need to fall into your temptation and do what is tempting you. and yes you are demon possessed.
818,sarc,"oh yeah? you can't out-post me! i type about 20 wpm. i still look at the keyboard when i type... which means, ultra-focus! i can switch between my right index finger and my left index finger. i'm a posting machine... try me."
819,sarc,"'they give both sides of the isle a chance to talk.' oh yeah, us liberals are free to talk on fox...  we just aren't allowed to defend ourselves when our statements are taken out of context, correct you when you misquote or misread soemthing for the benefit of your stance on a topic, or have the last word.... other than that, we may speak...."
820,sarc,"oh yeah, you got me. bigotry and hate are major turn on for me. you could use a good lay anyway. muah. ;0"
821,sarc,oh yeah i forgot! you hated on me a couple of times before! thanks for the reminder. ;)
822,sarc,"no. go back 6 million years ago ... oh yeah! i forgot that you lived back then... okay, but all joking aside, we can't really know. however, if the bible is correct, then they did believe in god. you know, 'cause he directly spoke to them."
823,sarc,"lmao seriously i rarely show emotion, but that's funny. 1. how does that compare to 9/11 exactly? 2. at least that guy was aprehended, where's osama again? oh yeah that's right, we were busy in a random country in the mid-east because some president's daddy was there and jr wanted to show how cool he was. bush should have stuck to bankrupting professional baseball teams and oil companies. and conservatives have no leg left to stand on... literally your pirate avatar is fitting as insulting as you would wish it were. take out your peg leg and try to stand on an issue. current republicans = bought and owned by private interest. those sad soles defending it = easily persuaded and uneducated. i know because i'm an elite liberal. i regularly laugh at how dumb you are."
824,sarc,"ever hear of an insurance company? you know, that thing that you voluntarily pay for so that if you get hurt there is money available? oh yeah, i forgot, you're a socialist so anything private is evil and greedy and government is a magical thing. ps: at the end of the day, i still know how to run my life better than you do, so keep your nose out of it."
825,sarc,"oh yeah..., how long does it take to walk from one end of the country to the other? ;)"
826,sarc,"oh yeah..., have a big burly homosexual with a raging hard-on coming fast towards a little naked skinny dude.... i'll bet you the little naked skinny dude will run ;)"
827,sarc,"plus i think it is great for all the orphans in need of new homes. oh yeah, that's awesome! i would love to leave an orphanage to meet my two new dads!"
828,sarc,oh yeah? tell that to the next person you see running down the street wielding a knife. ;)
829,sarc,"and just how the hell is a dog going to decide, 'oh yeah, it's just gorgeous, i think i'll wear it to the ball this evening...'?"
830,sarc,"oh yeah, i totally bought adobe photoshop too. i definitely did not illegally download it, because that would be wrong. ;)"
831,sarc,"oh yeah man, i'm feeling the love, everything is one and i'm one with everything, there are no distinctions, reality is just an illusion right? what do you call someone who is out of touch with reality?"
832,sarc,"do you know what a marriage is under the law? oh yeah, that's right, a legal union. they are the exact same thing just with different names, its like if i had two identical roses and called them joe and sam, they're still both the same rose."
833,sarc,"oh yeah..., my fiends did that for me. they had an intervention and they vented. they were pissed me for mercilessly trolling them and it worked. i am now a kinder, gentler, troll ;)"
834,sarc,"it's the same kind of remark you made to sandy. what is the matter, you can dish it out but you can't take it? oh yes.. i forgot. all the wives you ever had divorced you. never mind."
835,sarc,oh no you didn't! not g earnst website?  oh yes you did! that would be like me quoting from nato's website.  po tow mack institute emoticonxsmilie  potomac river humm.
836,sarc,"oh yes... and there also needs to be a loaded gun with a single bullet in the chamber there sitting next to their huge book of lies... so that when this poor xxxxx finally despairs they can at least have an easy way out... your an idiot plain and simple. i dare you to talk to the mothers of those young teens that took there own lives cause of their sexuality and see what they have to say.... regret, pain, and suffering because they were too blind to see past their bible...."
837,sarc,"oh yes, the flood that left no trace of ever occuring. gotta fear the threat of nothing! i'm so afraid of a flood that never happened!  as for sodom, well, i practice good hospitality. i don't know about you. you know, god isn't going to be happy when you keep limiting its power by calling it a 'he' all the time. god is limitless, it has no gender."
838,sarc,oh yes. the holocaust never happened and the nazis were innocent aryan wonder-men. =d :)
839,sarc,"oh yes...because mainstream science is concocting one big hoax just to brainwash you. it's a conspiracy of rabid scientists. emoticonxrolleyes we all know you know much more that scientific peer reviewed journals and the scientific method, right? you're scientific credentials?"
840,sarc,"oh yes, that time when you were on two ships at the same time in different oceans? or how about when you were a mid level naval officer who suddenly became a high level army advisor to the south vietnamese?  you're lying."
841,sarc,"huh. explain why you call people bush haters and use personal attacks yourself when you're running out of ammo? oh yes, it's because you're a hypocrite. i'm voice of treason, i can call people all the horrible names i want, but the minute they say one bad thing about me, i whine like a little girl about how it;'s so unfair and how they are meanies!"
842,sarc,oh yes.  and people say the vatican is dealing with pedophilia molestation by glorifying one of the worst offenders in recorded history. :p
843,sarc,"oh yes, i amsure one read of your posts and every gay man will go ex-agy {/sarcasm]"
844,sarc,"define 'real.'  please, how are those all conservative?  national security is a part of both. low taxes? since when was low taxes conservative? oh yes never. reform ss? that's no conservative either. conserativism dictates that we kill the thing. tort reform? when was that ever a part? small business, since when were republicans for small business when they are subsidizing large corporations who have a history of buying out, running out of town and shutting down small business."
845,sarc,"that wasn't a reason why we fought hitler. in fact, if you will remember many in the states didn't believe that occured until they saw the pictures.  hardly a reason to invade. unless you'd like to flip it around and say that every country who's leader we tried to murder has the same right. emoticonxrolleyes  how is that our problem? oh yes, it's not.  as i recall, we kicked him out, beat him up, put him under sanctions and virtually removed any ability to do anything of revelance.  doesn't that mean we have to invade north korea? emoticonxrolleyes  that's been dealt with already. rehashed arguments are worthless.  huh. stalinist govermemnt. reminds me of the dictators the us put in power in latin america. :) the mass graves also was dealt with. but then again, you clearly do not understand the me culture."
846,sarc,"why? that doesn't make alot of sense. we say gas go over $2 during a period of relatively low demand. why would gas stabalize that a price that is lower then what it was during a period of low demand when high demand is projected with increases consumption in china the us and the industralized world as a whole? oh yes, i'm asking the person who thinks that cds are good investments during periods of low inflation. emoticonxrolleyes"
847,sarc,"oh yes liberal: anyone who disagrees with vor regardless of their political standing. you would call frist a liberal if he disagreed with you, hell you would even goldwater a liberal if he disagreed with you.  i'm going to mentally replace farfignewgin whenever you say liberal, after all, they have the same meaning in your context.  you can support the troops by disagreeing with any mission that is unncessary in terms of security and any mission that puts troops in unncessary danger. explain to me how you can support the troops by supporting a mission that doesn't help america and gets 1600 of them needlessly killed."
848,sarc,"uh...how does that work? oh yes, comming from the person who thinks a cd is good during times of low inflation, it does not suprise me you do not even understand the basics of taxation."
849,sarc,"oh yes... when someone disagrees with you, bring on the irrelavent rhetoric."
850,sarc,oh yes and i canyt read books ask questions. so i know nothing about how saddam was ' no threat' well he was a few years ago. now hes not cuz we found the coward in a hole.
851,sarc,"oh yes. that's why the brits took fast and sure measures to round up the islamofascist jerks. wish we could do the same here, oh yes, i almost forgot.we are!!"
852,sarc,"oh yes, the kkk, that 'rightous' chrisitan orignization. it is stil quite active in the south, particularly in many of the bible belt states, and east texas"
853,sarc,"i assume you are christian? do you follow everything in the bible? i guess you better get stoning of your neighbors going then for working on sunday and wearing blended fabric. oh yes i do take offense that you want to kill gay people since you believe that you can't ignor some parts of the bible. you are then comanded to kill gay people, prostitutes, and smartmouthed children."
854,sarc,oh yes...i masquerade as an atheist and a 6-day creationist at the same time to try to appeal to a wider audience.
855,sarc,"i do like written constitutions very much; and our constitution is not vague at all. in the first amendment, the question is not whether congress may make a law, but rather what is 'the freedom of the press?' this phrase has objective, historic meaning, and obscenity is not covered within that objective, historic meaning. neither, by the way, is the publishing of nuclear secrets. you have gathered incorrectly, for i do not want a direct democracy. how do you suppose we got 'civil rights' recognized in the constitution to begin with, matthew? did the words just magically appear there, or did a vast majority of people vote to put them there? oh yes, that's right, a vast majority of people voted to put them there. darn evil democracy! i say down with majority rule!"
856,sarc,"oh yes matt, i'm just an angry little ogre who can't stand to think that gays might find happiness in this lifetime, [sarcasm]. get a clue matthew, i have no personal investment at all regarding your life or your lifestyle. all i'm doing is sharing the spiritual truths that you hate to hear or consider. don't blame me because you live a life of delusions and self deception, because that is the life you are living. and none of those so called good people who encourage and show tolerance for your chosen lifestyle are your friends at all. and yet you prefer their lies to my truth. go figure huh?"
857,sarc,oh yes those horrible wicked gays that will distroy families and consume morality as we know it.
858,sarc,and neither did god write them. they were writen by men and there was no devine inspiration. there is no difference between the bible and margaret mitchell's gone with the wind. oh yes i am sorry gone with the wind at least gets history correct.
859,sarc,"oh yes, and nobody in the history of the universe has ever been killed by anything besides a gun. for that matter, there aren't many nuts with guns around here. the thing is that the media won't make money if it says 'kid walks grandma safely across street'. what will bring in the bucks is 'kid walks grandma halfway across street, pushes her in front of semi-truck, and eats the remains'."
860,sarc,"oh yes. it is much safer for conservatives to just go on o'reilly's show or interview with fox news. heaven forbid they ever be challenged on their views, cause they just may start thinking about knocking teeth loose instead of answering real questions with real answers ... emoticonxwow < end sarcasm > huckabee has been on stewart's show multiple times before. he'll be back. he isn't afraid to be challenged. stewart's nowhere near as bad as you make him out to be. the extremists get annoyed with stewart, but i think the main problem they have is not regarding a lack of civility, but rather cause he shines a light on the cockroaches and rust in the conservative thinking process. what did stewart say that was actually lacking in civility or warranting 'teeth' loosening? does huckabee even have a show?"
861,sarc,"oh yes, christians are the people who strive to lose their virginity before marriage...not really. you will most likely hear more about christian people losing their virginity because it is more out of the ordinary (or the people are nominal christians) for example, the news broadcasts nearly every plane crash, but there are far more car accidents. i find it humorous that so many leftists try to label the right as racist or discriminatory in some way, and then comments like that are made. its all very hypocritical."
862,sarc,"oh yes that was very enlightening, could i get the stick drawing anyway?"
863,sarc,"oh yes we do think so. as you know very well where that figure came from.  the latest study at harvard. new study finds 45,000 deaths annually linked to lack of health coverage | harvardscience interesting, isn't it, how our side is always quoting figures from harvard and such, and all your ilk can dig up is 'townhall' and hannity's second grade collages."
864,sarc,"compared to speaking all that is into existence, these events were childs-play for my father in heaven. these are much easier to believe/accept than your magic of the big bang event spontaneously occurring with no trigger or determinable origin. then the spontaneous appearance of life on earth from that puddle of primordial ooze. oh yes snakepit, as easy pointed out so poignantly, that's not believing in magic, is it!!!"
865,sarc,reckon if a rock could think it would have a concept or two.
866,sarc,"that's me, and proud of it. but i guess you get your jollies when pagan religious symbols or a pagan religious event can be displayed / practiced, but to heck with anything that might resemble christianity? real nice and equitable there, moose.  it got me a lot of 'excellent!' and 'way to go!' remarks from a number of co-workers.  bull. i've seen it, though it's been many decades now. get real. halloween itself is a pagan religious event, if you will do some research for a change. once again, pagan-related religious themes are fine, but screw the christians.  aren't you one of the libs who tries to sell their 'tolerance' (except for anything christian)? reckon so."
867,sarc,"reckon you'll be eating your own words in due time, moose.  not from what i've seen so far in your posts. keep plugging, though, you may find god yet when you run out of all those ill-conceived arguments against him."
868,sarc,"there it is, at the top in bold letters. reckon you can find it now?"
869,sarc,"oh, how about the other states charge a special fee to inspect anything imported from kalifornia? seems like there was a little trade war going on over oj from florida and texas once and kalifornia lost.  what does the constitution of the u.s. say about powers prohibited to the states? reckon kalifornia is bound by the u.s. constitution? emoticonxagree"
870,sarc,you shouldn't bring your family into these things. lol! reckon you toads got your heads handed to you at yorktown. gotta love it. now go change your diaper.
871,sarc,Al will need to get a little fitter before the fight but I reckon he could take him! 
872,sarc,"he lives in arizona, a republican state. that explains everything."
873,sarc,"that explains your excellent use of grammar, word choice and spelling? rotflmao"
874,sarc,"well, there ya go! that explains everything gansao, we have been sincerely debating a serious issue of human development with a simpleton who gets his education from fictional tv. now i understand completely why it has been impossible to reason with him. we are officially wasting our time even communicating with such a person. emoticonxwow emoticonxdonno emoticonxfrazzled"
875,sarc,you certainly make a good point. i have found that most cat lovers are liberals. liberalism is a form of mental illness. that explains alot about cat lovers. :)
876,sarc,so you get your information on science from a creationist lawyer? that explains it!
877,sarc,"ok, the absolutly positively true story. god did exist. but, satan being the wiley deciever he is got him with that very clever paradox ploy. 'god, if you are truely all powerful, can you make yourself not exist?' satan asked. 'but of course.' he replied and with that...*poof* he was gone. that explains why he doesn't do anything. no miracles, no prayers answer, nothing...he's gone. and, for those fools who doubt this, i refer you to the book of job. witness how god jumps to the tune of satan when god withdraws his protection from his loyal and faithful servant...merely to prove a point to satan...without cause!"
878,sarc,"what is not only illogical but patently false is the assertion that the unborn baby is making his mother a slave of any kind. did that baby force her to conceive it? is that baby the equivalent of a tumor as the pro abortionists claim them to be? no, it is an unborn human being who just needs the time to grow and develop in order to be a sentient being just as we are as we type on these keyboards.  that explains everything about how irrational you are! but based on your posts though, i think they already pulled the plug. emoticonxfrazzledemoticonxdonno  "
879,sarc,"what a shock, tq is once again on the wrong side of an issue, and decides to make a spectacle of himself by highlighting the fact that he is completely incapable of understanding basic literary principles. for one, the principle that a man means what he writes. btw, where's jake in all of this? he seems to have gone mia. emoticonxrolleyes"
880,sarc,what a shock. none of this has anything to do with what i wrote.
881,sarc,"what a shock. easy can't make a cogent point, so he starts ranting scripture and threatening damnation. let me type up his response: '<flush> let's see how smart you are when you're suffering in the pit, you obama-ade drinker.'"
882,sarc,"wow, attacking an argument i haven't even made yet. classy.  arguing the morality of something has nothing to do with religion for me which is why i argue on the morality of the actual act. if you were just going to regurgitate a religious excuse for your answer, as you seem to imply, then yes i would oppose it on those grounds, but if you can't think of a reason prostituion is morally wrong except for your religious answer then you are doing yourself a disservice. the only predictable one here seem to be you."
883,sarc,"wow you can piss standing up, that's loads better than multitasking, manipulating, linguistics and arts. well done you!"
884,sarc,"wowwwwwwwww. you learned how to say something other than 'you are going to hell'. did your mother teach you that, or are you just copying what i'm doing? cuz i doubt you are smart enough to learn anything by yourself."
885,sarc,wow. that shows that my short term memory sucks. ok the 'kitchen' isn't any area in particular. you enter the kitchen by uttering insults.
886,sarc,wow nice job! the 50 character limit is hard to reach and it is a waste of time but up vote for you!
887,sarc,"wow, there you go again. first we can cut health care costs by hiring lots and lots of doctors and nurses and building lots more hospitals... which have to be, you know, paid for. now we can cut postal rates by hiring lots and lots more delivery people! who have to be, you know, paid. in your view it seems that any cost can be reduced by spending more money... it's fascinating really."
888,sarc,"wow, you have a g.e.d. what happened? dropped out of high school? or did you flunk out? judging by you sentences (if you can call them that), you flunked out. and as for me, i have a computer engineering associates degree and i'm working towards my bachelors of science in computer engineering, so keep that in mind. i suppose the 'really important things' that you are learning that aren't reading and writing is how to roll a joint or take lsd since i couldn't imagine what a person who still lives in his mom's basement learns."
889,sarc,"wow, your sex life is based on relativity? i assumed you were quick, but not that bad."
890,sarc,"wow, halloween as tolerance education! how unique! i bet there's a university thesis in there somewhere. you've really hit the head on the nail this time. er, i mean...."
891,sarc,wow! i've never thought about it like that. you've given that a lot of thought ;)
892,sarc,"wow! you're only religious when it's convienent and proves your point. that's how i felt about bush, and he lasted two terms. so if there is any justice, obama will get four terms to fix it all."
893,sarc,"wow! well what do you think that thing is in a woman's womb? a giraffe? with how stupid you are, i wouldn't be surprised if you were a giraffe,"
894,sarc,"wow a down-vote and no dispute, thanks kozlov (edit: or not kozlov?)."
895,sarc,"wow. you're such a racist. 'made of cells'? wow. so what if you're not made of cells? you have something against bots, bro? sheesh."
896,sarc,really!?!?! that high!?!?! wow!!!! cool!!!! do you think i beat out larry the cable guy ;)
897,sarc,are you planning to be dead by age 40? i dunno. do you start to sag by then? wow! are you serious? his death is far worse because he's a total hottie? of course! if channing tatum died tomorrow i would cry. it's a total let down!!
898,sarc,"wow, your just full of logical fallacies today. 'nature and newscientist' here, let me use your logic... ahem these magazines are unrecognized by the scientists i like to listen to so they must be junk. furthermore, they are full of hoaxes and contradictions and are actually quite entertaining. wow, i'm learning logic from nox0 :d pointless reply from redneck, try it again with some argument."
899,sarc,"wow i really have to thank you for being so thorough with your explanations... they totally change the fact that you're comparing murder to interrogation tactics. please draw us another hyperbola, mr. hyperbolan :)"
900,sarc,"wow. someone just thumbsed this down. amazing rebuttal, simply amazing."
901,sarc,"wow, thats some poetic shit. i wonder to you roam around disagree with the people who boost about americas greatest, or how their a force for good. i wonder to you post wise ass comments next to these people. you have no idea how much of a hippocrit you are do you."
902,sarc,"wow many false gods beat an actual one. christinity may only believe in one god, the god."
903,sarc,wow you really don't like america do you? i should start calling you hate monger.
904,sarc,wow. that's an hour's research well-used! can i be your friend?
905,sarc,"so you are attracted to members of the opposite sex due to intelligence? nothing to do with hormones or desires? wow. hormones don't attract you to other people in your gender, and you don't always fall for your desires do you because some of them can ruin your life as you know it. and you know this because their opinion doesn't match yours?  from your 'anything goes' point of views you aren't very moral. yes they can learn to deny who they are ad ridicule people like themselves and wonder their whole lives if they will go to hell for feeling like they do.  quite frankly that reply made no sense."
906,sarc,"wow. just wow. burn me at the stake, why doncha? you were the only reason i stayed cuz i thought we were friends, but now that that is fucked, i will only check in to say hello to friends, and that is it. i fold. you really hurt me. you happy now?"
907,sarc,"wow, so you're saying that christianity should be able to stand the test of extreme scrutiny? are you trying to use this as an excuse to bash it time and again? great idea! i think you should spread the wealth a little! bash some hindus and buddhists and jews! oh, wait- no that is discrimination!!! you racist! i think that christianity has definitely should the test of extreme scrutiny long enough! millions of christians have been killed in history as martyrs."
908,sarc,you mean to tell me i have groupies out there? like a rock star? wow! that's news to me ;)
909,sarc,"wow! you're still going on and on about homos... you are one aren't ya... come on, just admit it."
910,sarc,"you really don't know how insurance works in this country, do you? it's not always the fault of the person for not having insurance... but you don't know this. if you choose not to get insurance that's your fault, end of story. no, education doesn't cost more because of pell grants! are you kidding me? wow. 'no, it doesn't' very convincing argument..."
911,sarc,wow. wouldn't i have banned you from this debate then. and wtf? what are you doing outside of the kitchen??
912,sarc,"wow, you're clever. and some things are dumb. ex, choosing to die when you have the option to live. your lame analogies aside, (yeah, i used the word lame again) one can find new people to hang out with. and again, instead of answering my arguement, you decide to try and insult me. you're right, i must be the one who is dumb..."
913,sarc,50 years? wow! really? is that a typo? exactly which years? from when to when? i'm confused.
914,sarc,wow. okay. photons apparently do not create light? well then i guess i have penetrated the core of your religion.
915,sarc,"wow, i'll make sure not to waste my time typing any more arguments for you from now on."
916,sarc,"wow, you just said something smart. did someone steal your account?"
917,sarc,"wow, thanks for admitting how you really feel about sex apparently. never given your so-called 'wife' an orgasm eh? i sure could...lol..."
918,sarc,"wow, that's a strong decision, there is no way ever god can exist? just a question. or are you slightly less than 7?"
919,sarc,you hate broccoli? wow! you really are a giant freak... wait...
920,sarc,so your disproven scientist work? some of the most brillant minds in our century your disproving that? wow! perhaps you didn't look correctly. there is proven information on a multiverse and a finite universe. there are maps of a possible finite universe that we live in. and also when you type something into the internet it comes up for what you are looking for not extra information like the multiverse. i am telling you there is a finite universe out there and we may even live in one. you should not disable the fact that we don't!
921,sarc,"hold on, you're truly religious? wow! how is that possible? you believe in a big magical being that controls everything because your mommy told you that was the case? if your mom told you that there was a giant pancake in the sky you would believe that. don't be such a naive fucking zealot. god isn't real, however reassuring it is to you."
922,sarc,"wow, so everyone else is just wrong. no chance you could be? i am willing to bet that you also disagree with many christians or they disagree with you at least."
923,sarc,wow. the guy on the video is certainly special... and it's difficult to type while sleep deprived and high on ginger beer.
924,sarc,"wow, good response. you know, attacking foul language instead of making a proper rebuttal makes you sound as uneducated and immature as you apparently are."
925,sarc,"""thats just the way it is"" isn't much of an argument! So, basically you don't care that some people can have rights, while others who should have them don't get them. So, I take it you liked segregation, prohabition and prefer women barefoot in the kitchen rather than at the polls voting for anything. Wow! all I an say is wow. "
926,sarc,"You mean to tell me you would deny a life to be lived out and someone to get away with a harmful crime?? wow, sounds like a liberal to me.. "
927,sarc,"yes, it is all due to capitalism. capitalism creates wealth, which develops progress in technology and knowledge.  you're joking, right? the 1900s were nearing the end of the industrial revolution nightmare, where there were no social programs to help those who were literally starving due to poverty. the stock market crash in the coming decades only made things harder for many people, and it occurred with a lack of regulation and law. i'd say that we juggled with knives the better part of the last century and got where we are in spite of capitalism."
928,sarc,"you're joking, right?!?!?! you really believe books, teachers, computers, etc. are more important than a hungry child whose parents cannot afford to pay? wow..."
929,sarc,"are you joking? i hope you're joking. no, it's not logical to believe in god. first, how did we get here? we got here because of evolution. this theory easily explains it. unless you are trolling, you should see the difference between a picture of africa and a picture from the movie avatar. if you are seriously trying to prove your god by comparing real life things with fictional things, then yes, you have proved your god is fictional. thank you."
930,sarc,"if we killed more people that were guilty of their crime more people would not want to commit the crime because of the circumstances. if they don't care about the circumstances they are insane. 'i think, about what they've done wrong in society is by teaching/encouraging/inspiring them, not killing.' so you want the government to brainwash them?  are you kidding me? what planet do you live on?! 'oh, you killed someone but we're not going to punish you at all you just have to go to therapy.' you're joking right?"
931,sarc,"i hope you're joking, otherwise i suggest you see a psychiatrist as soon as possible. people are more important than animals. you can like animals, you can even love animals, you can not want to eat animals, but when you start thinking they're more important than babies you have serious issues."
932,sarc,tennis? you're joking right? it's already been proven that women can take on a man anytime in that game! others not so much but tennis most definately!
933,sarc,you're kidding right? the quangbar tangrians will be abducting you and the rest of the human souls at the end of the world. everyone knows this.
934,notsarc,"You are a known anti-gun supporter, should we really be surprised at your presidential choice. Funny thing is, you are going to get screwed just like the rest of us if Obama wins. He might try to take our guns away, but your rights that are important to you wont be very far behind. "
935,notsarc,"it's not just alcohol and tobacco, but marijuana too; we're just still in prohibition where cannabis is consumed. organized crime surrounding its traffic? check. violent crime associated with the above? double check. lack of quality control resulting in questionable, even dangerous product? triple check! high government spending that doesn't even put a dent on the issue? you get the idea. government scare-tactic campaigns? yeah.... the overwhelming majority of us citizens try marijuana at some point in their lives, and nearly a third are believed to use it somewhat regularly- and it appears to be increasing. some limit!"
936,notsarc,"australian? damn! i guess that's what i get for looking up 'popular american bands' lol. i didn't expect that though. my favorite band is actually australian, so that's cool. guns n roses is classified as an american rock band, since the majority of the members are from america. they wouldn't say 'an american band with a guitarist who is half american and half british'."
937,notsarc,will you stop fucking talking to me? damn. leave me the hell alone. what the fuck is wrong with you?
938,notsarc,"This is not my problem. As I explained above, I just have to show inconsistency in order to reject the validity of all the claims in the Bible as being undeniable truth. And with the Bible, that's damn easy to do. "
939,notsarc,"Because when something passes every experiment thrown at it and when something fits observation better than anything else, then it's as near as damnit fact. We can get pedantic over this if you want, but the conclusion that reaches is that there are no facts. "
940,notsarc,"Certainly, because with calm empathy you can casually address such a matter simply because the struggle does not pertain to you personally.   To be able to put into question the love of another human being is simply not only alarming in nature, but damning to the very definition of love, equality, and freedom in creation of man....   And to trump this as a question of morality only serves as a mask to curtail the prejudice objections one personally has to a ceremony, right, and relationship that person will not even be personally affected by.... "
941,notsarc,"no, darling....i'm a religiously 'lax', but 'spiritually active' episcopalian. but, what if i was a believer in the nation of islam? would that justify your bigotry and racism? i think not. check the 1st amendment, which you conveniently omit."
942,notsarc,"i'm not sure how quotes from the other side of the same capitalist, warmongering coin as the republicans has any bearing on any church's support for war. the catholic church, and the us national council of churches (representing most protestant churches) opposed the war. the only church that was apparently in favour were the southern baptists, darling of the 'christian' right."
943,notsarc,john mccain is nothing more than another rino. he is the media's darling from the gop.
944,notsarc,"so your saying the first candidate in many years to actually gain a reasonable amount of bipartisan support is a republican darling? i'm not saying i agree completely with many of obama's policies, because i don't. i would just rather have a candidate who can actually do something. hillary won't be able to because she's such a polarizing figure in politics. it's better to concede some aspects of a bill in order to get it passed than not having it be passed at all because of the stubbornness of partisan politics."
945,notsarc,"quote from simone 'and, being forced to carry to term and give birth to the spawn of a rapist compounds the harm of the rape many times over.' have you thought about therapy darling ?"
946,notsarc,"darling, you're too sensitive. i've never had an issue with your debates. it was a parody of some of the new ones out. you've probably seen them, they ask a question then give yes, because and no, because for the answers when they are clearly not a question that can be answered yes or no. if i had a problem with yours, i'd be enough of a friend to kindly point it out. again, you're cool with me, don't worry.edit: i see where you've seen what i was referring to. it's early here and i'm not yet awake. but i have to get crank-started and get ready for class."
947,notsarc,"Oh dear, you're back to your nasty ad hominem self. I could have made fun of the fact that you don't know about materialism, and how its a major force behind evolution. Which is itself a suggestion that you are unaware of the socio-political forces driving western evolutionary theory.**The issue is about people behind sciences, making many different 'sciences'; based on bias, cultural/political/historical. 'Peer' doesn't mean anything because 'peers' are just people with the same background/bias etc.I notice you didn't touch upon Nationalist Sciences. Or for that matter, Capitalist Science.*You mean 'understanding' written English.**I say 'western' because there are other evolutionary theories - Marxist, Nazi, Feminist etc.Thank you, come again. "
948,notsarc,Oh dear God your ignorance is abundant!   Do you not understand what the federal DOMA law does? 
949,notsarc,"dear chloe, do you really want women tried for murder because they decide to take a pill that will cause an abortion? that is the only logical position a court can take once a zygote, embryo and fetus are legislated into the status of human beings. if one kills a human being, one is guilty of murder."
950,notsarc,"my dear lad, your emotions are too, too chaotic. still them!"
951,notsarc,"no dear! how can we foget about the people who have opened the old age homes for those whose sons have left them? those are real humans!see, we cannot be so pessimistic to look at the negative side,even if the real humans are surrounding us, the brightness of sun cannot be hidden by the patches of clouds"
952,notsarc,"dear marga,  alam naman talaga natin mali ka, kaya i accept mo na tama ang communism :) labyu."
953,notsarc,"i truly understand the significane of the issue. the parent's loss a boy that was very dear and loved by their heart. i don't have a child, but i can't put myself in their shoes. and i may not feel the full impact of emotion, but i get the sense of it. therefore, downvote.  when i said that the community was a fault. i meant that they share the blame for the boy's death. it was their actions as well that tempted the killer to kill the boy. im not saying that the criminal should be sent free tho and that it was him who chopped the boy into peices. but the community is the reason why he killed the boy. therefore, they share a part in the boy's death."
954,notsarc,"dear, as i have already said that rape is committed by persons of imbalance minds/or intoxicated persons. so, logically they can't exercise self control (and that's y we call them mentally imbalanced). i agree , that if a woman says no, it means no. but , in that state of mind a man can't understand that she is denying, what a rapist thinks is only his sexual gratification. and that's y its a crime . and we have punishments for it.. thank you for ur time. and i appreciate ur views.."
955,notsarc,"believe me, dear sir: there is not in the british empire a man who more cordially loves a union with great britain than i do. but, by the god that made me, i will cease to exist before i yield to a connection on such terms as the british parliament propose; and in this, i think i speak the sentiments of america.  thomas jefferson, november 29, 1775"
956,notsarc,"dear chatturgha, not anything having to do with vegetarians or vegans at all..."
957,notsarc,"dear david , i understand what is being asked. and as i stated ,yes it does hurt that people watch kiddy porn,it hurts me . you see , i am a victim of kiddy porn , them viewing it , hurts me. you and pyggy can alter the essence as much as you like but the answer is still yes ."
958,notsarc,"dear fucking god. why would you want to extend your life more than 30 years?  holy crap, are you mental now too, as all others seem to be? life is poison, time is pain, and every second that i exist, the closer i become to dying. life is purest misery, a clock waiting to break down. it keeps not time, but pain and suffering. the wait of pain is broken up not by content happiness, but only with brain shattering feelings of hope, soon to be smashed into infinite pieces, jagged with the dimensions of agony and memories of laughter never to come again. why do we live? it is not a miracle. it is a curse."
959,notsarc,"winston dearie you really shouldn't make such general accusations, that can get you into trouble. point them out if you can. the shooting in norway, columbine, virginia tech, the tulsa shootings and the tuscon assassination attempt weren't carried out by people a normal person could consider decent and respectable in nature and they were all massacres. you might kill somebody too. you might kill a lot of somebodies for no reason. should you be legislated against and restrained?"
960,notsarc,thanks for bringing me up to speed.. now the debate makes a little more sense. it's certainly an uninteresting theory. it's unfortunate that so many groups have tainted the eureka symbol. i promote the eureka flag to remember the importance of standing up and fighting against those that seek to deny your individual rights. http://www.ausflag.com.au/flags/eureka.html
961,notsarc,"i'm referring to chemist's assertion that mutations cause a beneficial modification to the morphology of hemoglobin. my two links say the hemoglobin becomes 'abnormal,' thus his example fails.  and you are assuming that this mutation is random. why? cancer mutations are not random...they are lead up to by epigenetic changes. why not this? http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releas...-nvo122105.php"
962,notsarc,"by far, my favourite production has been 'the complete works of william shakespeare [abridged]'. we had an absolutely fantastic time, although the script was split to accommodate a cast of twelve, rather than three. it was really just the most fun time, and we were the first show in the history of the organization to be asked to do more performances. it was great!"
963,notsarc,"maddow is pretty fantastic! she's smart, prepared, funny. puts a story in context, and knows how to do an interview - almost always one-on-one, she lets the other person speak, asks pointed questions, etc. best pundit on tv."
964,notsarc,why weren't you on createdebate lately ??? and after reading the book you will be :o the book is fantastic ...happy reading :)
965,notsarc,"i don't require permission to say that the bible is most likely a grand work of fiction. i say this for a number of reasons: . . 1) the bible contains many fantastical elements which cannot be corroborated.  . 2)we do not find fantastical or supernatural elements anywhere else in verifiable history. . 3)people living in ancient times liked to tell tall tales, fables, myths and parables. we have a plethora of examples of this. . . therefore i find it incredibly likely that the bible is a collection of tall tales, myths, fables, and parables and i find it incredibly unlikely that it is a collection of historical events. if you have good reason to think otherwise, then please present your case."
966,notsarc,"So what standards of proof do you hold the bible to? What allows you to hold it next to other religious or fantastical texts and say ""Yes, this one is definately, without fail, the word of God, and this one is not."" "
967,notsarc,"quiet the opposite. fossil records give us a snap shoct of location in time going way back. molecular biology, geology, radiography do so as well. where do you get the idea that there is no evidence? everything we have in our heads is what has been taught to us. shoulder's of giants, hun. it is observed. you and i have about one hundred non fatal mutations in our genotype. remember, most mutations are innocuous. not so. only one of a pathogenetic organism needs this and as mutation is pretty common in rappid generation organisms (bacteria) situations the 'chances' are very much in favour of it happening. remember, mutations are happening to every bacteria every generation at random."
968,notsarc,"i'm a bit surprised at the publicity this case has attracted: even here in the uk, the first item on the 10 o' clock tv news last night was a report from outside the court house (waiting for the verdict). i've never heard jackson sing and know next to nothing about his career - why has this case made such a stir in the media ? is it just a fascination with 'celebrity' ?"
969,notsarc,exactly. the force and energy involved is unfathomable really. i'm absolutely fascinated by the whole thing.  i love my job. :p  waxy
970,notsarc,"that's like making a point that if a woman didn't go out scantily-dressed, there would be no rape in the first place.  i'm flabbergasted you'd even put those two in the same category.  on a side note, where were all you folks with your outrage when this was going on a few years ago: ..... christians in gaza fear for their lives as muslims burn bibles and destroy crosses "
971,notsarc,i moved out on my own at 17.  you have a lot of life ahead of you and i'm impressed that you are keeping your child and involving yourself with these issues at such a young age. i know i wouldn't likely be doing the same if i were 17 again. i would probably be doing the same things i did before. :)
972,notsarc,"i'm intrigued as well, most of the bands are in the same size font, this could turn into a whole new debate!!"
973,notsarc,"when i was in high school lots of the kids stole stuff all the time... stuff their parents didn't want to buy them, peer pressure etc. i'm not trying to be an ass either i'm just surprised at your views on this...  maybe i'll make a debate and we can see what people on here think."
974,notsarc,"this is why i'm tempted to say the us deserves to fail. this isn't a game. don't any of you ###### understand that the time for 'us vs them' is long gone? 'your' guy is not a god, and 'their' guy is not the devil. the whole divisive nature of the us is absolutely incredible. i'm sure i'm not alone when i look on in dumbfounded disbelief at some of the posts on here. you're nation is crumbling, and rather than trying to figure out the best way to save it, some are not-so-secretly hoping the government fails so they can say 'i told you so!' others seem to think as long as they insult the 'other team' enough, everthing will be a-ok. un-believable..."
975,notsarc,"i'll check it out, if in thirty seconds i'm not impressed you'll have my answer."
976,notsarc,"not particularly. reagan was a master as crafting his image. r kelly is the teflon music star. reagan was the telfon president. he even managed to get away from the stain that was the contra affair. many of the most rabid pro-reaganites out there have no idea what that was about and how he was related. so i'm not surprised that if he could avoid being linked to a us backed rape-pillage-and murder of civilians in south america he could get away from the complicated issue of debt, borrowing and general economics which so many americans today have no understanding of."
977,notsarc,"i'm not surprised. i have more than that, i also have common sense on my side. firearms don't facilitate killing, firearms facilitate keeping criminals from getting a corner market on domination. the police are outnumbered by the criminals, the criminals are outnumbered by the law-abiding citizens. we shouldn't be unarmed when we're the majority force in maintaining the balance. too bad."
978,notsarc,"i didn't know that, but i'm not surprised by it. israel needs all the soldiers it can get.  and i disagree with you on the iran war issue. all out war with iran will have the israelis sitting on the sidelines yet again so as not to xxxx off the me allies fighting against iran."
979,notsarc,the majority of women that are of child bearing age will already have at least one child. i'm not surprised at all by this statistic - its what you'd expect it to be.
980,notsarc,"supporting administration's doctrine of pushing iraq deeper into civil war at us expense no longer has public appeal and that's where the votes are. with growing public distrust of administration and congress now at a majority, it'll take a brave or politically suicidal republican congressional member to stay the full course with current administration policy.  i'm somewhat surprised al qaeda hasn't mounted another attack on the us to keep administration in place as their fiscal irresponsibility is al qaeda's best ally. but that could backfire as administration is using iraq to display how they've kept terrorism in the us at bay and another exposed deception could further distance them from public support. al qaeda needs current administration."
981,notsarc,"however, just because the majority of people share something in common doesn't always mean the truth? very good. philosophers call this type of argument 'argumentum ad populum'. it is a fallacy that many people are prone to commit. you can choose a sonnet and correctly pick's its emotion but you can never be so sure i agree. shakespearean scholars often disagree about very miniscule details. but i think just because they are not 'sure', that doesn't mean that they can't be certain. maybe you could go google 'shakespeare sonnet 1' and read just the first poem of his sonnets collection. tell me what you think! i'm sure that shakespeare will charm you like he has charmed so many."
982,notsarc,"i'm surprised homeland security can't have gun's in dc banned. it's a federal designation, is it not?"
983,notsarc,personally i can't stand it when someone uses 'lol'. it's usually used derisively when politeness suggests that leaving it out and responding politely is in order. personally i'm surprised at this thread. the author apparently didn't read the faq.
984,notsarc,"he's one of your allies, so i'm surprised you'd think so."
985,notsarc,i'm surprised there aren't more people jumping into this one.
986,notsarc,"i'm surprised no one has mentioned the subject of quantum mechanics in this thread. it seems to be a very good example of the concept, instead of perhaps parallel lines. the fact that things can exhibit mutually incompatible properties of either a particle or a wave depending on how we observe them is incomprehensible, yet certainly reality, no? and i think this is just one example of the apparent incomprehensibility of qm . . ."
987,notsarc,i have also read that about lawsuits. these are really sick people. i'm surprised no one has charged them with child abuse as they use their young children in their attempt to terrorize other people.
988,notsarc,"as an outside observer, these are my thoughts too. it's plain selfish and stubborn as far as i'm concerned, i'm surprised that the democratic party itself isn't stepping in, maybe they are behind the scenes. waxy"
989,notsarc,i heard there were star trek cartoons back in the 70s. i'm surprised tv land or the cartoon network hasn't shown them.
990,notsarc,"assuming you're telling the truth, i have to say, i'm surprised. i truly thought you'd support something like this. i'd be interested in hearing you elaborate on your reasons for why you join with any conservative that thinks it's a bad idea."
991,notsarc,"did you ever think that the person who down voted you is the same guy who up voted me? 1. i don't down vote unless absolutely necessary. 2. i'm surprised i didn't, since that comment was useless in the first place. i just decided not to. the way you describe socialism makes it seem as if it were impossible. the government has to get involved in order to make that possible. thus, making the government control who gets what. but otherwise, how does that rebuttal what i said?"
992,notsarc,"i'm surprised, maybe your area of the uk is different, but in mine nearly all atheists are hereditary, or they just break away from the religions of their parents because they dislike their parents instead of the religion."
993,notsarc,"quite frankly,i am astounded by you homosexuals (or homosexual supporters) who claim to hate judging yet judge religious people.....those who judge and those who don't... if i were to say a controversial statement such as 'whats the point of entering an exit?' you would have been hurt or angered..yet you would make disrespectful,hatred-provoking comments that was quite the opposite of the message you were spewing just arguments prior to your comment."
994,notsarc,"that is a poor argument. if you want to become better at debate, in general, don't make statements you cannot back up, but never say that your using 'what i've been told' as an argument. your opposition will tear you apart. :)  lol, it's not like i care that much for this debate, but i will take that into consideration :) i am impressed with your willingness to debate any topic with an open mind compared to many others i have seen on this site and would enjoy debating you in a more formal structure. if you agree, of course. thank you, and of course. i'd love to debate with you."
995,notsarc,"hellno, i am quite surprised that you complain we have bad weather when axeminster lists all of those."
996,notsarc,i am really surprised this one got so many upvotes :p
997,notsarc,"well, i own a new testament (only the new) book myself. so i am really surprised that you haven't seen one before.. but whatever. what i am saying, and what random dude seem to not get, is that christianity is based on the new testament. we believe in both books.. but when people ask, what is a christian? a christian is a person who believes in jesus - jesus only exist in the new testament - therefore if the new testament didn't exist, then christianity wouldn't exist either. so that is why christianity is based (remember the word based) on the gospels."
998,notsarc,my goodness. i spoke to fast. :) i'll give you that one. i am shocked you even took the time to reply to my petty argument.
999,notsarc,i am surprised that you would agree with the president of a group that says it promotes ' individual liberties to counter the radical right. '
1000,notsarc,because they managed to convince a bunch of people that somehow by auditing the fed it would amount to a defacto takeover of the fed by congress since looking at their books and total control are obviously the same thing. i am surprised we have not seen any of the major banks using this to refuse their audits.
1001,notsarc,"fair enough. i tend to run skeptic. i am surprised that i am a theist. if you were to believe in a god, which would it be?"
1002,notsarc,"well he is defending the point for what he stands for just like you are defending the point for what you stand for. you said it yourself, you don't measure a crowd by expectations so why then are you measuring a young crowd by expectations? because of the mistakes of a few? i am surprised that you excused the mistakes of a few adults who are immature labeling them as being exceptions when you refuse to do the same for the young generation."
1003,notsarc,"well he is defending the point for what he stands for just like you are defending the point for what you stand for. i didn't say he wasn't. you said it yourself, you don't measure a crowd by expectations so why then are you measuring a young crowd by expectations? because of the mistakes of a few? i said exceptions. not expectations. i am surprised that you excused the mistakes of a few adults who are immature labeling them as being exceptions when you refuse to do the same for the young generation. it's a matter of definition. the young must be generally immature because they are not adults yet. the old must be mature because they are adult. therefore the exceptions work in different ways, an exceptional young person is mature, an exception to older people is immature."
1004,notsarc,very much so i am surprised. i'm usually a totally cynical realist.
1005,notsarc,i think so too. every father should have a right to have a say when it comes to an abortion because that fetus was formed from their chromosomes and genetics. i am surprised that advocates for abortion are saying that men have no right to tell a woman how to control her body but yet they don't have a problem with the decision of the u.s supreme court in which all of the judges were men.
1006,notsarc,"i like the band, but for a different reason... i am truly fascinated by the german language, and kulture."
1007,notsarc,"..... yeah i guess so, if you're willing to prescribe them the property of an independent 'human being'."
1008,notsarc,"i agree, it is we that it is ridicules that we have gotten so into controlling stuff that now we even have a way to control natural courses, but i guess like i said before if it is to stop your child from suffering a sickness then i guess that is okay (still bad) but better than just being a complete control freak, or being selfish"
1009,notsarc,"i don't think there should be a minimum wage i agree. i think people should be more comfortable insisting on pay increases. what do you mean? are people uncomfortable with it right now? if you are getting paid poorly...by all means...work poorly. which gets you fired. i guess if someone believes they can get higher pay somewhere else for their same skill set, they can go for it."
1010,notsarc,"well, i am a north european. i thought all europeans opened presents on christmas eve, i thought opening them the morning on 25th was an american thing. but i guess i was wrong."
1011,notsarc,only one of you i guess this is when the score card will come in handy
1012,notsarc,i didn't intend to be hostile. i guess you just interpreted the text in that manner. i'll take the blame for that as well.
1013,notsarc,"no, but i went over there and checked and i guess by time stamp you were first. ;)"
1014,notsarc,i just love how you back down. am i expected to waste my time on this? no. so why the fuck are you?
1015,notsarc,i love how viruses (viri?) and prions make us redefine our notions of life.
1016,notsarc,i love how someone down-votes me without any response it brings laughter to me whoever down-voted me because they don't have the guts to reply to me and then they down-vote me.
1017,notsarc,i love how you cons yell 'race card' when someone points out obvious ethnocentrism. yelling 'race card' does not make me any less right.
1018,notsarc,"i love how he says 'war of terror' not 'war on terror' and everyone claps. thanks for the clip, it's been awhile since i've seen that one. people don't realize but that unbridled rage and nationalism is what led to the rise of hitler and the holocaust as well as pretty much every genocide and war. 'you'll never have a quiet world till you knock the patriotism out of the human race. ' - george bernard shaw"
1019,notsarc,":d i love how no matter what we're talking about on createdebate, politics, and usually fox news, inevitably comes up. haha."
1020,notsarc,i love when she reaches for that after wards; its like a hotel bed with 'magic fingers'. shakes the whole bed to help me get to sleep.
1021,notsarc,tobi is actually obito uchiha because naruto broke off his mask and in the manga it explained how he survived and kakashi was shocked and so was guy.
1022,notsarc,why debate man ... lets all be friends         agreed with 20/20
1023,notsarc,oh really and what is successful implementation of the law then?
1024,notsarc,"care to support that with statistics? oh wait, you can't. why? because there isn't a global census on what people believe. so unless you've interviewed 7 billion people on their faith (at which point you could inform the un and several other governing bodies), i don't see how you can be in any position to claim 'religion is slowly fading.'"
1025,notsarc,"oh yeah those, i knew this girl once who put those up in her. freaky stuff man"
1026,notsarc,"oh yeah, i don't disagree. i'm a massive fan of hitchens, and 99% of everything he said was true. he just happened to be, as you say, misguided on certain issues."
1027,notsarc,"i think the debate creator is talking about lusting for another person in the biblical sense, whereby you don't actually do anything, you just look at somebody and think to yourself...oh yeah (and that of course is the same thing as adultery in the bible, so after you do that, you can look forward to the fiery lake and torture forever, etc)."
1028,notsarc,"oh yeah. it would definitely be one to remember. i'm sure every holiday with lady gaga would be one to remember. to be honest, she kinda creeps me out lol."
1029,notsarc,"for your answer to that, look at my argument about rehabilitation. oh yeah, i was just messin' around with that previous comment."
1030,notsarc,"watch this guys.  if vor believes that all life is precious, why does he support the killing of death row inmates (many of whom are likely to be innocent) ? why does he support the killing that is happening in iraq? why did he support the reagan policies that supported death squads?  oh yes, because either he's a hypocrite or has huge double standards."
1031,notsarc,"oh yes it does. you would argue that the value, the intrinic value of the rwandian genociders who chopped off limbs and raped women left and right had the same intrinic value when they were born?  a child born in iraq who emigrates to the us and grows up to be a success providing clear benefit to society has the same value as one who grows up to be a suicide bomber? no. value of a person, like all things, changes over time corresponding to their behaviors, events and what happens to them."
1032,notsarc,"oh yes, i know the one. sorry for my horrible memory emoticonxhoho"
1033,notsarc,oh yes ww one other question. are human sperm alive? are they aware?
1034,notsarc,"oh yes a bit on respiration. nematode cysts can go dormant for many years (see anguina triticii) without exhibiting any perceptible respiration or metabolism. so can tardigrades, and many bacteria and fungi. not to mention seed which are dormant sometimes for centuries. are we to conder these objects alive or dead????? are human embryos frozen at liquid n2 temps alive or dead. they certainly are not going to respire at those temps!!!!!"
1035,notsarc,"the best part, jp, was her dialing 911 while shooting at the xxxxxx. mrs. james bond? no, but pretty level-headed grandma, for sure. i bet they won't have another hold-up for awhile. if the rest of these businesses would do the same thing, that sort of job wouldn't be considered 'the most dangerous'. reckon?"
1036,notsarc,"that explains why your politician can work together i bet your current government is made of a collation ? in the uk parliament we still have a first past the post system where the party with the majority form the government.  it is slightly different in scotland we have a hybrid system of pr and first past the post, the politics in scotland has changed slightly in fact the executive is made up of a collation between two parties. this has the effect of making our politics more consensual where parties can actually discuss and negotiation solutions without party politics and vote scoring."
1037,notsarc,"i agree, i think racism is an important issue. it deals with fundamental flaws in human thinking. if 'white supremacy' exists, logic would suggest that 'black inferiority' exists, which is simply the inverse. would this also suggest that 'black supremacy' exists as well as 'white inferiority?' most likely. what does this mean? as long as we keep dividing ourselves based upon skin color, we are going to succeed in staying divided by skin color. we should really be interested in global supremacy, where everybody is happy. i think that is a statistical impossibility though, so that is why most people are just giving up. that explains the moral decline in america, but that is another topic."
1038,notsarc,the word of easy's god is evil! that explains a morally bankrupt lot.
1039,notsarc,"something you seem to have trouble doing yourself. what a shock, you find a source that doesn't agree with you 'biased'. is he a state employee? ### difference does that make? was he subpoenaed? yes. is he honouring the subpoena? no, he's ignoring it. here, how's this? it even fulfills your 'state employee' condition:alaska ag: palin subpoenas won't be honored or how about this?'mccain lawyer scrambles to block a palin ethics inquiry since her selection as running mate, there has been nothing but hurdles to overcome, and a sudden lack of co-operation from the palin camp."
1040,notsarc,"wow wow wow wow..... it depends on what you mean by science, the church i go to doesnt avoid facts. soem extreamists beleieve that people still cant prove were rainbows come from. there are close minded people everywere, why do you pick on monotheistic religions? are you not close minded to atheism then?"
1041,notsarc,wow way to take it to a level that made me think. yes now that i read that you took the debate from a joke to kind of being serious. i agree now that i read your post.
1042,notsarc,"wow. way to pull the worst thing on here. haha. ban someone for debatin? what kind of person does that? why would you do that? i mean really. but honestly, i think she's right. shut up you homo."
1043,notsarc,wow. thank you. i don't think i've ever changed anyone's mind before. this feels pretty good. :)
1044,notsarc,"#1 it offends the 14th amendment/the 14th amendment give's the government the right to appose suicide so suicide should be a crime because the government wrote down some words that allows them to decide suicide is a crime? please tell me you're joking... and #2 human life is sacred and it should not be taken prematurely by anyone. this is a non-cognitive argument. you're taking your personal preferences and deciding everyone should obey them. do you see how egotistical this line of reasoning is?  who are you to say the life was taken prematurely? it's not your life, it's not your call. those who commit suicide die exactly when they intend to, there's nothing premature about it.  i say human life is sacred, therefore no one man can chose what everyone else 'should' do and value."
1045,notsarc,you're kidding me? after all that i just told you and altarion even blocked you from posting messages onto his profile you still try to pull this shit?! how disgraceful of you! >:( this is some low shit you pulled! now i'm telling you: stay away from him!
1046,notsarc,"1. you're kidding, right? have you never watched c-span and listened to congressional inquiries? it's all q&a;and fact driven. i haven't watched tv in quite a few years, and when i did i didn't watch c span.  where are the facts that the court has cited? 2. you have the chance to clear that up (about your denials) yourself. wouldn't i have to be in denial in the first place though?"
1047,notsarc,"gay dreams are pretty common among men, but it doesn't make them gay erm.. you've had dreams about having sex with men? i think you're kidding yourself if you think that's normal for a straight guy."
1048,notsarc,"well...., i hope you're kidding because i don't think that's a fair assessment."
1049,sarc,"I think I understand this. The goal is clear, check. Self-restraint is good, check. But I do not see what this has to do with the OP. Could you explain, please? Who are you recommending should use self-restraint? The protestors? Or are you saying, self-restraint is your recommendation for birth control? "
1050,sarc,"Oh you do love to do the psychological technique known as 'transference' don't you...or is it 'projection'???  You are so obsessed with gay sex, I would not be surprised if you and Ted Haggard have a lot to talk about. "
1051,sarc,"what? blasphemy! how dare you insinuate that i, your creator, am not god! that's it buddy, repent!"
1052,sarc,"so the quickest way to get over 20,000 points is to not be serious? check!"
1053,sarc,"oh, i agree with you...oh wait, did a clarify argument show up in the argument listing? damn! i think it did!"
1054,sarc,"1. in ww2 it was already settled that uniform personal were subject to decent treatment. and that's how it has always been. unfortunately, terrorists are not uniformed and do not abide by these rules. if we try and fight them using geneva rules, it's basically like sticking a stake into our heart. soldiers are discharged for firing a gun into the ground in order to intimate a captured enemy combatant. ah, good ol' international law. no one remembers what war is, i guess. 2. you didn't know that terrorists kill innocent women and children? damn."
1055,sarc,"why would you want to go to heaven? to talk to everyone who hates gays? to look down on the people suffering in hell? just for your own personal selfish satisfaction and pleasure from being in heaven, a place of good things, rather than hell, a place or eternal torture and misery? damn."
1056,sarc,"And you have been refuted time after time. Lies, damn lies and statistics is a starting point. Its the false idea of the more powerless you render yourself the safer you will be. I bet you strongly believe its possible to pick up a turd by the clean end. "
1057,sarc,"'Life threatening condition that is always physically harmful""? What a giant load of steamy BS. Rarely is pregnancy physically harmful and even rarer is it life threatening. There are over 6 Billion people on this earth today. If motherhood was so damn dangerous, don't you think the population would be a lot lower, even if it was just due to mothers keeling over after giving birth? Where do you get this BS from, Planned Parenthood? "
1058,sarc,"if it were up to the thought pattern of individuals that produces this, then not only would we be speaking with a british accent because the left can't stomach any war that goes beyoned five years, but you would have left adolph hitler alone too until he invaded poland.  and for the record, the u.n. isn't working on sanctions against iran because they are good and innocent, but because they feel, like i and many others do, that iran is engaging in deceptive and non-cooperative behaviors. and when the darling of the liberal left - the u.n. - feels that way, then maybe there's a lot more to it than you think you know. by the way, how did you like that fatwa for nuclear weapons?"
1059,sarc,"[quote=gansao;461336] darling, you're the b****, i was addressing. a bigamist? doing drugs so early in the day? try to make sense, even if it's a first attempt."
1060,sarc,"hey i just aked a question ....... you think im evil , how would your mum have felt reading half the shit that comes out of your mouth. pfht fuck you darling. oh and i love you."
1061,sarc,"i've noticed a conspiracy or two, people saying that i'm too young to understand what-not. i still prefer my genitalia. i love my genitalia. i would give my lifeblood for my darling sperm - all so that they might have the honor of procuring for me an infant."

1063,sarc,"dear jill: p.s. remember, i gave you the morning after pill? use it! or hey make a few thousand dollars and donate it to research (cha-ching)!! p.s.s. thanks for the herpes! emoticonxgood and you think you have a medical problem, all you have to do is take a pill and you're done with the situation i gave you, but what about the situation you have now given me???  what's that (new) quote: all is fair in love, sex and war? emoticonxkill  jack"
1064,sarc,"oh dear, and your argument against me is not based on what i've said, but what kind of person you perceive me to be. ouch!"
1065,sarc,"attn jessald: so after falling all over yourself in praise of our dear leader, do you realize that nothing he said will curb the rising premiums, deductibles, etc. why can't we have universal healthcare or singlepayer or public options who is gonna control these 'exchanges' --- another corporate industry invention"
1066,sarc,"dear noob, i am officially president of cd, i made a debate where we had an election and i won. i just need to get addltd to make me a banner and things."
1067,sarc,ok i get you he's a redneck oh dear should have known our brand ( ireland ) is slightly different...
1068,sarc,"see simone sweetie that's what i've been talking about. as far as you're concerned liberals are capable of doing absolutely no wrong. even the child raping mayor doesn't get a second look from you. people like you have made left-wing liberals into your religion and you see obama as your veritable messiah. obama could sign an executive order calling for the extermination of 10 million christians, jews and catholics in an effort to wage war on bitter religion clingers and you wouldn't so much as bat an eye at the idea. you really shouldn't so blindly give out your trust to one particular political party dearie. it'll betray you every single time and you'll be too engrained to know what to do. that's why i'm an independent."
1069,sarc,http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releas...-usd072606.php and that which is a press release and is thus in the range of your scholary skills should provide you with some additonal food for thought. unless of course you consider fishes to have limbs rather than fins and unless you think fish have digits like humans etc.
1070,sarc,gee golly that's fantastic! and how might i go about doing that?
1071,sarc,"i probably wasted time creating this debate. everyone knows blacks commit more crime than other races. who in their right mind is going to argue with that? oh wait, aveskde would argue with a sign post if it was crucial to holding his fantastical world-view together, maybe he'll bite. :)  you're projecting. you'll find that few things enrage me or emotionally motivate me."
1072,sarc,"are you really that christian-abused that you have never read the jubelees? have you never read any of the scriptures that are not contained in the bible?  i hate to be the one to inform you, but there are a whole ton of scriptures that were excluded from the biblical compendiumn. try doing your own research and stop expecting others to do it for you.  i didn't 'dream up' the story of jesus tossing his friend off the roof, it's real...look it up! and i hate to remind you, but i'm agnostic. so belief in ghosts and spirits is reserved for physical proof. since ghosts and spirits are non-corporal it's highly doubtful to me that a baby could ever have been concieved without outside help.  man, you guys will believe anything as long as it's written in that ancient book, hun?"
1073,sarc,what the? lmaorolf wow... easy i'm sorry but let me catch my breath... oh man you really are a card... if you couldn't tell my entire post was a joke you dimwitted nut job. always scrounging the bottom of the barrel for anything to use for ammo... did you stuff your brain in the cannon as well before you fired? and fyi i say hun to well almost all my friends as a joke... they know i'm gay but not flaming by any means and they get a kick out of it so lighten up and get the crucifix out of your hand and put it back on the wall alright?
1074,sarc,"i'm a communist and i like pie emoticonxdonno how dare you. i'm almost offended but am so intrigued by your avatar that i get a happy feeling inside and forget about it. but please, next time, please consider the communists when using them as an insult. emoticonxgood *although this post is mostly sarcastic, i am being a little bit serious."
1075,sarc,"what made you think i was responding to you? did i quote you? mention you anywhere?  i'm continually surprised that your inability to reply to any post without personal insults, 'foul' language, and broad generalizations hasn't caught the attention of the admins. of course, if you eliminated that part of your posts and left only the valid contributions and actual facts, there'd be nothing left. emoticonxrolleyes  waxy"
1076,sarc,"as typical you have it wrong. being an atheist shows your a dumb ass. proof of this is that you are in the military. too dumb to think on your own and have to rely on someone else to tell you when to eat and sleep, i'm impressed. it was constitution not constitution. learn the difference. for spending so much time on-line, you haven't learned a thing. probably military intelligence at work."
1077,sarc,"gee, i'm just bowled over by your mature and articulate counterargument.emoticonxrolleyes we all know genitals have nothing to do with sex."
1078,sarc,"only you would consider accepting donations equivalent to charging a fee moose. as if the two are at all similar. after all, one is a mandatory charge, while the other is an optional donation.  and i'm not going to defend the rapture at all, but don't you think it's a bit premature to assume it will never happen?"
1079,sarc,"wow. i'm not really that surprised at something like this happening. most anti-gay bigots i've met seem rather petty, and i wouldn't put it above many of them to attack a person like this. and boy, this really shows these 'christians' sure know how to follow christ's teachings. emoticonxrolleyes"
1080,sarc,i'm not surprised. that's a typical response when someone calls your bluff. waxy
1081,sarc,"you're young and ignorant. sorry you didn't care for the response, but i'm not surprised. you're pretty well brainwashed already."
1082,sarc,"i obfuscated nothing. actually, it's not 'different' at all in that there is nothing in the gay article that is shown wrong or incorrect. so much for your 'obfuscation'... and predictably, absolutely no link from you... what have you got to hide? considering the typical rampant fraud committed when christians attempt a lot of these 'petitions' against civil unions, i'm not surprised there were some recognized as invalid. here is a video on the techniques that were used in massachusetts. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smgua...eature=related"
1083,sarc,"wait so being bullied is infringing on your rights? well no duh but if i 'bucko' have to deal with it on a daily basis just for the fact that i'm slightly different i'm not surprised someone has to deal with it for their sexuality. and if they just dealt with the fact they were gay, accepted it and realized that other people aren't the end all and be all, that they'd eventually find people who accepted them for who they were and that high school wasn't the world maybe they'd still be alive."
1084,sarc,"gary, you think i'm completely wrong? i'm shocked! really i am... somehow i suspect you'd also find a way to say i was completely wrong if i said schools should still use books... and come on, why can't i call you a lunatic? you know i want to."
1085,sarc,"i think you're not understanding me. skin color is genetic. you are saying the skin color represents genes. ...we're arguing for the same thing. i know, i'm shocked."
1086,sarc,"agreed, and they are really grasping at straws now. i'm surprised that anyone still takes kennedy seriously. emoticonxrolleyes"
1087,sarc,"what i appear to have, what we all appear to have, is another case of you not following the thread. of course, pro-gay republicans are few and far between... that was my point.  thanks ever so much for dredging up their website. did you notice that the 'latest news' was from last july? of course, that's better than their 'in the news' area... where nothing past 2001 and 2002 is posted. lol frankly, i'm surprised they bother to update the website at all. they're dead in the water... quite pathetic."
1088,sarc,"i must be blessed to be surrounded by so many posters with a direct line to god so that they know who is saved or in hell. with christians as well-informed as this, i'm surprised god doesn't just retire and let them take over. after all, 6,000 years since creation must be enough for anyone."
1089,sarc,i'm surprised theodore roosevelt hasn't come back to kick some major @$$. how many other presidents to you know that got shot and still delivered their speech before going to the hospital? if andrew jackson were still around he'd literally be beating these anti-gun fanatics over the head with his hickory cane. you don't get much more serious than a president who said one of this greatest regrets was not killing his own vice president when he had the chance.
1090,sarc,"if the federal government wants to pay for it, fine. the federal government has no business telling private insurance companies how to run their business. especially if they have religious ties. i'm surprised anyone wanted to put their dick inside your rotted out pussy."
1091,sarc,"you are brainwashed, actually. i'm surprised you can't see that. i mean really, pretend you are an atheist. if you read what you just wrote, you'd think you're brainwashed too."
1092,sarc,"wow, talk about a hypocrite who tells jito to read what he said, and then directly afterward comes up with something that she didn't say. i can't say i'm that surprised, jp. as to what she was talking about - she was (accurately) describing you as a bigot with hatred toward gays, evidenced by your many statements here, including the one she quoted in which you called her family a deviation."
1093,sarc,"it's just fabulous that unity amongst republicans can disrupt a democratic process for a fair and honest election. republicans have their candidate. mccain is a shoe-in. so now some republicans can turn their focus to disrupting the democrats process. i am amused that the party that espouses 'family values' doesn't include honesty as one of those family values. i have yet to hear of any republican condemning such acts. i guess 'do what you can to ensure a victory' is 'moral' now... and on the flip side, for any democrats voting to disrupt the republican primary process, they are equally repugnant. but at the same time, i haven't heard anybody as high level as 'limbaugh' advocating what he just did. (i don't typically listen to the punditry crowd (with some exceptions), so what i haven't heard may not be a good authority.)"
1094,sarc,"are you talking about this one??? he was talking about 'god'. he never said your 'god'. and i am both amused and bored by the fact that i just explained to you how evolution and a belief in a creator can co-exist, and you completely ignored it. but you're going to continue to claim that they are mutually exclusive, won't you..."
1095,sarc,"seven demons, huh? is that a lot? small chance of clean living with those guys on board, huh? interesting. i am intrigued that you believe in demons. do they still exist? if so, how are they manifest and how would you know that?"
1096,sarc,the ones that make you stupid. you are so passionate about this thing that your judgment is impaired. i am kind surprised that you let your emotions influence your quest for truth. atlas shrugged is as dangerous as the bible and people like you are as bad as religious fundamentalists.
1097,sarc,"'the guy is an idiot' he's a kid cut him some fucking slack, he might not have a suitably refined message, and he may able to correctly articulate his position but im sure he knows why he's there. '.i would suspect if most were interviews they would say the same thing.' why i am not surprised, you obviously wouldn't think for second that maybe the tv went around interviewing lots of people in order to find a flaky guy they could single and use to defame the movement, that thought could never enter your mind? what you think thats not how tv stations work? 'they want people to work for them....support them. they are moochers' the majority of them have jobs, what the fuck are you talking about, your small minded bigoted position is as clear as ever, you would have been a fine nazi."
1098,sarc,"never said anything about a 'lost speech'. but who knows? he may have had his speech writers prepare half a dozen different speeches. the community organizer knows when to push and when to back off. there was enough of a public outcry for him to realize that this was not the time to push. so he backed off and wasted the country's time by re-hashing old wisdoms. i am rather amused about the labels thrown out by you, simon and foundit. just because i had the audacity to criticize the anointed one i am a hysterical racist. keep them coming."
1099,sarc,"uncalled for, my nationality doesn't have much relevance to this, but nah you can go on pretending you're the only country in the world and shoot yourselves to hell, it's about what i'd expect. you see i hear something like the school massacre in europe, i am shocked, but in the usa it's a regular occurrence! but nah, you keep your guns if they make you happy, go play with your boom booms. i know 18 kids who won't have a happy christmas!"
1100,sarc,wow! i am soooooooo amazed by your come back skills... another epic fail!
1101,sarc,i disagree with it because there is no god. these are your words: 'i propose that a standard of good or evil cannot be defined by humans or human constructs.' i guess i shouldnt be surprised that i cant get a straight answer. you dont know. i am surprised your 'god' has not provided you with more adaquate ansures.
1102,sarc,"i am surprised to hear you, a card-carrying christian, defending the civil rights of polygamists! wonders will never cease!  obviously the point flew right past your noggin. gay people are discriminated against because they are gay! but then, you folk think that's just fine. a few years ago, you'd have been blowing hard about 'activist' judges allowing interracial marriage. how dare they stand up for equal rights! emoticonxrolleyes"
1103,sarc,"i am surprised (well not really) that you don't see the simularity. and, we must not forget the elvis believers too"
1104,sarc,seriously though simone. clinton has a record of forcing himself upon women . i am surprised that you have any time for him. bet you like teddy kennedy too!
1105,sarc,"there is no limit to what chuck norris can do. i am surprised he hasn't broken into your house for talking to him like that. but perhaps the kindness in his heart makes him better than that. jesus is a hippy, so i don't see how he could take him on. there is no limit to what jesus christ can do. i am suprised that jesus christ hasn't taken your soul since you compare a god to a mortal. but he still loves you and wants to be in a relationship with him. chuck norris is a mortal, i don't know how he can defeat a god."
1106,sarc,i just love how deliciously ironic this statement here is. well done.
1107,sarc,i love how the apple fan is illiterate. what exactly is the great thing that apple invented?
1108,sarc,i love how point-whoring/farming is allowed when it's in the form of this.
1109,sarc,"i love how you reply without putting any thought into your post, it is awesome. the answer to my question was no. your computer screen is not absorbing light from the sun and reflecting the color yellow back to you. thanks for playing, you lose. we know you don't actually believe in science, so you can stop trying to quote it."
1110,sarc,i love how i am getting under your skin. it really amuses me and your wish is my command.
1111,sarc,i love how scumbarge doesn't give a rebuttal to this. he knows you have him by the balls.
1112,sarc,i love how you managed to make a counter-troll sound like a serious reply :)
1113,sarc,i love it when you bash people for stating opinions and no facts when you turn around and the same thing...i take it you have proof of a lie (keep in mind that lying is not the same as being wrong). as for hagel...i will assume he is actually in iraq right now and wrote that. give me a break emoticonxrolleyes
1114,sarc,"i love it when christians say this...pay who, for what, whose sin? if he is god, no one had to die for anything. he could blink his eyes and everything would be as he wanted!"
1115,sarc,"i love it when people manipulate statistics in order to attempt to prove a causal relationship that doesn't exist. considering the fact that more women vote than men, one could argue that their views are over-represented. "
1116,sarc,"i love it when straight, christian folk who disapprove of gays seem to know so much about what it is to be gay - how it feels, how they became that way, the nature of their relationships and whether or not its something they can control. hey archangel - if you ever need brain surgery i know a fantastic auto mechanic you can talk to. emoticonxrolleyes"
1117,sarc,i love it when the left dogs beck but blatantly shows their bias by not covering news stories detrimental to our pot-earred president. ;)
1118,sarc,"i love when people say 'personal property' of the mother....since when is a life personal property? oh, my mistake, slaves were."
1119,sarc,lol i love when people open their mouths and don't read the thread. i'm pro-choice btw i have no problem with anarchy. also i'm not the one arguing for twiller's death. i said its understandable not that i condone it. you can understand why someone did it while not condoning their actions. seriously read the thread before you open your mouth less embarrassment and looking like a preaching crone that way.  frankly i'm all for abortion if not to keep idiocy out of the gene pool. @cun: depends on how soon the egg was going to hatch. if it was due to hatch in a day yeah i consider you having killed a chick.
1120,sarc,i love when random myth followers talk about critical thinking :d
1121,sarc,"wow, lets all clap for that great argument for evolutionism. personally, i'm not sure why this is being brought up again."
1122,sarc,"oh really, a combination of the words expel and arm mean to expel arms? wow, she was a creative genius! i think what he meant was rowling just takes all the stereotypical magicy stuff and mashes it all together into a tacky and overused paste."
1123,sarc,"oh really, you've been dead before? what's that like? should i dress warm for heaven or is it kind of chilly up there in the clouds?"
1124,sarc,oh really? then why don't we go naked and live in a forest or jungle? ................ i did not mean to say that i say we are different but the same.
1125,sarc,"why do they have to accept this? why doesnt the government just find a solution that satisfies both parties? oh right, because that would eliminate this great topic at election time."
1126,sarc,"accountable by trial? by following the advice given to them? how about holding the advisors accountable? oh wait!! how about holding the people who put the advisors in power accountable? oh shit!!! hold the government accountable! hold the people who put government accountable. hold every citizen accountable. nice work, captain hindsight. you put yourself at trial. 'i shouldn't have acted like i know more about drilling for oil than oil companies'."
1127,sarc,"yes, and you are playing white knight for gays everywhere. i wonder which is more annoying? oh wait. i already know."
1128,sarc,bambam you're parents are on dope! they probably help the mexicans bring that shit into the country. who names a kid barack and who's last name is obama? messed up parents... oh wait he never really did have parents cause he had 2 mothers and 2 fathers!
1129,sarc,"the amount of people that kill their wife/husband/boss/friend/randomer out of a sudden bout of rage is considerably high. and besides, even if we save one persons life, that's good?? oh wait no, all you industrialists care nothing of the little man, your own necessities are more important.  and what sort of an arsehole says ' some people have to die..' can't you just put them in jail?? who are you to decide who has the right to die or not? how can i argue with someone who says 'killing is bad, unless you kill bad people'. oh wait, you never said killing was bad."

That may be because I just don't understand what you are writing.I thought you were arguing that there is no right of same-sex couples to marry but that they should be allowed to marry anyway.

Adult heterosexual consenting non-related parents whose procreation is almost guaranteed to cause genetic defects? We leave it to them to decide and choose the preventive measures. Related?

186,notsarc,"How the heck does darwinism get one out of poverty????I think you are generalizing by lumping ALL education into the specific areas that some religious conservatives oppose. If they opposed getting degrees, going to grad school, etc., I could see your point. But I don't know of any religious sect that opposes that."
187,notsarc,"What's that supposed to mean? A fetus is a general term for the age of an eight week old baby. Though personally, I suspect it is used by many pro-abortionists as a way to avoid saying outright that abortion is the killing of a baby. Obviously since killing a baby is against the law, they've tried to twist it around to soothe their own consciences."
188,notsarc,"Common sense? A collection of human cells as yet not developed enough to have even the potential for consciousness a human being? Uncommon sense IMO. Just the use of the term ""unborn"" is ridiculous. Are the rest of us the ""undead""?"
189,notsarc,"Making up numbers again georged? Care to post some links to this data?In 2005 Israel received 2.5 billion, most of it being foreign military financing...there is some more they get though so your 5 billion might be right. As for the 28 billion in 2002...I know that is wrong. I recall a 200 million dollar thing, but I don't know if it went through.The rest of your numbers are probably overstated as well....you have a bad habit of doing so."
190,notsarc,"Again, would you please show how this limits anyone's speech in any way? This is just paper work that lobbyists need to fill out, it's not infringing on any rights in any way. You are totally free to buy people to push your agenda, you just need to document that that is what you're doing."
191,notsarc,"It was not an 'attack'. He was replying in to my post about the IRA and most of his post was about the IRA too. There was one sentence at the end to which you were replying to.Since you captured the entire post, I thought you were addressing the IRA issue which was the main part of the post. How would I know you were adressing the last sentence ? But when you only captured the last sentence in your quote when you answered me, I could seen what you were replying to. If you had done that at first, there would have been no misunderstanding."
192,notsarc,"However, so much of the sex, in fact, most of the sex that happens, gay or straight, does not lead to reproduction. Why is there not the same aversion to oral sex, masturbation, condoms, dating, etc.? No one is saying people who do those things should have fewer rights, be excluded, or should not be equal, provided those people are not gay."
193,notsarc,"But is the gun that you keep in your home a greater risk to yourself or to a potential intruder? It's pretty easy to find information on the FBI and the CDC websites that shows that more people die in gun accidents than criminals die in legally justifiable self defense shootings. People defending guns often only look at the gross benefit of gun ownership, not the net benefit when it comes to safety. That would make about as much sense as only looking at your gross income while ignoring the fact that your net income is negative."
194,notsarc,"'Most Biblical scholars'? If you mean they think the letters are forgeries and weren't at least dictated by Paul, then it's just not true that most Biblical scholars think that. I agree in terms of the idea that Paul in some cases had someone else actually put the words on paper and he told them what to write, but that's pretty irrelevant here, IMO."
195,notsarc,"I don't argue mine is blind faith. You don't seem to argue opposite other than to say ""no I don't"". For example, you say you don't want to kill others because you don't want to be killed. Well why don't you want to be killed? What is the rational reason behind that? Not only that, how do you get from no wanting to be killed to not killing. Their is not set of reason that draws that conclusion. "
196,notsarc,"If I want ""people"" to think? Kronos, the only one here who's making a big issue of whether or not I state the obvious here is you. You're the one making a big deal of it here. In a case where it's blatantly obvious, as in this one, then obviously there's an issue of homophobia here."
197,notsarc,"What issues? You drivel on about breasts forming on lizards (even though the most primitive milk secretors we have today don't have anatomically distinct mammary glands, and the earliest mammals evolved from reptiles not remotely like lizards), then triumphantly crown your straw man with what you seem to think is a knock-down point about nerve connections.Yes, SS, the most primitive milk-secreting structures we know are modified sweat glands; your incredulity does not alter that fact one iota. And guess what? Sweat glands have nerve connections to the hypothalamus..."
198,notsarc,"Interesting links. Thanks for posting them. I had also previously heard of a number of experiments showing altruism in animals. It helps show that altruism has a biological and evolutionary basis.I am curious, though, what made you think that scientists (materialists, etc.) think that altruism is limited to humans? Please explain how you came to this conclusion."
199,notsarc,"As in we, do you mean we the USA or we, the World ? Because this is a World wide issue and not something the US can solve on its own in any case."
200,notsarc,"Yeah let's, and can you prove that all of those kids were out and known gays by their community rather than suffering alone because they didn't accept themselves for the feelings they were having ? Or that they were more afraid of telling and disappointing their parents ? It is so easy to blame gay bashing without even considering that natural social pressures of everyday life tells us all that being straight is the norm even if PC dogma is now pushing the normality of being gay.The reality is that all of those social pressures mean very little to a young teen who doesn't want to be different from the rest of his friends under any circumstances. Do your statistics clarify those internal issues that motivated those kids to commit suicide ? That would be a neat trick since the kids are dead."
201,notsarc,"It's probably defensive to some extent on both sides. A lot of atheists I've run into seem to be out to prostlytize as well--they are basically evangelists for the atheist way of thinking. Religiously atheist, you might say. They're looking for opportunities to assert the atheist message. And I've read some pretty darn hateful things said about Christianity right here in these forums, and just chalking it up to be ""defending"" or ""kicking back"" doesn't really fly. Who knows who threw the first punch? It's to the point that it doesn't really matter anymore, because both sides should be showing respect."
202,notsarc,"Still dodging the question, I see. I guess you guys are just uncomfortable with it.What is the rational basis for discriminating against gay couples while offering partnership benefits to straight ones? What is it straight couples have that gay couples do not, except for opposite sexual organs? And why is this a ""rational"" basis for discrimination.Sorry, but the argument that ""the majority demand it"" is not a ""rational"" basis; it's a tyrannical one. If the majority demanded free lollipops and zero taxation, would that be a rational basis for a legislature acceding to the demand? I suspect even a right-wing populist might baulk at that one."
203,notsarc,We are on due process now? How can you evolve how you deal with due process? Due process simply means that processes which are required by law. The court evolved this into substantive due process which is changing the meaning of the constitution. Do you deny substantive due process?
204,notsarc,What good has come from religion? None that I can see.
205,notsarc,"Galatians 6:7 Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.The whole concept of ""reap what you sow"" is a CHRISTIAN concept.And now you're claiming it's flawed?While I feel the need to continually reiterate that what this guy did in harming others was WRONG (primarily to avoid the trolls from misrepresenting my point), the validity of the generic concept of ""reap what you sow"" is amazingly poignant.People typically don't just go nuts and harm people for no reason.Columbine saw the kids trying to harm other kids who harassed them.While some people may be jumping the gun in trying to assign ""sowing"", I am also amazed that others are so unwilling to inspect the question of whether or not the church involved truly did ""sow""..."
206,notsarc,"I do appreciate your point while I disagree on principle. I guess it boils down to the fact that even if I believed in a God I couldn't accept that He would command us to suppress our true innate nature. Why would He makes us that way and then expect such a thing? Christians especially are indoctrinated from early on with the notion that that is exactly what God commands. To suppress a good many natural inclinations. To accept that we are sinful by nature and need to be punished, our nature brought to heel."
207,notsarc,"lesz, debating our disagreements respectfully doesn't in any way mean I intend to compromise my beliefs or my values by now accepting that which I believe to be harmful and wrong, morally speaking. Do I have to quote the numerous other posts on this thread of mine that have stayed on point without any condemnation at all for you to get my point that this hasn't been a thread of condemnation, flaming or gay bashing by anyone on my side of this debate? Especially by jyoshu who started the thread.It boggles my mind that you have taken such offense at this thread considering the importance of it for all of us since this strain is out there and is so difficult to treat."
208,notsarc,"That's a completely different issue jo. If those pro gay sites were accurately translating and interpreting the bible as it intended itself to be translated, I would accept it with open arms. But how can I accept the lies that homosexual apologists attempt to tell by distorting Gods truth in order to justify their sin? You should understand that I can't allow that rather than you using those corrupted sources in order to support what you personally want the bible to say. I welcome anyone to take the content of the links that tell each story within my link above, and disregard the info if any opposing info is found regarding the claims they make. But just attacking it because it's a jewish source is ridiculous."
209,notsarc,Why do you oppose gay marriage? The traditional definition of marriage is as a contract for the purchase of a bride. The wedding is what is sacred. What you are doing is no different than those who opposed marriage betwen people of different races or beliefs as well. You have no valid reason to oppose it either.
210,notsarc,"You two are on the same side, you just don't know it yet. And you're both friends of mine so shake hands and make up willya? emoticonXHohoemoticonXGoodAnd yes's video IS very disturbing because it shows that in a time of natural catastrophe's or mass turmoil, our Government will confiscate guns from law abiding citizens. During the LA riots after the Rodney King verdict, the Gov't ordered all gun shops to lock down and to stop selling ammunition. So even law abiding citizens with legally registered weapons couldn't buy ammo to protect themselves."
211,notsarc,"YOU LIAR.You are distorting the truth the same way Moore did. The truth is the NRA event was planned 1 year before the killings in Littleton. The truth is the NRA rally was canceled excpet for the officers meetings which is required by LAW to NOT BE CANCELED. HESTON said ""FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS"" in North Carolina 1 year later.And what transcript are you talking about? The transcript is posted above. What big pro-gun rally are you talking about in Denver. Do you mean the one that NEVER happened?"
212,notsarc,That just sounds alarmist to me. Do you realize the actual implications of taking away second amendment rights? It is just not going to happen.
213,notsarc,"Your writing is as muddled as your thinking.I assume the ""they"" here is the IPCC? Are you seriously asking why radiative forcing (which can be accurately calculated using line-by-line radiative transfer codes, see Collins et al. 2006 and Myhre et al. 2001) is relevant to the issue of global warming?"
214,notsarc,"Well for one thing religion is specificly mentioned in the constitution, not as 100% protected but in that gov't cannot mandate a religion. Also, religion is not unilateraly protected, as I've stated several times. There are many restrictions put on religion by government and if government can restrict religion then why not which marriages they recognise? That being said I have long been a supporter of limited gov't and believe that gov't has no business endorsing or giving advantages to any marriage. They should be silent on the subject."
215,notsarc,"Don't be so faithful in our laws. Remember prohibition? Of course, I myself highly doubt that Obama will manage to ban firearms, but mark my words, he will do anything in his power to restrict them."

217,notsarc,"I don't believe that Orthodox doctrine deals directly with WWII. I am unfamiliar with such. Are you saying that the event you stated had a direct bearing on the cause of the war?Our doctrine would deal with evil, in general. But there may be Orthodox writers who have commented on the war. We are a Church with doctrine, but it would take more than a number of writers commenting on something to make it a 'doctrine'.Armenia was the first nation on earth to adopt Christianity."
218,notsarc,"Hahaha  yes , bashing Reagan, Bush, and just about every high profile conservative out there is a really good way to prove it. Youve reinforced your proof with almost complete lack of confrontation with far left posters here, like Simone, Chester, and countless others. All your disdain of talk radio and Fox news helps a lot too. A book could be filled with all of your put-downs of Bush, have you said anything bad at all about Obama yet? Unlike past years, nothing I see at this place surprises me anymore."
219,notsarc,"Quite frankly, that makes absolutely no sense.So conservatives in the blue states will buy more porn because why? Cause they are in a blue state?And liberals in the red states will buy more porn because why? Cause they arein a red state?Your excuses lack any cogent theory behind the scenario.In science, when people put forth a hypothesis they provide a basis for their claim as to the mechanics of the phenomenon.But with you, you just throw out different ideas with no basis."
220,notsarc,So it's not like they are just pocketing insane profits they actualy are using the profits to improve the drugs they have and R&D. Just a note wouldn't the modifications still be considered R&D? I'm not doubting you it is just my take. I'm assuming that alot of testing and research would still have to be done in the mods & that the 5% would be on the lines of new research.
221,notsarc,What kind of quality? How about speed?Free but slow and crappy healthcare is not acceptable and I'd vote a solid no.

223,notsarc,"Hah!Now how about your specific criteria for documenting the supernatural? And if you don't have it, then don't ask. And tell Brigid not to bother whining about it anymore either."
224,notsarc,"You failed to answer a question. Have you had an abortion? I'm not arguing against abortion or for it, I'm arguing against your faulty premise that the abortion debate can't be related to slavery. Cite your source on that APA study. Because I found multiple sources that say while some women feel relieved, others have emotional problems. I would like to know whether these women had early or late-term abortions. Either way, I doubt the majority is relieved."
225,notsarc,"The same could be said of Clinton.Tell me. How do people learn if you insist on covering up these situations?If a person like Sanford isn't exposed to his own medicine, how will he (or others) not recognize how it tastes?Furthermore, I find your perspective a little baffling.What he said ""many years ago""? Is that something he should be embarrassed of, because he was wrong?Or should he be embarrassed cause he got caught?Cause the standard of not cheating on your wife is not a bad standard. It's a good standard.We have too many politicians who look out for their own interests, and say things just for political gain not to take it seriously."
226,notsarc,"Exactly my point. And do you know why evolutionists love to use fruit flies as subjects in experiments like these? it's because their lifespan is so incredibly short, around 2 weeks long, so many generations can be observed in a shorter amount of time making the probability of observing an actual change more likely. But as we saw with Iangb's e coli experiment, even 40,000+ generations of e coli wasn't enough for it to evolve into anything other than another strain of e coli. emoticonXGoodLife Cycle of the Fruit Fly"
227,notsarc,"yes it is...you said.. """"""""""They should keep it to themselves, if they believe homosexuality is ""deviant"".

229,notsarc,"In private homes? No. Smoke detector and a fire blanket are fairly common. Standard practice in a fire in a private home is get everyone out, closing doors behind you and let the fire brigade deal with it. We pay part of our council tax to train professionals, it's safer all round if they're allowed to get on with their job. Plus almost all our housing is brick or stonework, so holds up longer in a fire and can be repaired more easily.The police don't carry guns because they don't need them, and the consequences of accidents and screw-ups are much greater when you've shot someone in the chest as opposed to hitting them with a baton or CS spray. There is a big difference between a life jacket or seatbelt where the only function is lifesaving, and a gun which is intended to kill."
230,notsarc,Did he say it should only be lowered for gay relationships? Probably not. Are there straight people who would advocate for changing the age of consent? Yes. There are different arguments for and against lowering the age of consent which have nothing to do with gay equality rights.
231,notsarc,"so God would rather have evil in the world than infringe freedom. how very libertarian of you, jyoshu.but actually, are evil and freedom inversely proportionate? look at the examples i gave: slavery is both evil and an infringement on human freedom. on top of that, God puts evil into people and then does not take responsibility when these people do evil things... not to mention the evil that he himself has done. murder, genocide, bigotry... the lot.if he made people with complete freedom, he MUST have made people with evil as well. why did he do that? the only reason i can come up with is that if God made everyone in his image, he himself must be evil, even partially. that that is apparent in the bible."
232,notsarc,What is the point of this comment? I consistently see it brought up by people of a certain political persuasion. How is this a slam against Obama? Can anyone name a recent president who didn't regularily use a teleprompter? And yet somehow the fact that Obama uses one is a sign of his ineptitude? How?
233,notsarc,"Inconsistent how? If you give me specific quotes of mine that were inconsistent, I will be more able to respond. I never said I didn't know. I said there is no empirical evidence. That is not synonymous with not knowing. The word ""proof"" as I am using it is subjective. What if proof enough for me is not for you. What is proof for me is not empirical. According to my definition, I have proof. It's just not proof that you will accept. It comes down to a simple difference of epistemology. I believe that personal metaphysical evidences can be accepted, you don't. End of story."
234,notsarc,Once again you reveal a cruel God who creates people then puts a tree there and tells them not to touch it. Why put the tree there in the first place? If you have children you do not put candy in front of them then tell them not to touch without explaining to the consequences that they can not understand. You put the candy up and out of sight.
235,notsarc,"Clear up some more muddled thinking for jo. As stated, that is from the Declaration of Independence. When was it penned?The Constitution would not have been ratified without the BOR being included. When were those rights penned and when was it adopted? The Declaration simply told England why we were separating and why, it had nothing to do with the BOR."
236,notsarc,"Ever been to eastern KY? Many of the residents share a very strong faith in the christian religion. They also share abject poverty, malnutrition and starvation, substandard or absent medical care, contaminated water supplies, and dangerous and often poorly heated / ventilated ""housing"". Yes Easy, truly their cups overfloweth."
237,notsarc,"What is conveniently missing from your response? An explanation of why a limit on the number of guns that can be purchased during a certain time period is not a law which imposes ""conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms"" per Heller. If the punishment does not fit the crime it does not necessarily follow that the crime is Constitutionally protected. Executing someone for shoplifting would be unjustifiable. However, that does not mean that there is a Constitutional right to shoplift."
238,notsarc,like most things in christianity as the catholic church got organized. http://kevinantoine.com/holytrinity.htm now why does that matter? the burden of proof is yours to prove that god exists and the bible is his communication to man. you have made absolutely no progress towards that end. do not think my speculation on the evolution of the internal inconsistencies of christianity in any way substitutes for that responsibility.
239,notsarc,"prosecutors of every party under pressure to keep their conviction rate up? it's not an unreasonable argument to say it's better to make sure the criminal is put away than gamble on the risks in a trial of intimidated witnesses, forensic screw-ups etc. it's also not unreasonable to suggest that the harm done by making child abuse or rape victims give evidence in court outweigh that done by a small reduction in setence for the perpetrator."
240,notsarc,"you're using scale as a limiting factor in this argument - are you not? you accept that small changes can change a genome, but you don't allow the small changes to accumulate into a large change. instead, you insist that large changes must happen suddenly.  distinguishing between micro and macro evolution, accepting one and denying the other, is like distinguishing between micro and macro erosion, claiming that sure, and inch or two can erode off that mountain, but the whole mountain? something else is behind this mountainous disappearance because erosion just doesn't explain it."
241,notsarc,"what's wrong with gradualism? is it not statistically inevitable? by blending of traits, do you mean that you can't have active both genes from two parents? it seems like there would be exceptions to this. also, traits are rarely controlled by a single gene. would this not mean a trait could be derived from both maternal and paternal genes?"
242,notsarc,nato are you serious!? please don't tell me you are buying this too!?!?!?! you can repeal any amendment! by repealing the 2nd amendment you could enact whatever gun law you wanted. even the american spectator talks about that. i'm hoping i just misunderstand you. the american spectator : repeal the second amendment?

244,notsarc,"that's a real laugh, coming from someone with so little knowledge of the legal and justice systems as you. do you even know what goes into obtaining a search warrant? do you know what the limitations are regarding the scope of a search warrant and how it has to be narrowly tailored to something specific and nothing else? right. and it was ca law that lead to a father's children being murdered because he thought he was obligated to keep his guns locked up at all time, making them inaccessible even in a true life or death emergency. it was also california law that proved just how registration can, does and will, lead to confiscation. they proved our case for us and showed everyone that we weren't paranoid, and instead knew exactly what we were talking about."
245,notsarc,"i don't think much can be inferred about the relationship between guns and crime by comparing the crime rate of a densely populated city with the crime rate of a whole state. virginia has a higher homicide rate that most canadian provinces which is probably a better comparison-  homicide offences, number and rate, by province and territory is it possible to make it much harder for criminals to obtain guns? yes, i think so. if your boat is sinking then you have to plug all the leaks not just some of them. if you keep plugging the leaks then eventually you'll reach a state in which significantly fewer criminals are obtaining guns. why do i say this? because significantly fewer criminals are obtaining guns in developed countries with stricter and more consistent gun laws. in the us, there is too much inconsistency in gun laws."
246,notsarc,"it is silly to focus on the tools and not bad people who misuse these tools, especially when the tools in question can be easily smuggled as well as made in a modestly-equipped machine shop. also, why do many of those who supposedly have a political orientation that favors freedom and opposes tyranny want to severely and arbitrarily limit the rights of tens of millions of people who have not, and show no indication of wanting to, unjustly hurt anyone with these tools?  it is wrong to tell people that they cannot put certain substances in their bodies and have abortions, just as it is wrong to tell people that they cannot have certain precision-machined metal/polymer/wood objects in their own homes."
247,notsarc,"this is absolutely incorrect on your part. an intentional lie? the phrase certainly is there, in the greek. ('   .') you really need to stop making claims about things you just don't know that much about. (http://biblos.com/mark/7-19.htm)"

250,notsarc,"you havent answered my question. if evolution is lacking the hard, observable evidence you say it's lacking, then surely you should have lots to say about atomic theory. however, you dont. why not? unification theory is different - theres no dependency on that theory like there is with chemistry or biology."
251,notsarc,"just how many cases do you want to read that says exactly what i am quoting? i just gave you a taste of things to come...like the right to be left alone. even the 10 year census, all that is required by the xivth amendment i: 1. number of people who live there 2. sex of each 3. age of each that completes the enumeration and registration for the census. i will ask the 3rd time before i cover you up with cases, show me the enumerated power of any branch of government to require a person to register any right, much less firearms."
252,notsarc,"well, that's really the issue, isn't it? saying that one believes in a deity or admires the moral teachings of jesus is not the same as being a christian. such belief and admiration is quite compatible with rejecting organized christianity in particular and organized religion in general, at both the personal and political levels. and many of the founding fathers, including the more famous among them like franklin and jefferson and washington, clearly rejected organized religion in this way. it is either wilful ignorance or flagrant dishonesty to claim otherwise."
253,notsarc,where are the big gay movements in zimbabwe? where were the big gay movements in 16th spain. there has been cases of brothers and sisters meeting after being apart and having sexual relationships..they cant even have legal sex never mind marry. when homosexuality was made legal in the uk there was no gay couples fighting to marry. they would have been ridiculed or worse . show me cases of pre ww2 gays campaigning for the right to marry in texas . its not likely is it? not in the uk..we have no written constitution( you may be surprised but the usa is only a relatively small part of the world). it was proposed to parliament by a prominent politician ( roy jenkins i think) and the law was repealed. that doesnt really matter it was judged by both the states and the uk to be unfair by mostly straight politicians
254,notsarc,if easyrider is so concerned about pedophilia (which he isn't he's just using it as a lame excuse to scapegoat homosexuals) why then doesn't he speak out again the catholic church and the cover up their doing on their sex scandals? you know who actively does care about the well being of these children? atheists. atheists like richard dawkins. wheres your slippery slope on morality now easy?
255,notsarc,"then why is it that closeted homosexuals that are completely unknown to be gay commit suicide at such a high rate? they aren't persecuted or harassed at all since no one knows they are even having these feeling? it is self loathing that feeds their desire to harm themselves. people who know that what they are is right and good, don't harm themselves at all, but defend and support who they are even when persecuted by others. that's how it was for me when i converted from islam to christianity. all of the persecution i received just made me stronger."
256,notsarc,"obama said no such thing. who said i don't blame loughner? he will be dealt with by the judicial system. but we must take responsibility as a society for the violence that occurs within our communities. he was encouraged, he was incited, he was instigated. do you think that hitler, with his rhetoric, did not bear any responsibility for the night of broken glass?"
257,notsarc,"so?? it was still a speech made for the purpose of political support of gay marriage. yes, i watched it. agreed. it was for the purpose of appealing to emotion (to a political end). no, but my point is that neither does the sanitized 'norman rockwell' image that some gay-pride proponents want projected by linking to videos such as the one here. it might give the impression that gay pride is merely some 'family-friendly' movement without the reality of the very dark side to it."

260,notsarc,"i see some names that don't seem to fit. c.s. lewis was a writer and scholar, you want to include tolkien too? aristotle was a prolific thinker but hardly conservative. it is as if you are trying to graft liberal (proper use of the word) philosophy on to traditionalism. you have rand, do you mean rand paul or ayn rand? quotes about the size of government from conservatives and founder types... it is the size of government that matters, not necessarily how it is financed. - dan mitchell senior fellow in political economy, the heritage foundation my reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government. - jefferson government, even in its best state, is but a necessary evil; in its worst state, an intolerable one. - thomas paine  what do you have to say about the 'proper' size of government?"
261,notsarc,"it is significant but if you would read my post again you will see i said no moral significance. since we have been through this before i trust you remember that i am an objectivist and don't believe morality is defined by how many people believe what anymore than scientific facts are or more than 'how could so many people be wrong' is good argument for religion. where is it written? oh and that is not my definition of morality, that is the sickly delusion of subjectivism. few things are more based on reality than morality. you are saying he literally wants no one to acknowledge homosexual relationships? that seems hard to believe given what he's said. and morality as well i assure you."
262,notsarc,".  did i say anything about your family? i don't want to know you and you are doing my job easier by your ad homs. my job is to hold the mirror up to nature and make you look as bad as you are :) have you seen your militia lately? united states code: title 10,311. militia: composition and classes | lii / legal information institute are you doing your militia duty? the law of the land is that the militia is you...and me and every true citizen. that is pro government in this republic. since when did it become invalid? serving as a group is not a necessity to own firearms as the supreme court ruled in mcdonald ruled it is a personal and fundamental right. you really are out of your league aren't you pot licker? emoticonxclown"
263,notsarc,"it's not a state's issue from a gay rights perspective, if the supreme court of the us rules that discrimination of same-sex couples is illegal in marriage, as it did for inter-racial couples. what would this proposed new contract that resembles marriage, be called? we already have such a contract. there's no need to totally re-invent the wheel at this particular time. foundit is correct. it's telling that this issue only comes up when people are looking for a way to not recognize gay couples in marriage."
264,notsarc,"it says that god is not of man so does not lie...it does not state that god is incapable of lying. i would say that the hebrews verse does not say that god is incapable of lying either but you are correct it does say that it is impossible for god to lie meaning there is no possibilty ..not that he is incapable....cant lie ? no it does not say that. a promise is a promise , not a declaration of incapability. god would obviously be capable of breaking that promise and is bound by the oath not incapablility. saying that god cannot die you are applying a limitation to a concept that you do not understand yourself. death does not apply to god.god cannot make infinite plus one ounce either...which is about as ridiculous a statement. death does not mean cease to exist"
265,notsarc,"if his experience is thus, you'd prefer him to impose his own gag order? that certainly doesn't seem right. his experience is quite on par with other ex-gays i've read. it's pretty consistent. i know you don't like his experiences because it doesn't fit your political agenda, but he shouldn't be discouraged from sharing them anymore than you."
266,notsarc,"scientists found out that brains that think differently also work differently? wow... i consider humans biological machines (with experience being the 'software'), so of course brains will be different. but i do not really agree with the 'conclusions' drawn. with the 'traits' shown."
267,notsarc,"i would call you a mid-size business if your payroll alone tops $500,000 a quarter... anyway, corporations do pass savings on. why do stores like wal-mart continue to be able to operate? they keep driving their prices down... and while americans complain about job losses they just love those low prices. yes, they do have much higher margins on their production, but they do pass some low production costs along...it would be far more expensive if they produced the goods in the us, would it not? certainly..."
268,notsarc,a ban on open carry? i have a concealed carry permit and think that giving citizens the right to conceal carry makes sense. but open carry? why? to freak other people out? i'm sure there is good constitutional arguments that can be made but not looking at this from a legal standpoint and instead from a social standpoint i don't understand the logic behind it.
269,notsarc,"are they the ones going to nigeria and whose result of preachings there end up with gays getting killed? the funny thing is that in another thread, i challenged you for evidence that christians rebuke fred phelps... and here, it's obvious that you're punting on the issue of the christian involvement on the issue, providing an excellent example of you being guilty of what you tried to accuse gays of doing. emoticonxmad the irony of that statement is rather underwhelming. if the situation had been turned around between gays and christians, you would be beating this drum like a red-headed step child. emoticonxrolleyes"
270,notsarc,"religion is nothing but a choice but is constitutionally protected. why? blacks and homosexuals are two different classes, unless you are a black gay. it is the way each class is treated that is the same. coservative christians view gay people in the same way as the white supremacists view black people. the more religion attacks gay people and our civil rights the more i am begining to believe that the romans had the right idea to rid the world of such filth."
271,notsarc,how? which does not change the fact that government theft is not.
272,notsarc,"did she say that she needed it? or did she say: 'without insurance coverage, contraception, as you know, can cost a woman over $3,000 during law school,' she said. 'for a lot of students who, like me, are on public interest scholarships, that's practically an entire summer's salary.' do you even know if fluke is sexually active? no, you don't...and frankly it's none of your business. she is advocating for women, not begging for a personal handout. whether you agree with her or not, you have no basis to call her a slut or any other slur you can come up with.  law student makes case for contraceptive coverage : shots - health blog : npr to regulate menstrual cycles? to control ovarian cysts? perhaps to do all 3?"
273,notsarc,"you know simone, the reasons you give are exactly why, assuming no adverse health issues i'm unaware of, the pill should be otc. why shouldn't a woman be able to pick up a little card like they have for sudafed and get a pack of pills? at $.20 to manufacture you'd probably get a pack for $8-9 a month. at that point the insurance is not necessary and you have lower costs for women (insurance is known to increase cost of medicine).  that's the real solution."
274,notsarc,why are these murders 'blatant racist killlings'? the article you posted makes it sound like a robbery gone bad.
275,notsarc,"'two other sacramento-area police officers also were implicated in illegal weapons sales but not charged because they didn't turn large profits,' ah it's ok to sell illegal weapons as long as you don't make a big profit?  'california law bars citizens from buying handguns that have not been deemed safe by the state department of justice, but the law exempts peace officers.' the cops there are above the law? had to put a new hard drive and install,good to be back."
276,notsarc,"bin laden said on that tape that muslims should support iraq. why? iraq is secular. he shouldn't want iraq to be supported... he hates non-muslims. hmm... thistown, who cares what people think? it's a bad idea to set foreign policy by opinion polls. 85% of our population was opposed to entering ww ii before pearl harbor while hitler was killing millions, and we knew all about it. that was the wrong thing to do.  i bet the chancellor is relaxing with a cool glass of french wine waiting for his term to end...his people hate him. he's holding his stance to gain popularity, playing politics. our president blew him off, he's killed relations, and he knows it."
277,notsarc,"a cop tried that in school and got sued and lost, a private individual will get sued for assault, and false imprisonment at the least. there are more cases each day but one thing the justices did mention was marbury v madison. you can ignore an illegal law with impunity. we have the ruling. we also have past cases quoted in the h eller and mcdonald cases. you implied there were none and that is false. would you like to take a stab at nunn v, state of georgia for instance? star gazer cited a lower court ruling that the gun grabbers used just as sinjin used an earlier, oveturned case in people v zirillo. how can you miss so much?"
278,notsarc,"nice twist. do you ever think or read what you write? i know a lot who are in jail, are they still 'agents of the government'?  when they get paid by the dod and work for the fed, we will call them soldiers. know any ex=soldiers? oath remains but that is about it. how about an ex-wife?  this lady we are talking about was not a police officer. know how you keep your status as an police officer?"
279,notsarc,"i'm not playing word games. you said congress doesn't have the power to declare war; how else am i supposed to read that? you meant congress doesn't run the war...you clarified, end of story."
280,notsarc,"how can god be there before time? you can't get before time, as the concept of before is irrelevant without time. even at the very beginnings of the universe time was not one of the curled up spatial dimensions."
281,notsarc,"jake, sorry but your arguments are not very well thought out. marrying interacially is racial but still heterosexual. marry same gender is homosexual. do you see the difference? they aren't saying marrying white woman is bad they're saying marrying a white woman is bad if you're black. gay marriages. they aren't saying marrying same sex is okay but worng if you're gay. they're saying same sex bad straight or gay. do you see the difference?"
282,notsarc,"mike, you seem to imply that the story in genesis is false (whether intentionally or not), yet you accept the rest of the bible as true in its entirety? what about the flood, the plagues, the exodus on a whole? what about the other miraculous and unscientifically supernatural phenomenon that the bible describes? do you believe that these events took place at all? the bible does not only oppose science's theories of universal origin, it also opposes a huge amount of natural laws of physics. would you say that the bible is true and the events in it really occured?"
283,notsarc,"do you really think that there is no difference between bush and kerry? i am actually a fan of the run-off system used by france. many people run, and then the top two candidates participate in a run-off at a later date (unless the top one already has a majority, in which case they are declared elected.) however, in the absence of such a system, i think that the two-party system is best. voters have a choice, but yet there are not so many choices that the winner has little support."
284,notsarc,"so lets ban cars... they kill people... and think all the money could go to public transportation. also we should ban baseball bats as thats the obvious next step in weaponry... don't forget archery... can't have the subjects have any of that... since we are taking away all these weapons to coddle the masses, will the government be disarming too? i see a need for both kinds of weapons as a freeman."
285,notsarc,"actually it is true. as i'm sure that i have stated before, either on this thread or on another thread, vacuum fluctuations must presuppose that there was something to fluctuate - the 'quantum vacuum' is a lot of matter-antimatter potential - not 'nothing'. can you give me an internet site (s) for reference please? on my own admission i don't know much about quantum physics, so any additional information would be really appreciated!  thanking you ahead, matt."
286,notsarc,"economically it is great. heck, it would even be better if robots did all our jobs for us at almost no expense. sure the corporations would be fine with that because they would profit but what about the average person who cannot find a job? sending jobs over seas doesn't hurt our economy but it doesn't help billy who lost his job to it. i'm not suggesting that we stop outsourcing jobs but i am suggesting that while our jobless rate increases that our government do something to keep some jobs here."
287,notsarc,"are you speaking of the federal marriage ammendment to the u.s. constitution? everything i've heard indicates it's a long shot. at any rate, it is just a guess what will or won't happen a few years in the future. i was just pointing out what was happening internationally(mass. is international for me, a canadian)."
288,notsarc,becasue tehre is no merit to the behavior that would need special recognition. should people with attachment disorders be allowed to be polygamists? what is so special about homosexuality that it deserves to be treated different than other behaviors? remember there is no definitve evidence that it is genetic.
289,notsarc,"i am sorry that is just daft, and totally socially unresponsible. what if you marry someone from abroad? government recogniction is required to apply for emigration. what if your spouse was taken severly ill? without government recognized marriage you don't have the right to take time off to care for them. what if you want to adopt? surely marriage needs to be recognized as the best environment for this. what if you marry someone already with a child? it gives you rights over this child. what if your spouse dies before making a will? who is responsible for any ophans? the biological parent even if the kid had been raised their entire life by their step-parent? the list is endless."
290,notsarc,"what time frame are you referencing? back in the time of christ marriage was a practical thing, you needed a wife to bear children, and raise them, and it was not a religious thing. in the middle ages, the nobility would marry in the church. do you think there was no political? did you mean recently, where marriage has become a legal thing?  i am trying to clarify when you are referring to."
291,notsarc,"you guys just don't get it do you? this isn't about an attack on christianity. this isn't about anti-christians, and in the end, this isn't about the cross, or any other religious symbol for that matter, offending anyone. this is about keeping religion from meddling with government, but just as, if not more, important, it is about keeping government from meddling with religion, and the moment they intertwine, there are possibilities for many dangerous things to happen. and by the way, i'm a christian, and i don't want my government in any way defining any part of what i hold dear. p.s. sandycane- most buddhists aren't in india."
292,notsarc,i am a fan! do you think courtney had anything to do with his death?  just curious what other people think about that theory.
293,notsarc,but why can't they be content in another term besides marriage that has all the same benefits as marriage? that's my point.
294,notsarc,"i'd say out of the 6 billion people on earth at least 4 billion of them are richer right now than they would be had the economic systems never changed since the era of globalization began. i don't think the number is as small as 3 people. how doesn't it lead to stability. think china and their reform to capitalism and westernization. are them more of a threat to the world as a communist nation or as a globalized nation? it will be stabilizing to have them westernize. however, it isn't necessarily good. yeah i can see what you mean. the people are just about ready to burst because the us and canada depend so much on each other. nor did i. whew, we agree on something :) isn't that the truth."
295,notsarc,"even with tax deductible status, i seriously doubt there's enough of a market available yet to make privatization a going concern. since all people will ostensibly benefit from whatever flows from the space program, it seems like government is still the only option now. sure, the russians are capitalizing on their experience by taking citizens for rides, but what are they really learning or advancing there? they're getting more and more vocal about us funding their stupid space station. the europeans are primarily interested in the lucrative satellite-launching business; again, where's the hard science? so it seems to fall to the americans -- surprise. but if we don't do it, the chinese certainly will. in all probabilities, they will be fierce competitors, imo."
296,notsarc,"i already understand this quite well, thank you. :) though wasn't jesus christ allegedly alive as a human being on this earth for closer to 33 years? ;) didn't the church also refute the evidence of galileo by its authority? and specifically to which church are you referring? because there are several churches -- including the roman catholic church -- which do not claim to refute the evidence of evolution by their authority. or do none of the other churches count because they are not the one, true church? peace, the bootfitter"
297,notsarc,"did i happen to say that genes had no influence on who you are? no? please read what i said earlier, there's more to you than your enviroment or genes, there's also your personal choices and beliefs."
298,notsarc,"i asked on another thread, but it fits here as well... is there a distinction between the absence of belief in x and the belief in the absence of x? before, i suggested that i couldn't see a distinction, but after pondering it for awhile, i believe there is a distinction between the two: if one asserts that there is no god (or gods), this is a belief in the absence of god. if one makes no assertions one way or another (even internally), then this would be an absence of belief. i'm not certain into which 'side' atheism would fall, though i believe it would have to be the former, and therefore, a belief. the latter sounds more like agnosticism to me. but perhaps someone else can better clarify this topic."
299,notsarc,"i think you are looking at it backwards. there is definatly a side here that should remind of us nazi germany, but it isn't the muslims. when has any muslim claimed they were fighting becasue they hated our culture, our lifestyle or our religion?  they are fighting because they hate our foreign policy. they hate the fact that we support tyrants and dictators all over the world (like in saudi arabia). they hate the fact we send our troops all over the world and meddel on other peoples affairs and force our culture and business models on the rest of the planet.  right now, there are american troops in iraq for the purpose of imposing our political system and social structure on a third party.  i think the question should be, is america the new nazis?"
300,notsarc,"this i do not agree with. i cannot see how the court could rule in favor of doma based on 14th amendment protections. as far as the law goes, the marriage license from couple a from state 1 is the same as the license from couple b from the same state. how could it be constitutional to refuse to recognize the marriage license from couple a, yet recognize the marriage license from couple b from the same state? that is unconstitutional."
301,notsarc,i live in the seattle area and the city boasts there are no differnce in the benefits..........can you cite a link? thanks.......
302,notsarc,"1) i dont recall saying anything that i believed 2) someones experiences should definitly be looked at you are just one rude person. i was just sharing an experience my mom had teaching. not only that, youe are comparing a pedophiliac to a gay man adopting. what does this prove? i never said all striaight families are perfect and i never said all gay families are bad either. all i stated was one persons direct observations on the situation. how many child of gay couples have you taught? observed? 30 years worth? i believe i will take someones experience over you being rude."
303,notsarc,"which state laws are you refering to? as far as i know there is nothing in the us constitution which would require states to perform gay weddings, just to recognizes weddings performed in other states."
304,notsarc,"can you guess why they have these items? i know. do you? it's quite practical for both officers and inmates.  how bout not having a riot in the first place and not having to shoot anyone. if you can prevent it, do it. it causes less pain and suffereing and is less damaging."
305,notsarc,"which you posted. i think it was fair enough for me to take that as you supporting his views. i think both factors had a lot to do with it for us, and by the same token i don't think you can claim that france's decision was purely economic either. i agree. not quite sure i follow. are you saying that france not standing by the us constitutes a crime? i support the war, and think we were correct to do what we thought was right. but by the same token i find it very hypocritical to continually bad mouth the french for doing the same."
306,notsarc,"and as i've already pointed out, this notion that god needs to glorify himself smacks of narcissism on a cosmic scale. why would god in any way need -- or even want -- to demonstrate his glory? he's god: he knows how glorious he is! isn't that enough? and again, as already pointed out, i don't find arbitrary salvation of an undeserving few to be merciful, nor do i find arbitrary damnation of an undeserving many to be just. the calvinist vision of god strikes me as a celestial tyrant."
307,notsarc,"so their support of bush (so you say) means exactly what? that they were listening to the sound bytes dished out by bush's rhetoric? and where is bush is the man and jim's trucking? usually they're all over it when someone says something bad about the american people. oh, that's right... it's ok when a person on the right says it, it's when it said by a liberal like moore that it becomes an issue."
308,notsarc,"yes, and they were also treated very commonly with animal dung, saw dust, and variose other fast-killing medicines. patients were often posioned. egyptians learned all that they had by trial and error. its a known fact. please, even you should know that the hebrews used much, much more advanced technology than that. who were the occultists citing here? besides, this is only the tip of the iceburg of my argument. even if your correct, my argument stands."
309,notsarc,"if this is true, then it's a pity you were absent from mizmaxx's thread 'harry potter is more popular than jesus' thread. how would it 'turn out that he never existed at all'? are you expecting some proof of non-existence? that would depend on the message. if you claimed to be able to levitate, but offered no proofs, then your message would be tied into the source - if you lack credibility, or not. jesus was not just here to provide 'a messge'. he was not a lifestyle guru with a really neat attitude to life. he was the son of god."
310,notsarc,"i don't follow. 'since those of specific faith...' ???? if you don't believe god, then there is no sin. those that do would choose neither of the above over another. of course, there are some here that would, but that's religion for you."
311,notsarc,you actually bring up an interesting point. just how silly is it for people to go on about the 'lies' of an adminastration that obviously risked being un-elected by going to war long before the election season only to find no wmd's. another point to stress is that saddam's threat to the us need not be measured by the size or type of weapons his military possesed. all he would have needed to do was instruct a few terrorist thugs to find a way to attack us. isn't that what the taliban did? no wmd's or for that matter even conventional military weaponry was required for the 9-11 attack.
312,notsarc,"i agree with... well heck, i agree with all of you pro-life people. killing someone in a coma and stabbing somone in the back when they're walking down the street are not any different in 'wrongness.' actually, if we had any pity left in our evil hearts, we would most likely find it harder to kill someone in a coma, because of the fact that they can't protect themselves or think! of course, if we had any pity, abortion wouldn't even be an issue. it is murder. if people can get the death penalty for murdering an grown person that is fully capable of defending themselves (at least, they used to get the death penalty), then why not a child that hasn't even breathed the air of this world yet? in my opinion, abortion should be illegal.  lovethesouth"
313,notsarc,"why? you seem to think you can come here and trash everyone else's religion and go on about how your religion is the 'true' religion and when someone else tries to tell how stupid your argument is, you tell them to stop making fun of it. and why do you care about how old people here are anyway?"
314,notsarc,"i fail to see why that matters. a beating heart does not make the creature a person. if you don't know the details, should you really be forcing your view on other people? since when does the ability to feel pain make something a part of your body? if it is numb is it any less a part of you?  heck, the fetus' brain isn't even developed enough to feel pain until at least the 3rd trimester (according to most scientists). will that make you change your stance on abortion? unlikely.  the fact that the 'unborn child' (makes me think 'undead corpse' whenever i see or type that) is receiving life-giving functions through the unbilical cord means that the creature on the other end gets to decide whether or not she will continue in the life-support function she is in."
315,notsarc,"my implication was that the christians felt they could not compete financialy so they vilified the jews in order to justify destroying them and taking there success. my question is how is that attitude any diffrent from todays ultra liberials that wish to uphold the inheritance tax, or property taxes? todays 'haves' are not nessacerialy all jewish, they are however being attacked by the 'havenots' for their success, much as the jews were back then."
316,notsarc,are you trying to say that people of faith cannot tell the difference between myth and reality? i'm actually confused by this sentence.
317,notsarc,"do you have any evidence of this that doean't come from a biased christian website? so here is where you are saying nanny, nannie, poo,poo my straight realtionship is better than your gay relationship. how? some big claims, can you provide some substance to them, in other words can you back this up with some data? that doesn't come from some christian baised study."
318,notsarc,"to the democratic party? http://slate.msn.com/id/2109218/ problems don't need to be identified, they are either for, or against the party... karl rove has shown us again, at least in his battles, that solutions and understanding take a back seat to ignorance. -mach"
319,notsarc,"if it were only based on religion, you'd have a point. only if your first point were true; and it isn't; and it doesn't include any concern for the philosophies of science and other biases that are being taught as science which scientific method does it mimic? your whole assumption is one version -v- another. this is a false idea of the pelthora of ideas that exist."
320,notsarc,"don't believe what exists montalban? contradictions? you're correct! what does obectivist circular reasoning have to do with your contradictory position? (hint: nothing, it's the latest fallacy of rambling off topic) stuck, no way out...lol, is that in the bible too? or, you could back up your claims and stop avoiding the questions! so that's your definition for non-material is??? montalban defines :non-material it's non-material you're right, that's a non-definition, not a definition. -mach"
321,notsarc,a lot of people are adopted... my science teacher was adopted. he had a successful military career that ended with him as a war planner helping to plan the gulf war... he had a successful chiropratic practice too. what you said is not so true. should he have been denied his life because of some emotional trama he might bave later in life? i don't think so.
322,notsarc,"you're assuming a need to reduce it because government, or a special interest, requests it. if enough people want it reduced, their demands of manufacturers and buying habits will reduce it. deemed by whom? the government, or a special interest? who cares about the species? the majority of individuals, or the government, or a special interest? if the majority doesn't consider them problems, then no solutions are necessary."
323,notsarc,"those religious individuals, namely christians who follow a christ who identified with the poor and oppressed. the jesus christ of empire, which is neither supported by scripture or history, is one of the idols that has been created in service of those who would attempt to drug the masses. to have an encounter with the spirit of christ, is to wake from a long slumber. minus this encounter, i too would be an atheist and subsequently a nihilist. i respect all people who have a sincere desire for truth. but, then what is truth? for the christian truth begins and ends with god as manifested in the person of jesus christ. so, what does that mean? good question."
324,notsarc,"what extended family interference? even mass same-sex marriages can't get ss benefits. you should research joint tenants in common becasue that isn't true that isn't a gaornment decision. that is a business decision. businesses can decide to allow it if they want to, so marriage wouldn't change that. i'm saying what can't you do without it. not about marriages in mass. also the federal government wouldn't recognize it anyways because of defense of marriage act. so far you haven't named one yet. also as couples you don't have that right but individually you have the rights as any citizen.  calling me full of **** while i just showed you have you're wrong.. funny."
325,notsarc,in the old testament people were punished for the sins they committed. i think he's asking why should we punish people while they are living? god will punish them when they die.
326,notsarc,she is an attractive woman. what was she doing witha 14 yr old? she could probably walk into any local club or bar and pick up the man of her choosing.  does she have a specific thing for kids? will she do it again with another kid once this one grows up? if so she is a predetor. of coarse several hundred years ago kids of this age married and fornicated as part of everyday life. is our society that different than is was then?  i was a horn dog when i was 14. or at least wanted to be.
327,notsarc,when did mike moore do that? how about in bowling for columbine when he portrayed chuck heston. here is the scene: 1) cut to heston wearing a dark suit. 2) cut to crying children outside columbine high school. 3) cut to heston saying 'from my cold dead hands.' case in point. both portions of the speech were not in dever nor were they about columbine. i got another quote from mike moore. 'fu** the poor' - mike moore. i put that together after a class in the mike moore school of movie editining 101.
328,notsarc,so snakespit. let me ask you a question? two mike moores? one with a gun and one without? one from musgeon has a gun. the one from flint does not? put both in the same situtation. a criminal jumps over the counter to attack mike moore. which one lives?  which one dies? which one lives unhurt? which one lives with broken facial bones?
329,notsarc,"and how is it a red herring? bearing in mind that forcing one person to harm themselves physically for another is illegal in the us, it's illogical to make this rule apply only to pregnant women. as pregnancy is always harmful, the woman cannot be forced by law to go through it even if you think a zef is a baby."
330,notsarc,"an innocent person can be convicted of a crime--i thought that was what the topic was about. just because they are convicted, doesn't mean they are 100% responsible, guilty, etc for that crime-but if they are convicted then in the eyes of the judicial system--they are guilty. that is why these innocent people are put in prison for 20 years--they are convicted of a crime. i was trying to say that with dna used in forensics, then maybe the dna study blood stain other than the victims might save a person from going to prison on circumstantial evidence. okay, everytime i make a post i get my arse jumped on--what is it with you people? like i said, if the person isn't convicted, then they will not be murdered in the electric chair, or by lethal injection.  comprende' ?"
331,notsarc,"why didn't you think of it? it took me no time at all to find the actual article, who authored it, and how to contact them. from what i have seen of your post, you rarely think at all."
332,notsarc,propaganda?!! dou you make me sick! how can you see these and still make a jeer at these photos. have you know heart for sacrifise of human life? have you no cause? have you no heart!? my heart wrenched when i saw those and it angers me to see one who has been deluded by his own proclamed righteousness to still be better than human decency.
333,notsarc,"okay, my computer is too slow to go search some statistics and copy the url to try and defend my opinion; but, here is my opinion anyway. one reason there are so many crimes against women, or crimes in general, is that offenders are repeat offenders much of the time. how many times have you heard of a child molester being released from prison and repeating the crime? there is not much determent to crime when criminals are put in jail for a year and on their first parole hearing are released back on the street to repeat offenses. i don't know what the answer is --but i think that is the reason there are so many crimes, especially sex crimes."
334,notsarc,"have you been to one? our local catholic schools only require that you take a single religously oriented class and that you attend church twice a week, though they waive the churc requirement witha notef rom your parents. they will even waive the religous class requirement if asked. if you go to a public univerrsity, you are likely to be requred tot ake a comparative religon class, or a sociaology class which includes religous beliefs."
335,notsarc,"when you were asking this question, was it somewhat in reference to bill clinton? personally, i think that whole thing was blown out of proportion. is that the type of thing that you're saying should be investigated?"
336,notsarc,"i meant what i wrote. i was asking if the solution was to continually have sex, or never abstain. but others disagree with you. some say that the life doesn't start until birth. my question is what's wrong with killing? your quiz made it just so it said there wouldn't be a life so abortion is wrong. abstaining from sex does the same thing."
337,notsarc,what about evolution has been observed?  i think it has been more theorized (if thats a word) then anything else. creating theories for theories and so on.
338,notsarc,"so no one thinks we are headed for a collapse of society as we know it? historically, great, well-run and governed empires always collapsed after a time, usually from corruption from within (most likely for us if it happened), or outside conquest. are we the new golden-age? -mach"
339,notsarc,"the question still remains: do they really [change]? control is one thing, change is another."
340,notsarc,"actually i just copied yours. :p i just figured with your past history, you actually did the digging to find the real stuff, unlike many religious people who just preach the same church made up claims. however, hunter has some internal contridictions in his arguments, and does seem to skirt issues when it becomes cumbersome to deal with them.  why do you say that? law is not concerned with preaching love. law is concered with preaching order. singapore is a draconian state, and look how successful they are economically and culturally."
341,notsarc,what religion would that be? atheists are almost all nonreligious and i don't see much buddhism being taught in schools.
342,notsarc,[quote=mae] land that didn't belong to the un or israel. or current american aggression? what's the difference? both are imposing their ideologies by force. you make it sound like choosing a sports team; for or against based on personal opinion.
343,notsarc,"you must be joking. i'm sure that making a gun is quite a bit more complicated than making a paper airplane. then why do nations which ban guns have a much lower gun crime rate than the us? if what you say is true then we would expect to see the same amount of gun crime in nations which ban guns as in the us, but we don't."
344,notsarc,"your logic here really scares me. if his actions werent intrinisicly wrong, i guess there is no absolute that we are morally right to judge him. thats according to you.. and by the way, where did your mother get those convictions from?? and beyond.. there is something in every human heart that knows murder is wrong, stealing is wrong, and so forth. who created that is what i wanna know.."
345,notsarc,"perhaps, perhaps not. that doesn't have anything to do with that the argument that she provided was not prochoice. why should i? she has not made that claim to me. you have, though, so i am pointing out to you that while she may support abortions, the argument you copied is not about prochoice."
346,notsarc,"but they don't enforce it very well at all. before the season they can only test 5% of the players max, and during the season, once you've been tested you can't be tested for the rest of the season. i mean if the teacher left the room during the sat's, do you honestly expect everyone to sit there and not cheat, when doing well can help them get a better standing in life? steroids is just an extreme. you pay a bigger price for it, but you also get better results."
347,notsarc,"no offense, but that is a sick way to think about something. glad to know we can put a price on a life. when ones values money over life we have a serious problem in this country. it really goes against everything we stand for. one cannot be free if they are controlled by money. i happen to think that everyone is equal....everyone....mentally retarded, no legs, one eye, anything. for one to say that the cure for disease is death...this is just sick, makes you wonder what we value these days...money or life? even if you were just about the money, a culture of selfishness will make the economy worse then a culture of selflessness. do we really need to get into historical examples of nations that became too selfish? the end is not pretty."
348,notsarc,"are you saying you only have a hard time having compassion for the gay victims of sexually transmitted illness? if, so that just shows your anti-gay prejudice. what difference does that make? everyone who has aids is a victim. in some communities and in other countries, the majority who have it are straight. against the victims from the largest social group of victims in each jurisdiction? this is nothing more than prejudice and destructive political agenda.  i would hope there are other, better, human instincts inside of you."
349,notsarc,my question is: who's funding this?  no sane investor would give him the money needed to run such a operation especially in israel.
350,notsarc,"originally posted by fracas only way to be more efficient is to continue to wage war preferentially against technologically similar sides are we back to a us-eu war? sorry i took that the wrong way, but regardless, the kind of thinking that leads to wars and seeing who has the largest most powerful military is precisely what i'd like to get away from in order to advance the military. yes we learn from war, but its wasteful, i'm proposing a not so wasteful military."
351,notsarc,"yet everything in that site is cited with sources such as cnn and what not. i understnad the florida right to life is not credible to our discussion(as they are not neutral) however the things they cite are...and that is what you should look at. so murder is a subjective term now...i laugh at that. your point was what again? they fact that vor didn't prove his case and never does? i don't understand....however, maybe if you looked at the sources on that site you would see that it is in the upper 90%s (however this is clinical abortions...not underground ones)."
352,notsarc,"if your faith would prevail over the rule of law then yes it is objectionable. if the judges of concern would follow their faith more then laws of the nation he should not be confirmed.  would a strict muslim who would push islamic beliefs into his judgements be allowed? or a hindu? given that the answer is a no, neither should a strict christian."
353,notsarc,assumption of 'millions'. they must of because how else can we account for the species today ? got any support for this ? i can prove the antidiluvians knew about and used pi. if man began as an ape/animal then how do you explain the fact that pi was not discovered until thousands of years later ? ray m.
354,notsarc,"is it sad? or is it true? if you are going to support discrimination against a group of people, needless discrimination, how can you spin that as being anything but bigotted?  marriage is a personal thing. who we wish to share our lives with, be intimate with, confide or deepest fears to is not a matter of for the public to decide. the majority has no role here. nor should the majority, without a clear state or public interest, decide for the individual what marriage is or who one can marry. and one certainly should be allowed to treat homosexuals any differently before the law than hetrosexuals.  if a persons says they should be discriminated against, it is fair to suggest they are perhaps biggotted or homophobic."
355,notsarc,"sorry bob, i just don't have that super-flux-retentive-memory that allows you gay people to remember all the way back to the moment of exiting the birth canal. guess i'll never know for sure what my 'sexual orientation' was when i was born, but from the time i can remember i've been straight. as far as i'm concerned, i'm content saying that sexual orientation really becomes a matter of identity at puberty. fair enough, i'm not going to argue with you over that. as a parent who has had toddlers, it's awfully hard for me to imagine being able to ascertain something like that at such a young age, but who knows? i was just taking issue with the idea that anyone could possibly truly know they were gay at birth."
356,notsarc,"correct. did you notice that in the scott peterson trial, the judge went around the law in deciding how he should be punished and who has rights? a clear sign of activism, yet none of the righties called him a activist judge even when what he did is by defintion activism. it's a sign they are hugely hypocritical.  vor's got a raging double standard if he calls some judges who do that activist and others who do the same, not."
357,notsarc,"you thought wrong then. for the same reason the jury is still out on the theory of gravity. in reality the jury isn't out in either case. evolution (and gravity) have been demonstrated - beyond all sensible and reasonable doubt - to be fact. this has been explained to you many times before. theory is as good as it gets in science. sciences cannot be proven impirically. no amount of evidence for a scientific theory ever proves it.  prove in what sense? if you are after a simple court type 'proven beyond reasonable doubt', it's been proven already. if you want mathematical proof, then you will wait forever. it's in the bottles of whiskey in your local bar."
358,notsarc,"didn't texas sign it into law a while back that if 3 or more people can identify you as the one who committed the crime that you get no appeals, and go right to the top of the list to be executed? i think this should be the case in every state. while many cases do deserve appeal, many do not. if we got rid of appeals cases on indisputable crimes, we would save quite a bit of taxpayer money."
359,notsarc,so what you're saying is that you can't?  as a political move to satisfy the pro-life constituents that put them in office.
360,notsarc,"where did i 'bitch' about kinds? please quote the post or withdraw the comment. a clue for you: i've never discussed kinds with you, so just apologise and we can move on, eh?"
361,notsarc,"oh please, you have got to be joking. where are you pulling this from? a 'severe retraction of the money supply' causes inflation? it isn't a 'historically founded assumption' or a 'mathematical' certainty, and to deny it is virtually to deny all economics. supply and demand determine price. i care, because the purchasing power of that money correspondingly declines. if you think the government printing currency and spending it does not cause the value of all other currency in circulation to decline, the same must apply to private citizens. why don't we just issue a printing press to every american, then they can all have as much money as they want. you are twisting yourself in a knot trying to justify this lunacy you originally wrote: then ["
362,notsarc,"you choose to distort my post by your suggestion about a 'primitive land': i neither said nor intended to imply as much. try not to let your tendency towards political correctness seek hidden meanings in what are attempts a giving a balanced account of historical events. british imperialism happened: it was not a completely baleful phenomenon. it had some beneficial outcomes even if they were not intended. english happens to be the lingua franca of science, economics, etc. i don't know whether it's uniquely suited to it. do you ? it's obvious that other languages have an input: i'm not making a judgement about them."
363,notsarc,then what did you mention? compensation against stolen goods is insurance against theft.
364,notsarc,"are uk mortgages packaged and peddled as securities as in the us? if so, is that (those) a government or quasi-government agency(s)? i ask to see where the eventual fallout will take place. the uk is much like the us in that when consumers default there's always a substantial amount of private money waiting for those adjustments to buy at the bottom for future resale. if they are in fact packaged, the security holders will have to write down their investments and defaults by the end of their fiscal year, normally determining the length of that cycle. we follow many of your economic cycles but i've never watched your residential real estate market. brown would have a tough time pulling that one out of the fire."
365,notsarc,"hell yes! but that is hardly the only reason. why do you think there was so much hand wringing over the assasination of jfk? the belief on many people was that the soviets had done this and they wanted to get on record immediately that they had nothing to do with it. a lot of people were afraid we were about to go into wwiii with all of the bombs going off. i should know. i was in the military during that time and things got very dicey.  btw, the news is now reporting an evacuation of the wh and capitol building because an airplane has entered restricted air place, within three miles of the capitol. fighter planes were sent to intercept. news just now coming in. probably nothing serious."
366,notsarc,too late. have you stepped foot on a politically correct college campus recently? the former bastions of free speech are worse than almost anywhere else in the us now. emoticonxmad
367,notsarc,about as much 'soverienty' legitimation as hitler had when he was butchering the jews. no cause? you forget about trying to murder bush #41. no cause? you forget about him funding palestinian terrorists at $25k a pop. no cause? you forget about invading kuwait. no cause? he kicked out the u.n. inspectors. no cause? he fired at our airplanes who patrolled the no-fly zones. no cause? the mass graves and stalinist government? and these are just the things we know for certain.
368,notsarc,"so you argue that for some women, abortion is the 'easy way out', and that those women choose to abort, take the easy way out as you say, for arbitrary reasons? could you please reiterate these reasons here (preferably in an enumerated list) and explain why they should be considered arbitrary? indeed. but we've established that supposing a higher profile in the media in no way entails an actual increase in incidents.  so i'll repeat the question, hearsay aside, upon what evidence do you base the assertion that more women are abandoning infants?"
369,notsarc,"oh, and i did see your impressive list in the other thread justinecredible. if i had seen it before i started this thread i wouldn't have started it. i had no idea there were that many hypocritical anti-gay republicans. that list really does make it look like all the really adimant opposers of gay rights are in fact closet gays themselves. i wonder if any of these guys chose to be gay. oh, for those interested in the list, can you link to it, please? i tried to find it again, but i can't. mille grazi!"
370,notsarc,walking-fish: has anyone ever observed two atoms combining to form a molecule? has anyone ever counted out 6.02 x 10^23 molecules to see if they really make up a mole? has anyone ever watched the earth for a year from outer space to see if it really does go around the sun? has anyone ever seen electrons in a copper wire when an eletric current is passed through it? all scientific disciplines are held together by theories which are inferences about things we cannot directly observe. what is it about science that you don't understand?
371,notsarc,"2.0 processor, 2gig ddr, graphics card to 256mg, 17' screen will keep up with software system resource demands for a reasonable period? say two years?  as one who bought an ibm 'everything you'll need with dual floppies and a i believe it was 10mb hard drive' in 1982 and enjoying first hand the progression of that technology and software that drives it for 23-years, this is still a fun ride.  thanks again."
372,notsarc,"yes, it happened through mutation. what do you mean by 'what sort'? i assume you're looking for something more in depth than 'the genetic sort'. i'm afraid i can't rattle off the difference in the sequences if that's what you want. if that's not what you want than you'll have to ask a more specific question."
373,notsarc,obviously i don't have a perfect memory or even that i read what you are referring to. why don't you give me a flavor of their 'factual errors?' and are you talking about their news sections or their opinion pieces? and who wrote it? sometimes in the opinion pieces these are submitted by authors in the nations that are the subject. perhaps this was written by a swedish politician who had an ax to grind.
374,notsarc,"your example is kinda hard to relate however i see your point. you would think they would only make it the cost of the abortion if that is what the male wanted...however, maybe only half of it? i dunno...kind of a weird question. i will think about it more :)"
375,notsarc,"that is a specious argument. the constitution is not an embodiment of what is good and evil for humans to do, but of what is of value in a free society. the constitution does not judge the goodness and badness of human character. ideas for laws come from morality? the concept of morality came from a desire to survive as we evolved. so you see the law preventing someone from interfering with your life as the same as the law allowing someone to interfere with your life?"
376,notsarc,"oh really? what are the tests for 'i.d.'? you have not showed any of those. you have made lots of claims. for example , you made claims about the reduction of the atmosphere.. and i countered with some explainations. here are some peer reviewed scientific articles on it "
377,notsarc,[quote=voice of reason] tell me; exactly how do i think ? don't speak of people you donot even know.
378,notsarc,"i totally agree that it should be more like the organ donor system, though i think a lot of the controversy arises where families of patients have signed away more than they thought (as was the case in the uk, it was legal because the families had actually allowed it not really thinking about it). having never been in the situation (and hopefully never either), i have no idea how confusing or misleading (not intentionally, i think its due to there being a standard question like 'do you mind if parts of the body are used for transplants or research?', only in extreme cases will their be a problem) i don't know who's really to blame. however to ban it completely, especially if its mainly due to a misunderstanding of policy or options i would see as worse. but yes, it should certainly be like organ donation."
379,notsarc,"catholics who practice what? i made no mention of any practices in post. indeed, yet you do not condemn contraception as the church demands. likewise you supported desert storm ii, which the vatican officially condemned."
380,notsarc,"should we clear up what we're talking about at all? i think adultery is legal in 24 states, and i'm pretty sure adultery laws have been pretty much completely unenforced since world war ii. i don't know of any states where a polygamous relationship with no marriage involved is illegal. now, certainly having multiple marriage licenses is illegal..."
381,notsarc,and the other two...? 'political disorder and confusion' is not the same as personal 'disorder and confusion'.
382,notsarc,"why convince me of something i already know? however, the homosexual community does have more of a problem..just like africa has more of a problem then the us."
383,notsarc,"what if it's got nothing to with bigotry? what if, like religion, it takes absolute proof in order to be believed? i think that's what it's going to take. don't you?"
384,notsarc,"is two 'wrongs' more 'wrong' than one 'wrong'?  or perhaps, is two 'bads' more 'bad' than one 'bad'? i would say so.  but perhaps that`s just my utilitarian leanings talking."
385,notsarc,voice of reason: why? it seems like something you could have found out about easily enough.
386,notsarc,did he? what secular evidence do you have from before 70 c.e. that confirms his existance? what is the outside verification to the new testament?
387,notsarc,"i don't understand this one..region and majority? what are you referring to. i don't recall saying anything about dna in the last 4-5 posts however, a human life is more important to me then a dog...yes. it is to you too. so why don't you tell me why?"
388,notsarc,"first of all, i never stated that any medical procedures should be outlawed. you jumped to conclusions. secondly, why are you throwing around the word need like that? in the very few cases (2.8%) where the mother's life may be in jeopardy from the pregnancy, she will need an operation. all other elective abortions are a want. so a woman would never have to go to a quack or butcher for an operation that she needed, if it was illegal for all other elective abortions."
389,notsarc,"was it a 'sexual based movement', as you've called it, then, or a civil rights movement? those opposed at the time, would have more than likely saw it essentially as a 'sexual based movement', led by people who didn't want to stay in the closet about their sexuality."
390,notsarc,exactly my point. how far back do we go ? there has to be a statute of limitations . how about compensating people who actually suffered the injustice? compensating the descendants of slaves.....that is going to be tricky.... some descendants have mixed black/white heritage....who decides if they are entitled to compensation or not ? compensating descendants opens up a can of worms.
391,notsarc,"so wouldn't that cover almost all of africa? there are so many people dying in the city streets of hunger in our own country, yet we elect a president who wants to address a problem in iraq rather than our own country? if we truly tried to help all those less fortunate than ourselves, we would be helping africa a lot more than we are now (their average life expectancy is like 30). yes iraq was terrible, but guess what, other countries might think our country is terrible. that is not our concern and at least we could wait until we fixed all of our own problems first. we have poor hungry starving people on the streets of the us and we go to another country to solve their problems?"
392,notsarc,"i simply quoted to you your own scripture, ez. how is that construed as bashing? de 21:20-21 and they shall say unto the elders of his city, this our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard. and all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die:  mr 16:17-18 and these signs shall follow them that believe; in my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover."
393,notsarc,the iranian govenment was visibly anti-american. did the filipino and dutch cases have that component? i am still quite convinced that americans would hate iran just as much as they accidentally caused american casualities.
394,notsarc,"i too am impressed by detrean's post. is he not an example to the likely solution though? as growing numbers of people in america get sick of this bickering between two extreme groups, they will look to centre-ground polititians with a tolerance of differing views to fill the void and provide an alternative form of government. it might not be a slow process either. there was an interesting article in the observer newspaper (a british left-wing sunday paper) that suggests this backlash may even happen during this presidency (http://observer.guardian.co.uk/inter...514898,00.html)"
395,notsarc,"ok, but a government can't grant benefits/priviledges based on statistical likelihood of an action. blacks are far more likely to be incarcerated than whites, does that mean we can premptively throw them all in jail? no, we create responses based on what people actually do. thus, if a heterosexual or homosexual decides to have children, they should get a tax credit for it. or you can go the reverse, that every married couple gets a tax credit, regardless of whether they have children or not (my personal advocacy). but granted benefits based on statistics is absurdly unfair, if only because people deserve to be treated as individuals, not numbers."
396,notsarc,"can you back up this claim that cancer is spreading? no. evolution isn't 'supposed' to do anything. stuff changes, life goes on. could you transalate this into english please?"
397,notsarc,which will push crude oil prices up in line with the benchmark usd devaluation? treasury interest rates could become interesting. i'm already seeing conventional cd and money market rates on the rise.
398,notsarc,"where is here? you don't seem to want to display your location. we all know there's more than one way to become an american citizen. that said, as an american citizen, english is the native tongue. it's the primary language taught in american schools and it's how our government communicates with its citizenry. i'm not really interested in debating this topic with you, it probably should be a thread unto itself. i think dono was merely pointing out that if you want to make a 'snippy' reply, it carries more weight when correctly spelled."
399,notsarc,"i think that would probably create more problems than it would solve. how would we know? we don't punish. drunk drivers get off incredibly easy so much of the time. we have the weakest anti-drunk driving laws in the western world and we have the worst problem with drunk driving. coincidence? that's not all that far from what i've said. @joe- this is for a whole other discussion, but i think that the first step in aa is a big part of the reason of its low success rate. that's not too far from what i've said either."
400,notsarc,"plenty!! let's start with the buffalo teachers' federation. they are unwilling to switch to a single health care provider from three providers. this, in turn, will lead to further layoffs in the buffalo public school district. how about bethlehem steel? once the largest employer in lackawanna, unreasonable demands for over $20-25/hr salary increases in an industry that was struggling to survive? come on! unions do more harm to business and municipalities than you think!!!"
401,notsarc,"why can't skeptics be reactionary? don't you know people who automatically distrust everything said by bush, or by liberals, or any group you like? why should skeptics be any more objective than the average population? some will be very objective, some will be very reactionary, most will fill in the spectrum in between. i belive that the majority are in the middle, you seem to be focusing on the reactionary end."
402,notsarc,"if you think marriage is sacred then why are you trying to change what it is? i can't say this enough times...marriage is a word that describes a union between man and women. no one created the word marriage and then decided what it would apply to. someone saw and event and gave this event a word...this would be marriage. this 'event' has been sacred since as long as we have records to show. and now, some wish to make it sacred for themselves while destroying the sacred institute that the majority of us wish to keep."
403,notsarc,"'if it's beside the point' the why bring it up, jyoshu. why 'talk out of both sides of your mouth'?  and your right wing talking points are stale and tired. comparing different civil rights movements is not 'piggybacking'. and incidentally, why is it that all of the blacks in congress for equal rights for glbt people? why is it that they are the most passionate defenders of glbt people? there are black gay people who suffered along with the straight black people. there are female gay people that suffered along with the women. on top of such discrimination, gay people may have had no family support. some were probably lobotomized against their wishes. some were raped, some were probably murdered by people they thought would understand what discrimination was all about. no, my friend. it is disingenuous to say with certainty that you know they have not."
404,notsarc,i think you may be very very suprised by roberts. i like some of the answers he is giving. i have a feeling you conservates may get f***cked. he is not as conservate as you think. besides even if he is conservate he certainly is not as conservate as the emoticonxcensored he is replacing.  as a citizen of virginia do you support this law that strips people of their wills and powers of attorny? http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp...41+ful+hb751s1 this is just a very mean law and will hurt many people.
405,notsarc,and you believe that to be what? you really need to just say who/what you think the creator is to save us from having to make all these clarification posts.
406,notsarc,why is being christian seen as being 'conservative'? surely there are plenty of jewish and muslim conservatives. i've known some indian hindus (is there any other kind?) that were very conservative. what if there was a hindu organization that taught or espoused conservative values?  would they make these people's list? i doubt it.
407,notsarc,"pay attention. age of consent is still the topic and point. if teen pregnancy is reduced to statistically acceptable levels through education and contraception with medical risk being a negligible five-decimal point factor, that would position teen sex emotional distress as a good/bad societal interpretation designated by non-teens, would it not? which would negate chronological age of consent for legal sex to a non-status unless those non-teens making the laws had another agenda."
408,notsarc,"howard, i didn't ask who jesus believed or said he was. i'm asking you who you say jesus is? this is basic confession of christ. jesus even asked his disciples. who do you say jesus christ is? the long awaited jewish messiah? your resurrected savior for the remission of your sins? the great god and savior (2 peter 1:1)? simple yes's or no's will suffice."
409,notsarc,"in what passages does jesus refer to his junior partner? i'm not saying he did not, rather, i'm not recalling off the top of my head any specific mention of the holy ghost by jesus."
410,notsarc,"ms. bennet, in your opinion, is the anglican church apostolic? if so, what is the case that it presents for apostolic succession? the roman church did not start as an imperial church. the empire wasn't around for 300 years or so. i think many martyrs of the faith would differ with that assertion. it started at peter's appointment as the foundation of the church and was solidified in the upper room after jesus' resurrection. why do you desire to receive communion at a catholic church?"
411,notsarc,"let me guess - you also believe that moses wrote the torah, wherein he describes his own death and burial? 'wild theory'? i suggest you do an internet search on the synoptic problem and the related two-source theory.  why do you demand that which you know cannot be produced? no, we don't have the q source, but we have evidence which points to a q source. likewise, we have a great deal of evidence which suggests that the torah had multiple authors."
412,notsarc,"i totally agree. you never know what you might pick up. but he likes to eat hey? that's weird. but to each his own. i like to eat more normal food myself. but if you explore certain sides of someones personality, do you really learn anything? how do you know you just don't watch and then five minutest after you explore the personality, you forgot everything about that person. i mean, i don't know, but i have some trouble picking up on personalities right away of people i meet. has anyone ever tried spilling tuna on the floor on purpose? i'm just wondering because that would be weird."
413,notsarc,"no, god doesn't force the murderer to murder his victim, but god knew that it would happen and it did happen for a reason known to god. god allows it to happen because he does not interfere with free will. how can it not be part of god's plan? his plan does not just include people free of sin, because we have all sinned. his plan includes sinners as well."
414,notsarc,do you think banning guns would stop people who wanted them from getting them? also you failed to address my point. is self-defense not a legitimate use for guns?
415,notsarc,ya but does anyone of these have a living god to support their belief? no! only christians do! thats why in the end some will go to heaven and some will go to 'the pit'
416,notsarc,"well, i'm back from my rejuvenating outing. did i have any epiphanies, you ask?  what, one wonders, could the old masters have produced if their minds were unrestricted, their canvases allowed to contain any subject capable of being conceived, without the censorious church acting as final arbiter and judge? mankind could have had this centuries earlier to uplift us in troubling times, and ennoble us in our daily pursuits."
417,notsarc,"then why is there such thing as original sin??? it's extremely hypocritical. from what you just said, sex is allowed, but it's also not allowed. emoticonxfrazzled"
418,notsarc,"most serial killers in american are male, christian and american. just like you.:) there are millions of arab children. there aren't millions of suicide bombers. how do you explain this? the post two posts up asks for numbers. got any bassman? -wez"
419,notsarc,"i think i'd wait maybe another year or so to go hunting. it may be hard for someone that age to sit still for very long out in the woods. it might be fun to start introducing him to the woods by just going for a walk and looking for animals...squirrels, turkeys, deer, etc... fishing would be awesome too. little kids like to see fish, and a fishing trip may produce more opportunities to see animals.  you're from minnesota? that's cool, me too...i completely understand how hunting is a part of life up here. :p good luck hunting this year!"
420,notsarc,an infant isn't capable of living on its own even after being delivered. what level of support differentiates 'developed enough' from not developed enough? the age in which a premature baby can be kept alive is down in the 5 1/2 month range now and will likely drop further as science continues to progress. so is the distinction that you make based on today's science or something eelse?
421,notsarc,"ephesians does indeed talk of salvation through faith created in christ jesus unto good works(2:10). i must admit that im not totally sure what this means, that faith leads to good works? id dispute that. whilst most of romans does talk of salvation through faith, romans 2:6 says however god will render to every man according to his deeds. in the end, the point is moot. i dont really care if the bible does say that man is justified by faith alone (and it doesnt conclusively), my point is that i am unwilling to worship a creature that justifies only by faith anyway."
422,notsarc,"jp: you keep spouting the same inaccuracy. i have already given you the cornell law schools definition and explanation of the impeachment process. do you need harvard and dukes as well? the house brought a resolution of impeachment. the senate denied it. the house resolution is similar to an indictment. the senate denial is similar to a not guilty verdict. your need to distort demeans you. really? who are you, carnack the magnificent? you can tell what would happen. richard nixon resigned and his offense was not as serious for the national security as the underlying offense is for libby. bottom line is you dont know what would happen. nobody does. but is does reveal that the only basis for you erroneous rhetoric is your speculation and distortion.."
423,notsarc,"third degree? dono posted something that confused me, so i was asking for clarification. of what concern is it to anyone whether gay people marry? adopt? what concern is it of mine whether female infants have their vaginas sewn up, for that matter? why should anyone care whether women have abortions, as well? again, where is the line drawn between concern over an issue and obsession? yay for you? there were black people who thought slavery was just fine, too, so i see this as evidence of nothing more than your own muddy thinking."
424,notsarc,"do you believe the average individual actually has any personal control over providing basic essentials and security? most individuals exist from proceeds of a 'job' or government programs and would be lost without one or the other, of which they generally have no actual influence.  i find it difficult to accept that the average, individual us citizen has the brain power to be concerned about anything but what's on tv. voter apathy of 25% or less participation in municipal elections are a strong indication of individual need to be manipulated as governing powers see fit."
425,notsarc,"no, i don't admit it - i don't know what your definition of 'scientest' is. dictionary.com defines one like this; i guess i need your opinion of what 'expert knowledge' is. does your 'scientest' have to be on the public payroll? does micheal behe not fit the bill for you? many people consider id to be a valid scientific theory. why is that not good enough for you? must we have only the intelligensia make our decisions for us? how familiar are you with the us constitution?"
426,notsarc,"our sense data cannot tell us in an absolute sense that there is a real object, just that there appears to be a real object. all of the experiences of all humanity make it appear as if what we experience is real. does that mean that it is absolutely real? possibly not, but i would think that that possibility is small since none of our mutual experiences hint at those sensory inputs not being real."
427,notsarc,"valid argument? dna is a great tool, but not a factor in most cases. the fact is that innocents will be executed. what do christians consider an acceptable ratio? dono"
428,notsarc,jp: i have been searching recent supreme court decisions and cannot find the one on penn v bullock. do you have the info on it? i am very interested. thanks.
429,notsarc,"how do you define 'immoral?' do you define it as expressing absolute truths about god and his standards of conduct? if so, then you have a misplaced set of values. contrary to popular opinion, god's standards never change. so why should his people (concerning morality)? again, it comes back to the homosexual mantra of 'tolerance' where everybody must accept their lifestyle. but one cannot object nor question their misplaced 'values.'"
430,notsarc,"upper class surely? would imagine that support for capitilism extends as far, if not further in the upperclass than the working class. though surely the prinicples behind the thing would just as much to protect the majority from a minority as vice versa, its just generally its not supposed to happen that way."
431,notsarc,"didn't intend to, he was in fact an enlisted soldier in ww1. my implication was so what? he was far better known as a failed artist."
432,notsarc,"poverty may seem insurmountable today, but wouldn't water-born disease have seemed that way a century ago? yet we are not many years away from everyone in the world having access to clean water and sanitation."
433,notsarc,"yet the message didn't get through to the jews. another indicator that the 12 apostles were ineffectual? here's a specific game plan, a blueprint to follow for the group, a to-do list. yet it required another miracle from jesus, already ascended in heaven. he had to find someone else to jump-start his foundering ministry: paul. jesus must have been sorely disappointed at his followers and their results to have to conjure up another miracle this late in the scheme.  what were they doing hanging around jerusalem when they were to be preaching to all ends of the earth? nice thoughts maximus, but the record shows nothing i would want to aspire to."
434,notsarc,"yeah you're saying what it isn't but not saying what it is. i'm not sure what you mean as physical either. can i ask you out straight -- are you suggesting a metaphysical component to 'you'? this questions just, i feel, needs to be answered because i'm still trying to grasp what your saying. to a degree? as soon as it changes you are something else surely? i would be wraith +1 or, after a heavy night out wraith -20 -- the 'wraith' bit is just seemingly a conveniance to show nothing more than perceived lineage -- i'm not the same frame of refference at any given point as i was a second ago. i might as well be called cow +20 after eating, and assimilating a beef burger, the lineage part really is quite meaningless."
435,notsarc,"sooo mr./ms. admin? did you mean this plastic gun? or the plastic gun with lots of steel? why is this important? the same thing was tried by brady.org a few years ago when 'plastic' guns were become available. they deliberately tried to incite fear of 'plastic' guns. all you have acomplised if it were not for vigilant freedom loving americans, would have been to perputate this fear through myth and misinformation. i would like to hear from any anti-gunners out there? did any of you buy into the 'plastic' gun fear? did you mr/ms admin? did you buy into the 'plastic' gun fear?"
436,notsarc,"but why should i care about their emotions? they obviously don't care about mine. this is in reference to the jonestown massacre, where this cult leader convinced his followers to drink a soft drink (i don't think it was actually kool-aid) laced with cyanide. okay."
437,notsarc,"but what about the many cases where that sort of thing doesn't happen? do you really think that every case of someone finding out a person is involved in the homosexual way of life results in being kicked out of a home, church, or job? the problem with your view is that it has no room for people who disagree but don't do these things you say. and that happens all the time."
438,notsarc,"so do you think before you speak? abraham left mesopotamia, modern day iraq, for canaan to start a new religion. so where did he start the religion? canaan, modern day israel.  and yes i know that there is much more to the bible and my point was that you can't believe the bible 100 percent world for world or you would be contradicting yourself."
439,notsarc,i concede that it can go to a ballot. you have been arguing that such an issue should go to a ballot.  care to comment on the second point i made? to some extent this thread is about whether anyone should be concerned that all the petition signers realized what they were signing (in the context of proven wide-spread fraud on the part of the signature gatherers).
440,notsarc,"well, can you prove that the adhernents of 'humanism' use it with ardor and faith? nope. it is a philophy though.. on the ethical manner on how to treat your fellow man. that last one, you could have 'republicanism', or 'being a political red neck' to be a religion."
441,notsarc,[quote=aussieseek.com] so to all the posters here i ask the question. why are you in favour of people with mental problems owning guns.? [quote] that is one heck of an assertion for a newbie. why do you assume we are in favor of that? i do not see anyone saying that. ef
442,notsarc,"so if you were starving to death would you steal a loaf of bread? morals depend on the situation you are in. if teachers were to teach them, they would not be taught as such. teachers would say 'don't steal', but they won't say 'don't steal unless you need to do so to survive, or need to save another's life, or....' morals would be taught as absolute rules, rather than relative ones. this is the problem with teaching them. my personal stance on morals is basically that others should be treated with respect and how you would want to be treated by them. but i would not necessarily extent this respect to someone who i knew had acted immorally. we are actually debating whether it is morally right for teachers to teach morals :)"
443,notsarc,"what did sanger say specifically that leads you to this conclusion? the preceding is from wikipedia. now, perchance, does 'cleaner' possibly mean having been exposed to enough medical information to be aware of veneral diseases so as to know how to avoid them? do you have an aversion to accurate information about stds being available?"
444,notsarc,"based on what? you admit there were 800,000 abortions performed in 1973 but yet if you dared to check the fertility rate between 1972 to 1973 it is nearly static; meaning there were just as many people giving birth before and after roe. surely, 800,000 potential births being aborted would have cut the fertility rate sharpely but it didn't.  you don't have to be a rocket-scientist to speculate what this means; that just as many women were having abortions between 1972 - 1973 and roe v wade only changed who was performing these abortions...not whether people were having them or not."
445,notsarc,"have you ever had strawberries? blueberries? raspberries? oranges? grapefruits? i can't name quite as many vegetables that i think are good, but you get the point. there are many fruits that at least in my opinion beat the junk food in cafeterias any day. how about some real meat? you like cheese? you like ham? turkey? roast beef? salami? i'm sure i'm missing some but you can make a very good sandwhich with any of these. along with this i don't think it would hurt much to have something like a candy bar as well. i usually have: ham and cheese sandwhich, muffin, a fruit, a vegetable, crackers or something like that, a desert of some kind (candy bar, cookies, etc.). still tastes good, but it is a lot healthier than the school lunches (and in my opinion tastes better too)."
446,notsarc,"there is plenty of evidence on what kind of marriage the clintons have. i am not making this up out of whole cloth, i am referring to the jr. senator's own words in her memoir 'living history': hillary rodham clinton felt 'dumbfounded, heartbroken and outraged' when she learned of the affair and said that she could 'hardly breathe' when she learned the rumors of the affair were true. 'gulping for air, i started crying and yelling at him: 'what do you mean? why did you lie to me?' mrs clinton writes.  doesn't sound like such a swingin good time ey what? but don't take my word for it, go down to the library and read pg 502.  i stand by my previous thesis."
447,notsarc,how exactly is terrorism not a criminal act? i don't see what you're getting at.
448,notsarc,"here's the thing about stem cell research... how would stem cell research go against the christian faith. does it go against christ to heal the sick? medicnes could improve greatly with the use of stem cell research. i'll quicky mention 2 people (1 still alive and one dead) who could have (or could be) greatly healed with stem cell research. for one, christerpher reeves could have still been alive if stem cell research could have been done. michael j. fox (and others with parkingson's (sp?) disease) could be greatly helped with the use of stem cell research. oh, and one other thing. bush has no family values. not just tearing apart gay families but also straight families. he sends husbands/fathers, wives/mother's, sons and daughters over to fight a war that we have no business in being in anyway."
449,notsarc,did you read the artical? to show our children that they are no different then any other.
450,notsarc,"perhaps. but which would you rather have: promiscuity without protection or with? the distinction can matter, so if there is going to be promiscuity going on, i for one would perfer to see it be safe-sex, as much as possible. but even better would be if a person not being promiscuous at all, imo anyway."
451,notsarc,"if the distinction matters, then what is your point about promiscuity, exactly? misinformation msleads people into thinking that if the significantly curtail the number of partners they have sex with, that they would eliminate the chance of contracting disease. that is not true. it just takes one time with an infected person. protection is what people should be arguing. it would be much better if people were upfront about sex and sexuality, upfront about their hiv status, and used protection at all times during sex."
452,notsarc,"well, if one must make a choice, then let's make the question more pertinent to this discussion. from a public health perspective regarding aids, which would be better: all sex outside a momogamous relationship between tested individual protected, whether promiscuous or not or only promiscuous sex protected and non-promiscuous sex unprotected? (leaving aside a common definition of 'promiscuous' -- you use your mysterious definition, i'll use mine.) i'd vote for the former. you? well, if you want gay people to be less promiscuous (still without a determined definition), support our full integration into the larger culture and stop calling us immoral. in the long run, we'll end up acting just as randy -- or not -- as anyone else."
453,notsarc,"is this what jpsartre meant? at any rate, to say that there were large numbers of gay men, being infected in the u.s., is not saying there is a connection between aids or its spread and homosexuality in itself. there is a connection when there is active sexuality, gay or straight, and aids is a sexually transmitted disease. we actually don't know who patient zero was. what is the point of saying initially it affected much larger numbers of gay men, and fewer heterosexuals, to the best of our available knowledge? this is a disease, and unknowingly spreading it, no matter who you are, is not murder. the fact that much more transmission was initially occuring in a certain group, who had sex among that group, before that group knew it existed and what it was and how to prevent it; that would also not be murder."
454,notsarc,"i'm sorry, but i find this completely ridiculous and unfounded. i can see (remotely) how abortion might be considered anti-woman (although it is of course anti-life before being anything else), but how has christianity directly sanctioned the questions of women's suffrage, spousal abuse, property ownership, social status, etc.? by the way, do you consider fundamentalists to be the best representatives of a religion? i am catholic, and i believe i understand the dogmas and principles of my faith quite enougth to say that nothing of what you have mentioned (except abortion, because it has nothing to do with women's rights) are viewed positively by the catholic church, or ever have been. please explain with details."
455,notsarc,"we could make this a little contest i suppose and see who gets the most right. for the primary categories anyway. picture, acting, directing, writing, any others? also definitely say what you think will, and what you think should."
456,notsarc,"if i recall correctly, many of the fires were started at about the same time, so more than one person seems likely. and weren't they mostly black churches that have been targeted? i wouldn't discount racism as the motive."
457,notsarc,i prefer to just pop out the cards rather than fool with the cords. i keep a usb cord plugged in and handy right under my monitor. i'm thinking of getting one of those mini card readers and then i won't even have to hunt around for a usb port.  i'll have to check the one you mention above. i don't need a professional quality one but one that is easy to use and i can snap something that doesn't require me to get out the manual to figure out. is it easy to use? about how much would that cost me? my 3.1 is ok but not as clear as i would like.
458,notsarc,"how does making 'the woman's responsibility' solve anything? some women have irregular periods or take contraceptive pills (which sometimes fail) that stop them having periods. i agree it is not the norm, but it is hardly unheard of. there have been recorded cases of people not knowing until the birth."
459,notsarc,"thats how you make it a federal issue...or in this case a constitutional federal issue. what on earth are you quoting? we only have 7 articles in the us constitution. i never said heterosexual marriage is a protected right..in fact, i said the opposite. the right to marry is not a constitutional right. i don't know...i think maybe 'activist' is a bad word to use now....i think 'constituional revisionist' is a better fit. you haven't even quoted the us constitution where it says marriage is a protected right. i am not even in the majority...so i don't see what your arguement is. you are just another person trying to relate political parties to different ways to interupt the constitution. i talk the 'your personal views dont belong in judging' view. this doesn't follow a conservative nor a liberal viewpoint."
460,notsarc,why don't they just ask the teachers? that's what the teachers are there for after all. -wez
461,notsarc,"so you are asking how a gravitational field overcomes the intertia of a less massive object placed within said field? i don't know but your question kind of confused me: in this example the only reason the object is not moving is because you are exerting an opposing force to counter that which the warped space has induced on the object (gravity). all that has changed when the object is released is it can accelerate freely and we can observe the resulting notion. i see what you are getting at- the question could be rephrased as how is an object in a region of warped space constantly under an acceleration towards the centre of the gravitional field, the strength of which depends upon the size of the bodies and the distance separating the two?"
462,notsarc,"obviously you have that right, just as others have a right to vote to re-institute slavery. i'm not even talking about voting, i'm talking about this debate. why do you care if gays call their relationship marriage or not? if i don't know anything about you, please tell me how this does effect you (you imply that it does)."
463,notsarc,"could you clarify the italicized sentence for me, please? i don't understand if you are saying that the fetus takes priority or not. if so, why?thanks...monday morning fogginess."
464,notsarc,why not? people that support abortion hold the view that the woman is more important than the unborn. if you rank humans and force something upon a certain group in one case why wouldn't you approve of it in another? eugenics is just saying a certain group of citizens is below another...kinda like an unborn is below a female...and then saying 'we are going to make sure you don't reproduce and we will put you in this home'...with abortion you just kill the person. atleast sanger took her views to the only logical conclusion.
465,notsarc,if you want to use this arguement then you are assuming a right to free speech seperate from the 1st amendment. you are applying the first amendment but rather assuming 'free speech' is a right granted outside of the constitution. i believe our argument is dealing with applying the first amendment to the states. the case didn't deal with the first amendment at all. where did you get that idea from? it dealt with religion but that is about as close as it gets. ok? was there ever any doubt that the 1st amendment was incorporated since cantwell?
466,notsarc,"who is the 'anyone' you're referring to? how many people in this administration have access to the highest level of intelligence necessary to make this assertion? when the president of the united states tells the american people he is invading another country because he has irrefutable evidence that they possess wmd's, i for one, expected to find proof they existed. maybe they should have said, 'we really think they have wmd's in iraq, it will cost about a trillion dollars to look for them, is everyone ok with this?'"
467,notsarc,"what? i have a guess as to what you meanby this, but its worded very oddly."
468,notsarc,"why do so many lifers just skip right past the pregnancy as if it has no impact? i am not talking about parenting. i don't advocate forcing anyone to parent. ever. that is why i support safe haven laws, signing away of parental rights, etc. i am talking about pregnancy. only a woman can be pregnant and should have the ultimate say in whether or not she is. it is her body, not your's, not the state's, not the church's, and not the fetus'.  when it comes to pregnancy - you wish only to legislate the bodies/reproductive organs of women. i bet you would not advocate chemical castration for any male who is not yet ready to be a parent."
469,notsarc,listen if they can be nasty to me i can be equally nasty to them. what part of equailty do you not understand? equality one way or the other that is my over riding concern right and wrong are secondary.
470,notsarc,"not entirely sure whether you are agreeing with me or not:)  i also presume the reference to 'george' relates to the us president ?? if so then i'm afraid the one thing they have done is underestimate the terrorists and, then, in a way realising that, have gone over the top. apart from their fanaticism there is absolutely nothing to indicate that terrorists are anything other than just as capable of planning etc as any other man. indeed all their actions have indicated that they are extremely capable. we have to be more so"
471,notsarc,"that was a similar argument used for every single scientific discovery since the beginning of time. were is the biblical proof that god doesn't want cloning? those that said the earth was round instead of flat were labled heretics. many people believed flying should be left to the birds that god created. in fact, some faith's still believe that science is wrong, medicine is a sin. it is a good thing that we don't let religion dictate our science, or we'd still be thumping eachother with clubs and eating raw meat. pride caused the fall of the son of morning, not scientific discovery."
472,notsarc,"i can understand the gay couple adoption, but how does that fit with an unmarried man/woman situation? i'm not trying to give you a hard time. i'm only trying to understand the legal aspect of the relationships between you, your son and his new father.emoticonxconfused  again, congratulations. i've always believed that a father and mother were the best environment for a child to grow up with. emoticonxgood"
473,notsarc,"how is our wish and demands for equality forcing our views on you? how is my marriage to a man infringing upon you in any way? how is me being protected from being fired because i am gay infinging upon you in any way? how is my being able to adopt as a gay man infringing upon you in any way? we are asking for the same things heterosexuals take for granted every day. religious groups are trying to stop that equilaty drive by imposing their sick evil religious views though the law. if something effects my life it is being forced upon me if something does not effect your life it is not being forced on you. btw i am still waiting for a copy of this agenda. the religious tight christonazi oganizations, such as afa seem to believe there is one. please i want a copy."
474,notsarc,"how so? i would think 'they shall surely be put to death' (as the av has it) is a commandment, and clearly addressed to the faithful. how can one pick and choose what to take as a commandment and what is god, for want of a better way of putting it, talking to himself!"
475,notsarc,"they illegally invaded and are now illegally occupying land? that is a land feud. however, israel is there now and there is no turning back from them occupying that land. however as to that estimate of a 1000 to one thats a bit over the top and exagerated. i do agree with you that if israel went to withdraw to their *natural* borders they would still be attacked. however, israel isn't committing a genocide on the palestinian people, thats just an exageration. i could just as easily say the whole arab world is commiting a genocide on the israel people. but i don't say that. emoticonxangel  also i can see your point about the information given on areil sharon and hamas. however, the palestinians leaders have allowed terroist attacks for years and have been linked to many weapon trades. emoticonxkill"
476,notsarc,why are you trying to turn this into a religious debate? no one said anything about finding jesus. all you have done is show your anti-god prejudice.
477,notsarc,could you see language evolving in non social animals? it wouldnt have a reason to.
478,notsarc,"do we want to have control over ourselves? some religios fanatics dont, and thats what im saying. i dont know much on this matter, im only 14. but, ive been to a conservative catholic school, and ive seen what it's like. its a narrow minded hellhole."
479,notsarc,"hmmm, the employment, housing, and accommodation thing is really state based and for employment i am pretty sure every state doesn't allow you to ask about sexual orientation.  as for marriage...anyone is allowed to marry (so long as they are of age). you just have a problem with the definition of marriage. as for the military thing...seems like a complicated issue. where does a gay man shower for example? the womans bathroom? there own special bathroom? the mens bathroom? other issues involving relationships could arise as well. as for the adoption thing...only florida doesn't allow it outright."
480,notsarc,"where'd you find it? i've been wanting to listen to it, but wasn't able to find it from a google search."
481,notsarc,"hasn't every generation moaned about the younger generation? isn't that just a natural aspect of growing older? the current younger generation will do the same in due time, of course. (although loki's got there early!;)) loki: your myspazz says you're going to reading festival. are you camping? if slutty dressing, underage sex, underage drinking, drugs and general chaos worry you, you'll be mortified at reading.:p i'm going as well actually (living in reading and all), but none of the above bother me much. it's their choice after all and i know if someone had a go at me for some of the above i wouldn't be particularly happy. edit: your pictrues (the moving ones) contain underage drinking and slutty dressing. -wez"
482,notsarc,"ok, so none can be shown. how many people with a life sentence without parole have died an prison and been innocent?  my point being that a mistake doesn't make the sentence not worth having. in fact, with the death penalty you get more due process than someone with a life sentence...there aren't many advocates for helping those guys out."
483,notsarc,"well if you could scientifically test for the supernatural, it wouldn't really be supernatural, would it? if some god or gods acted in ways that could be predicted and measured by scientific processes, it would be no different to any natural part of the universe."
484,notsarc,try and think about this then. you think the jury is going to be put under external influence to make an unbiased decision if firearms are in the court room. what other decision makers may have this problem if guns are allowed almost everywhere? the president? the senate? judges? don't expect that the jury can't be influenced either. the room cleaning service at their hotels will easily be able to have access to them if they wish and well armed of course.
485,notsarc,"d. adams? :)  this is, of course, an entire debate unto itself. i fully concede that logic dictates that we accept the possibility of life elsewhere. but that it's probable? we simply don't have the data to make that leap. we've got some good theories about how life started here, but we don't know exactly what happened. and even if we did, we don't know how common those conditions are 'out there'. if the conditions for life to arise are so bizarre that they only occur once every 20 billion years, and for all we know they might be, than we may well be the only life in the universe. logically, we just can't say. we don't have enough info to apply logic to the problem."
486,notsarc,"wow, you're only 17? i definately had you in mid 30's maybe early 40's."
487,notsarc,"'compelling argument'? so do you believe the basis of what he's claiming? and are you ready to debate it? because there is no 'overall effect on society and traditional family' from gay marriage. the 'traditional family' has been having its own problems, and has been in decline in these countries long before gay marriage ever was legalized. it's like a guy jumping out of an airplane, and he starts falling to the ground. three seconds later gay marriage is legalized, and conservatives want to blame the fact that he's falling on gay marriage... it makes no sense. there is no causality here... do straight people say, 'hey! gay marriage is legal. i don't want to get married now.' do straight people say, 'hey! gay marriage is legal. i want to get a divorce now.' the 'most compelling argument' lacks any semblance of sense."
488,notsarc,"take a look at your post no. 80 time-stamped 6-26-06 09:55am wherein you said ...in response to my post #79 wherein i said: does that not comply with my claim that you change what i say? back in post #77, i requested that you quote and debunk the links. you merely scoffed at them (as i expected). prior to initiating any other question to me or introducing a tangential argument, please explain the above. i'll be back next week."
489,notsarc,"were they being slaughtered by their own before we pulled our little invasion stunt? no. true many of them were dying horribly under the weight of the sanctions that we were enforcing, but they were not being slaughtered by their own. we went in there, destabilized the country based on lies from our president, with no real plan for controlling the place once we worked our magic. we were actually stupid and arrogant enough (at least some of us) to believe that our system is so vastly superior to anything else in the world that the iraqis would just line up to be our unofficial 51st state. didn't work out that way.  now we find ourselves fighting on the side of the islamic fundamentalists against those who do not want to live in a country controlled by iran. worlds a funny place."
490,notsarc,"who said pregnancy is the only bad thing? we already talked about ceverical cancer. furthermore, condoms don't always work...bad protection. maybe not, but wearing a bright red sign that says 'stalk me' sure will get the ones that are out there. your limited world shield you from the realities of life...which is really a bad thing i suppose but it gives a better reason to listen to your parents. aren't you a warm-hearted person you are in cancun talking to people on a pointless forum... does anyone else think this is rather odd?"
491,notsarc,"the top 10% of people in this country pay 67% of the taxes. most of the money from the middle class? no, not at all."
492,notsarc,"it is more than the claimed evidence is questionable. it is that the evidennce that is claimed is not evidence of what is claimed. someone might take a snippet of fact or perception and see 'see, this is evdience of god'. however, it is not 'evidence of god' unless you assume god first.  i remember distinctly going out to a 'haunted' house with a friend. they pointed excitedly to the ghost they saw in the upstairs window. i had to point out to them, it wasn't ghsot at all, but rather it was the reflection of a street light. now, was that light in the window evidence of a ghost?? nope. was it claimed to be?? yep.  same thing with the 'evidence' for prayer causing the terminally ill to become healthy. it does not hold up to scruntiny."
493,notsarc,"really? so suppose that you have two models for the way the solar system works. you measure where the planets are today in the night sky, and you use both models to predict where the planets will be ten years from now. in ten years you make actual measurements. the predictions of the first model for mars are off by, say, a tenth of a minute of arc. the second model is off by a hundredth of a minute of arc. (for comparison, the full moon in the sky has a width of about 30 minutes -- i may be wrong about this). so, are you saying the first model is wrong? the error seems to be pretty tiny (by most standards). what about the second?"
494,notsarc,"backpedaling? how's that? my original answer is that it's wrong to force children to have sex with old men. that is my answer still. where has it changed? in fact, each post i've made is an affirmation of the one before it. how is that backpedaling? there are absolute goods and evils. that is, there are certain things that are good or bad. how is that saying something different? certain things are bad. period. just like certain things are wrong, no matter how many people think that they aren't wrong. period. is that clear enough for you? i hope so because that's what i've been saying all along and you'd have to be high to think i've changed my position."
495,notsarc,"no your question isn't about 'right to life', but more appropriate your questioned should be 'do they have a right to continue life'? and my answer is absolutely yes!  at the living single cell, when the unique properties of a complete human being is created, it is living, not dead. who has a right to kill another human being's living existance? no one has that right in a civil society, but we haven't reached that society yet, but one day maybe."
496,notsarc,"the following have published disputing primarily the effect of humans on climate change, but have also challenged the core science behind global warming -  tad murty jan veizer ross mckittrick/steven mcintyre that's just 4 guys i picked off the top of my head. i'm sure i could post you a list of a hundred or more, but would it really matter? you may not agree with them, but the fact remains that they are competent scientists who interpret the data differently than you do (or at least those on the side you've chosen to take do). it's pretty clear to me that the data is not indisputable, and that there is not a complete consensus among those qualified to speak on the data.  the problem is, al gore is out making movies while these guys are actually doing scientific research. waxy"
497,notsarc,"it's a pretty obvious counter question, i'm surprised it caught him so off guard. what's his name, if you don't mind my asking? i've got friends in illinois who would appreciate knowing about this, if they're in his district."
498,notsarc,"well, you ignored the part where i said 'voting'. but imo legislative solutions are part and parcel to popular appeal because legislators are voted in on that basis. any legislator claims to 'do what's right.' so elections tend to be popularity contests. and legislators tend to want to keep their constituents happy. oh and just to make sure you understand this kronos so as not to get off in the wrong direction, this is my opinion, just like everything else i've said. it is not a lie. how is that even relevant? i never claimed it was a first resort."
499,notsarc,"one idea per episode? there were always at least 4; one for each main character. and they always linked together perfectly. with the exception of a few episodes at the beginning and the last one, seinfeld was always gold.  the simpsons, on the other hand, has sucked for the last few years when they turned to the 'pick a celebrity guestspot' system."
500,notsarc,"i'm concerned with u.s. history. i'd rather go back 200 years. i'll see what i can find - out of time tonight however.  isn't the big bang part of evolution? i don't notice atheist authors, or the aclu, using it in politics much.  what else can influence morals?"
501,notsarc,"if you want the benefits of marriage, get married. but you ought to be able to marry a person of your choice. your suggestion would be to marry someone i don't want to me married to, that is a different thing. it is not using 'that logic'. i thought marriage was supposed to mean something to you. isn't it supposed to mean a commitment with rights and responsibilities? i am not proposing that anyone enters into that commitment lightly. i happen to think that's a bad idea. people get married for many reasons, some of which i would feel are not good reasons, but i would not make it illegal to do so.  i am talking about the right to marry a person of your choosing."
502,notsarc,"jito, you said that you have a 'fabulous kid.' is this how you would describe your pregnancy and his birth--as you do above? was it just another pee? was there no 'romance' or beauty or emotion or love involved? was it merely a biological occurence? if one cannot see the beauty and joy in love and babies and birth, i hope they will awaken to the wonders of the world. woman have many gifts. motherhood is a great one--the very powerful influence of shaping the future in our children. but yes, women are capable of much more. i have not said otherwise. my statements have been reduced to a perceived condescension. i will address more of your posts later."
503,notsarc,"jito, i forgot to thank you for agreeing with me on eugenics. what is that?...the second or third time we have ever agreed? well, you have only 8,966 more things to agree on with me to show you have converted to proper thinking! emoticonxangel  consent is relevant when it is relevant. do you deny that women engaging in sexual intercourse (outside of rape or some other type of coercion) give consent to engage in an act that may result in pregnancy? i never said that sex was only for procreation and i don't believe it is. i do believe, however, that the procreative potential of sex must be respected. i do believe that when a being comes about as the result of a sexual act then that being should be respected."
504,notsarc,"what knowledge do you have concerning haliburton?  they are a conglomeration construction companies who, because of their qualifications, get overseas contracts. knowledge of codes and history of quality being factors. you seem to oppose their success. why?"
505,notsarc,"who appointed you forum moderator? i just asked obvious child what he thought should be done with iran? i never claimed to have all the answers, but i do share my opinions like everyone else here does.  seig heil to you too!"
506,notsarc,"if a frog had wings he wouldn't bump his butt when he jumped. based on results paul had more influence. how can you simply ignore the obvious? christianity has hurt itself over and over again because of it's unwillingness to concede that sometimes it's wrong. how long did it take the church to acknowledge the earth moves around the sun or that the earth wasn't flat.  instead they either ignore the issue, bury it through violence or intimidation, or come up with some ridiculous idea that is based on nothing to justify why they are right."
507,notsarc,"can you think of the mental trauma of having your rapists baby? and then caring for it? for rape victims, no i still don't think abortion should be the first choice, but it should be available."
508,notsarc,"probably because the article is irrelevant. either way, i posted an article to make you happy so quit compaining and just answer the question with some respect. thanks for just simply answering dog....i'm not sure why it is so complicated. if you don't ask race than how can you be prejudice? there is also no proof that people would currently be discriminated against. but current affirmative action is a topic for another thread."
509,notsarc,"and you can thank the unions with their inflated wage/benefit packages they strongarmed from companies/municipalities for the high cost.  oh yes it is. new york is the only state where pbulic sector jobs, which bring little to no growth to an economy actually outpace the private sector. and you still think that heavy industry is the end-all be-all to economic survival?? america has a dynamic economy, not static."
510,notsarc,is homophobia an instinct? because i really have no clue where it came from...
511,notsarc,doesn't that depend on exactly what israel is doing? you can't treat the country as a whole in everything.  do i support some of their actions? no. do i oppose some of their actions? no.
512,notsarc,"you didn't prove anything. you just explained why it could be false or said it didn't matter. emoticonxrolleyes  'we've seen all of those things, and guess what, they weren't exactly as claimed. it was another american deception. another lie exposed.' how do you mean? i'm not aware of any deceptions thus far."
513,notsarc,separate but equal is never equal? which are better? boys' or girls' bathrooms? other than that last statement i agree 100%. i don't believe gay civil unions are separate but equal but i do believe they could be if we wanted them to be. unfortunately the people who seem to only be against redefining marriage and for civil unions never want to give gays all the rights of marriage in a civil union.
514,notsarc,"studies about what? that some people are more talented than others?  i'm afraid that falls under the umbrella of 'common knowledge'. so? it would change nothing, since i was pointing out why i responded the way i did."
515,notsarc,"another opinion- the sugar jar does symbolize the fetus, and the sugar the mental awareness. but just like people value their fine china. why is it that they cannot value something that is more valuable?! that is my point. another thing is this. why is it that you speak of a fetus that will never have mental awareness?! how would you know if you kill if before it can even develop mental awareness?!  also, i never said that i do not value someone who is not able to move. or think. where did you get that from?!"
516,notsarc,"is the legal aspect of it disputed or only whether it is immoral? i may be tooting my own horn, but this thread discussed the moral aspects of abortion in general, and this was my contribution. is that sort of what you're looking for?"
517,notsarc,"ya know what? this has inspired me to make a thread, hold on a sec."
518,notsarc,no one doubts the adjective sense of the word ;) and what is special about the human aspect? that was my question.
519,notsarc,"truth can be found in god. we as humans have a relative idea of what truth is because everyone will not agree on what is truth and what is not. for instance, one might say that europe will regain world power or that america will remain the world power but if everyone doesn't believe it how true is it? but universal truth can be considered aboslute such as math. 1 + 1 is 2, 12 inches equal a foot, etc. the question will remain to be unanswered until god reveals what truth is."
520,notsarc,"have you ever considered the possibility that he cares about you? that he knows you? and that he cares about those in the womb? this is always the charge hurled at me but it is never founded. you cannot find any misogyny in my writings but rather a great respect for women and their value and dignity. this is why i argue so strongly against abortion. yet, any oppression, or insecurity, or hardship, or difficulty they face, though real and challenging, is not justified in the face of destroying the life in the womb. though abortion reigns freely and forcefully and abundantly still the oppression and abuse of women endure. one reason they endure is that people are looking in the wrong place for a solution--they are looking to abortion when it offers no solution."
521,notsarc,the simple and most usual one would be bluntly that marriage is and always has been between members of the opposite sex. there may possibly have been some strange aberrations in the past but essentially that has always been the bottom line even for homosexuals. in addition to those there will be those who oppose it on religious grounds. and why shouldn't they if they so wish ? marriage is an institution not a right. if you don't qualify then you don't enter. by all means campaign to have the rules changed but don't be surprised if they aren't.
522,notsarc,"this assumes brain-dead is a logical choice to consider one dead. even so, it proves nothing about when life begins. what says they have to be the same? this is a classic example of a conclusion not following from the premise.  yeah, that is correct."
523,notsarc,"this an example of what i am saying you choose to ignore the moral command from the ot to burn witches whereas in the middle ages that moral command was followed this passage also mentions that you must pay taxes as well, are you rebelling against god if you complain about the redistribution of wealth through taxation if it set by the governing authority ? i also believe that passage can cause all sorts of problems, for example a fascist regime is a governing authority should you submit to a government that is morally unjust ?  bad in general, and no i don't think the same. as i said i have started to modify my socialist principles, i have a great sympathy for the anarchist way of thinking. where the state is a way to oppress the masses."
524,notsarc,"what is this fsm? if it follows what god says, then it would be a suitable compromize, but i've never heard of this fsm."
525,notsarc,"but that doesn't answer the question. why is dawkins a xxxxx to believe as he does? it seems that you have no answer except to throw out indiscriminate insults at people you know nothing about. in a previous post you stated, 'the guys a simpleton.' that doesn't make sense as there is no verb in the sentence. 'guys' is the plural of 'guy'. you don't seem to be aware that the contraction for 'guy is' is 'guy's.' your error is caused by ignorance whereas trebor's is clearly a typo caused by the proximity of the 'e' and 'd' keys. do you have a better explanation for our origins that doesn't involve magic and dirt?"
526,notsarc,"by 'church' ... do you mean the group of people who are christian (ie. congregation) ? the institution of church? to orthodox, the church is a living earthly embodiment of jesus christ. the role of orthodox is to be like god... by following his example. we are called to return to him, but we are separated from him by sin. we are living icons of god."
527,notsarc,"so now it is not about nuclear weapons ? first of all you need provide a direct link that the iranian government are directly funding terrorist groups, you need to make sure it is not a private citizen or a rogue element in the secret service.  the perfectly analogy is the ira, us citizens gave shed loads of money to the ira. how would you have reacted if the uk bombed the us because the actions of a tiny minority of us citizens ?"
528,notsarc,"do you know what a fatwa is ? the burden of proof is on those who want an invasion, iran can not prove that is not trying to develop a nuclear weapon. you can not prove a negative. honestly i don't think people have learned the lesson from the iraq war.  what did we hear before that invasion from the warmongers in the us and uk ?  the exact same thing we are hearing at the moment. that the regime is evil, they have wmd, they have links to aq etc surely the people are not dumb enough to fall for the same tripe again ?"
529,notsarc,what do you find disrespectful about it? maybe it is 'disrespectful' but i sometimes that's not necessarily so bad. i don't think it rises to the level of being offensive.
530,notsarc,"look, it's a serious disease. i've never denied it was. there's no need to pursue which disease is more serious than another disease. hiv/aids is a treatable, uncurable, and potentially deadly epidemic. i don't understand what you point or solution is. i support taking multi-faceted approaches, recognizing that people are different, how they live is different. you repeat some of what i said in regards to that, then assume i mentioned it because i don't think it's important. you had a few negative comments on condom use earlier, saying it is not 100% effective(no way of having sex with another person is). are you suggesting only one, narrow approach that involves moralizing? i believe that would drive sexual practices underground. i also support needle-exchange programs for drug addicts, as part of harm reduction, by the way."
531,notsarc,"is free speech applicable to under aged individuals under the tuteledge and care of educators entrusted with their welfare and behavior? if so, why? they don't pay taxes, the add nothing to the gdp. who cares what they have to say?"
532,notsarc,"huh? emoticonxconfused  i think that you meant to say that she can't take down a sign that isn't on school ground. in this situation, the sign was across the street from the school property."
533,notsarc,"islam is no more built on hate, burder and death than christianity is. do i have to remind you of the inquisition, the holy land wars, the witch burnings, etc.? if you try to claim that what some islamic people have done represents the whole religion, then i can do the same with those things that i listed, only for the christian faith. and don't even get started again on satan being a fallen angel - yes, we know about your beliefs that angels do not have free will, and yet rebelled against god, so we don't need to go into any more of that garbage."
534,notsarc,"what? you didn't know that religious people are the only ones that are supposed to be silent and never try to take part in democracy, while everyone else gets to do so? where have you been? emoticonxdonno  i wonder sometimes if opponents of religion really even stop to think about what they're really saying."
535,notsarc,what's your opinion of religious people who believe evolution is merely a part of creation?  there are non-literal creationists out there in large numbers.
536,notsarc,"see there is such a thing as heterosexual privledge. some heterosexuals will do anything, or say anything to protect this privledge. for the christianist it is all about control, and money. the christianist will say anything or do anything to maintian their money and control. take own own archangel, for example, in everyone of his posts he extols his religious beliefs and his belief that everyone should be both hetero and his brand of christian. one must ask themselves; why does he peach against something that does not personally effect his life? i have come to the conclusion that he is afraid that he will loose his heterosexual privledge and his control as a christian."
537,notsarc,"it's already illegal to employ illegal aliens, so rather then create a fine structure i would guess you would want to increase it, or add on some jail time? right now the punishment for hiring illegals is clearly worth the risk. how do you propose renters make sure that their prospective tenants aren't illegal aliens? you can't expect everyone to lay their hands on their birth certificates, you can't ask for social security cards, and most other id's are sadly easy to get ahold of, not to mention not really proving citizenship. how do renters make sure that they only rent to those they're supposed to?"
538,notsarc,"get real! all christians are being painted with a broad brush of prejudice from the left. there are over what a billion christians in the world? how many are pedophile priests? how many protest funerals?  sorry, bad editing job on my part. i rewrote it for clarity and left out an important part. emoticonxbanghead i meant that 'islam', the religion that flogs or kills homosexuals, is given a pass from the left. i don't hear the left crying about the injustices towards gays by islam. instead, the left is obsessed with bashing christians, which are, for the most part 1million times more tolerant than muslims towards gays.  see correction above. don't ever get old, it screws with your mind. ;)"
539,notsarc,"no, i completely agree. it's frustrating from a woman's point of view also. does this mean that if a father and mother take their child out somewhere, it's solely the woman's responsibility to take care of the child? things should definitely be levelled when it comes to parenting."
540,notsarc,does everyone who is in nambla identify as gay? i really don't know.
541,notsarc,"i've been following the story here all afternoon bbs. i'm sorry that you're going through this, but what has scotland done to upset radical islam ? nothing that i know of. could it be they have declared war on the west in general and as a whole ? i mean, i have been told over and over again how these radical moslems are just confused souls and the real enemies we must fear are the radical conservative christians like me who actually pray for the unsaved. talk about scary people, huh ?"
542,notsarc,"persecution on political grounds? we are talking about a kingpin of russian organized crime here. he has been indicted in russia for fraud and political corruption (bribing politicians) and there is absolutly no question that he is guilty as sin. now he is hiding in britain and actively planning a violent coup in order to overthrow the elected government...and he lays all this out to a british newspaper.  political persecution if he returns? probably not. execution for treason? that one seems more likely.  in the extradition rhetoric arena, the russians are looking a lot more reasonable then the british."
543,notsarc,"and a non-person is a non-person no matter how large it is! and i just say that it would be unjust and unfair of you to force metaphysical belief systems of your own which constitute religious belief upon your follows who may believe otherwise than you. get pregnant and treat your fetus as a full person if you wish, nobody will force you to abort it. let others follow their own beliefs differing or the same. otherwise you attempt to obtain justice by doing injustice.mo since you are not pro-choice what position are you to say what a pro-choice view is or would be? a consistent anti-choice view would be to force a rigid and unjustifiable moral code based on religious belief upon all women in a society. time after time such a concept has proven faulty. reply with quote"
544,notsarc,"please clarify what you're saying here as it makes no sense to me. what point are you trying to make ? off the top though, any comparison you make with being black and homosexuality is false because the bible doesn't condemn being black but it does condemn the homosexual act/lifestyle. and who does the anti-defamation league promote hating ? i am unaware of it if they do it."
545,notsarc,"my wife and i watch it faithfully, and there are very few shows that i make a point of watching. we've seen all of seasons 1 and 2 twice now. it really is an excellent program.  any word on season 3? i notice kevin mckidd (lucius vorenus) has his own show premiering on nbc in the fall. i'm not sure how he could film both shows at once, and rome wouldn't be the same without him. he and titus pullo make the show for me. i can't imagine what the show costs to produce per episode with all the sets, cameras, and wardrobe, but the visual presentation of the show is incredible. it brings ancient rome to life. i imagine the price tag is one of the main reasons there aren't more shows like it. waxy"
546,notsarc,mind if i ask if you drive yet? if so do you have any points on your license? 2mph seriously isn't a huge ammount and neither your speedo or the mobile cameras are usually calibrated to be that accurate.
547,notsarc,"does the enormous pay of ceos help the economy? probably not. would prohibiting enormous pay of ceos (threatening to fine or imprison people if they violated an arbitrary cap on salaries) help the economy? certainly not. is rawls argument correct, and all that remains is for us to work out the details of a totalitarian state to enforce his ideals? no."
548,notsarc,"is this a case of the truth hurting? then i guess it would work both ways. how do you feel about 'christians' slagging off non-believers, declaring that they will end up in hell for denying god? conceited? yup. could i give a toss? nope. how do you think non-believers feel about the smugness of christians? and it's not just me who thinks they're fairytales and that christians are delusional, as you well know. so why personalise it? apart from that, a lot of us here have a thick skin. this is a debating forum, and there is little room for those with delicate sensibilities who feel insulted at the pov of others."
549,notsarc,"well, signorile certainly didn't back up his opinions in this instance. how do you know it's the truth? if it were definitive, i'd be more inclined to agree. it's not 'common knowledge' that merv griffin was gay, at least not outside of hollywood. i'd never heard it myself. i don't see how you could know for certain anyone was gay that was in the closet unless they admitted to it or were seen doing something that made it clear they were (like having sex with someone of the same gender).  and the idea he should be hold some responsibility for not talking to reagan about aids in the 80s is absolutely opinion."
550,notsarc,"well, since we are talking about a gay man, i would guess it would most likely be masculine. yeah, you are being kinda homophobic. why would you possibly care if a gay man sees you in the shower? they're not going to do anything to you. if you treat someone differently for no reason other then the fact that they're gay, that's homophobia. gays are just like everyone else, excpect they're sexually attracted to the same gender. their interests cover the same spectrum as yours, sex aside. they are just as likely to be masculine or feminine as a straight man. gays are, in everyway outside of sexual preference, just like straights. so while you can certainly be selective about who your friends are, if you write someone off just for being gay that would be a shame, and a sign of prejudice."
551,notsarc,"you do realize i've provided you many links that explained it was not 'red, soft tissue' that was found, right? you remember this, don't you? and yet you keep peddling the same story every couple months. why is that? http://talkorigins.org/faqs/dinosaur/flesh.html so, again, it's not 'red soft tissue' that was found. it's the permineralized remnants of what seem to be osteocytes, blood cells, and blood vessels. not exactly the 'fresh meat' you seem to like to imply it is. the samples were soaked in acid to remove the minerals. exactly how 'red' and 'soft' was this tissue. keep going, you make yourself look more the fool everytime"
552,notsarc,"don't you all understand that another great evil has left the earth? i know steeeeve, and jyoshu that you would both celebrate the death of osama bin laden. why can you not understand then that to gay people these religious right evil freaks are equlivant to bin laden, especially this evil man, who is one of the promoters of the ex gay movement."
553,notsarc,it did not because it was not clear till the 1970s that horizontal gene transfer was something to be considered. nobody knew the mechanism till that era. and of course hgt is just another form of variability to be taken into account. genes transfered horizontally are as subject to selection as anyother form of gene. once intergrated into the recieving genome they are simply one more heritable element and if they alter the phenotypes (many are either neutral or even inactivatee) then of course they are subject to selection. why do you think otherwise? remember that horizontal transfer is a rare event roughly on a par with ordinary mutations.
554,notsarc,"so? anyone can be a victim of sociopaths, no matter what their version of the golden rule. making one vulnerable or not, it's still a 'nicer' form of the ethic. what makes 'social cohesion' is peoples' desire for self-preservation, not compassion for others. that's not the golden rule, it's just the understanding that people are better off if they get along with others. it's sort of like the 'mutually-assured-destruction' doctrine of the cold war."
555,notsarc,"well, the actual personality of the computer is in the hard drive. ram really isn't anything but a notebook, and the motherboard is more of a nervous system. so the processor and hardrive is the mind- the processor being the modivator, and the hard drive being the memory. if i were to take the intel p3 out and place an athlon xp 3000+ in it's place, would the computer be a different computer? no. it would be the same computer."
556,notsarc,"don't you see the foolishness of that based on your own personal life experiences as a sentient human being? no. you were the one who posted that something does not need to be sentient in order to be alive. why, then, do you distinguish between two things that are obviously both alive, both of which are parasites on their hosts?"
557,notsarc,"you really are an opinionated and arrogant chump. who said that the estimated age of the universe at 14 billion y.o. is a fact? it is a figure based on man's increasing knowledge and understanding. that the figure is adjusted from time to time shows that science does not rest. on the other hand, having faith that the bible is inspired, without testing it's veracity, and then basing your life on it, it absurd in the extreme. clearly you can't differentiate between the different meanings of the word 'faith'. swallow this:"
558,notsarc,"if they are used in reference to god, then how can you possibly say they don't refer to god??? jesus himself said he he and his father are one, in john 10:30. and the three appear together numerous times in parallel grammatical construction, denoting equality. it's a harder argument to make that the three are not god and that any one is lesser than the other in terms of divinity, than to say they are god."
559,notsarc,"i just don't see that being a huge factor. it might help some, but if my goal was to improve foreign relations reigning in spending would not be the first approach i would take. can you expand on your reasoning? the start of that chain is belligerence, not out of control spending. seems to me that if you want to control spending you should work on foreign relations. that way you get into fewer wars, and when you must fight you have others helping and sharing the cost."
560,notsarc,"did prohibition of alcohol do any good? nope, just made the criminals all the more powerful. did prohibition of drugs do any good? nope, just made the criminal all the more powerful. will prohibition of legal firearms do any good? not a chance in hell. banning legal ownership has never, ever, ever done anything toward ending the illegal use of something. never has, never will. it's absolutely impossible and just shows far for withdrawn people are from the real world in their thinking."
561,notsarc,"challenge god i'll accept. all the others are open to challenge, otherwise how do you explain: john wycliff martin luther thomas moore thomas cromwell oliver cromwell george fox john wesley charles darwin helda camara need any more? all believers, all christians in fact, all challenged one or more of your list. the history of the church is one of continual attempts to move closer to god, disrupted by human failings."
562,notsarc,"how so? one thing that determines if it's on the turf of science is whether or not it's even a 'proveable' matter to begin with at all. i doubt you'll find too many christians who would say you (or they) could measurably prove god, empirically."
563,notsarc,"obama is a fresh face and very appealing......but does he have what it takes when the next big foreign policy crisis hits? obama's remarks that he would sit down without any pre-conditions to meet with the likes of iran's president and the north korean tyrant is very naive. of course now he has chaned his tune a bit and talks about 'processes' before any meeting but it illustrates his lack of experience in foreign policy. as for the economy....change is needed but what kind of changes? it needs to be the right kind of changes, change for the sake of change will not fix any problems. besides obama has not said how he will pay for these changes when there is a big deficit. obama will be ready 8 years down the road but not now."
564,notsarc,"but jyoshu isn't saying that. jy's point seems to be that the fact something cannot be disproved somehow grants or lends it some kind of validity. with such a claim being equal across all religions, the criteria for determining said validity are obviously beyond the recognised standards of reason.  are all religions equally valid? they can't all be right. it seems from jy's posts (usually in discussions with lesz,) that jy thinks the only people who oppose christianity are atheists. there are, however, many, many more people who would argue that christianity is a crock, and they should actually represent a greater 'threat' to christianity, because the foundation for their beliefs is exactly the same as jy's. jy? ** sound of crickets chirping... **"
565,notsarc,"...well...in the last decade or so we've been starving them to death. where have you been? the arguments are very similar if you consider a fetus to be a human being. i'll grant you that. in the case of your c-section question, i think the mother should have the section, but we can never compell her to do so. it would be too dangerous a precedent to contemplate."
566,notsarc,"bass, what is the response in ny?  bad news for clinton as this was one of her endorsers. and a superdelegate. will she disavow the support of the gov as she asked obama? will she reject or merely renounce? this is not a private matter. what the executive of the state does in private opens him up to bribery and blackmail and compromises his integrity. if the man can break a vow he has made before god and his wife, how can the voters trust any promise he may make? he is toast."
567,notsarc,what would make e-mail any easier? both the forum and most e-mails have spell checks. wouldn't e-mail be harder to use since referencing specific paragraphs be really difficult? sounds like trying to organize it over e-mail would be a logistical nightmare.
568,notsarc,"best interests of the nation as opposed to what? other people outside it? i reject any notion that one nation should be promoted regardless of the effects on others. faithful to what exactly? if an oath makes you do something you wouldn't otherwise do, it makes you a slave. if it doesn't make you do anything you wouldn't otherwise do, it is pointless anyway."
569,notsarc,"isly, where are those who hate all christians that are members of congregations led by those radical preachers that abhor homosexualality?  where are all those puported 'christians' who have been misled by radical preachers into hating homosexuals? the country has far more to fear from them than it does from a black preacher who dares to speak truth to power."
570,notsarc,"our american cousins might not be able to hear the good archbishop as the bbc usually don't allow people outwith uk to listen again.  the way i see it is we have minimum wage, why can't we have a maximum wage? some of money that company directors get is absolutely obscene. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3243290.stm event when they fail they get a nice golden hand shake, in no other job would you get a big pay off for failure. also no matter way you spin it is so obvious that jesus was a hippy communist anarchist leftist. :)  http://www.gnosticliberationfront.co...irty_hippy.htm http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_communism"
571,notsarc,"i'm presuming, however, that each of my three translations listed above were written with referrals 'back to the original'. so which of the three do we decide to use over any other? i'm simply trying to show that major contextual differences can be, and often are, lost in translation. so how do you know which of the many different versions upon which to base your faith?"
572,notsarc,"why do you assume the poster didn't use birth control? they said nothing about birth control; only a statement on being pregnant and having an abortion. also, why do you make any assumptions about suffering? according to the poster, suffering was avoided. condoms are not 100% effective. a childhood friend's younger sibling was the product of a failed condom, among other factors. nine months and nine weeks are completely different."
573,notsarc,"i am familiar with both men; and my posts sound very lockean, which if you really knew locke you would know is true. remember previously in this thread (that is, when you were travelling these parts as 'bhbcu64') where i said that there is no right to control one's body? or where i said there is no right to suicide? that is locke 101."
574,notsarc,"what does that have to do with the issue being discussed? unless you're suggesting that for gays to refer to themselves as ethmi did is an expression of self loathing. is that the point you're trying to make? beside, by presenting a film with dick gephart and gene robinson as examples of god fearing christians, you immediately expose yourself as someone who has no concept of what a true believer in christ is. so why should a film that is nothing more than secular humanist propaganda be taken seriously at all?"
575,notsarc,"so the shrub and his cabal are not in any way responsible for our economic collapse? got it! the $12b a month the shrub and his minions are sucking out of the economy to pursue boy george's mad oil war in the desert had no effect on the overall economy whatsoever. fantasy island stuff! i can just imagine what you would say if a democrat were in the white house. i suppose that you do not hold president-to-be obama responsible for reverend wright's words, correct? and yes, if i fail to secure my home from break-ins and a tragedy occurs, i am at least partially responsible. will you baruch korffs (look it up!) ever take responsibility for the mess you have created?"
576,notsarc,"why not? it's a complete living human organism; any distinctions are aribitrary opinions, not biological facts."
577,notsarc,"so, what if 'times change' to where people no longer want to give human rights to everyone? what if 'times change' to where freedom of speech is no longer valued? that's the problem with a constitutional interpretation that doesn't include originalism; times do change, but i would hope of all things, valuing the principles of the constitution doesn't. it seems to me the more important aspect of the constitution is for it to be solid in changing times, not for it to change with them."
578,notsarc,is there a chance for the condemned to escape jail? yes! is there a chance for him to be beneficial to society? no! he's locked up! is there a chance for him to waste taxpayer money? of course he certainly doesn't pay for himself! does he deserve to live? well his victims did but they're kind of dead! is his death going to impact society more than him living? no! is him living going to impact society? yes he wastes tax money that could be going to actually help people! i like it! emoticonxagree
579,notsarc,"based on what? i never said mr. horn did anything legally wrong. he was well within the rights of the state of texas. i never argued otherwise. that doesn't change the obvious fact that he intended to kill the two men, which is the topic of the discussion at hand."
580,notsarc,"this is getting mighty old trebor.  i'll take that last post as a tacit admission that you had, indeed, invented budge as a source. the question then becomes, where did you get these ideas from first time around, and why aren't you sharing them with us? why did you feel compelled to fib? this photo brings up a bunch of other questions. on what website did you just find that picture? how and why are you interpreting it as it you are?"
581,notsarc,"how did you overcome all the similiarities? nothing was ripped and i stated your question and my response. originally i could have made it clearer, but you could have also used the scroll bar. responses to specifics within a post dont carry forward. you would have to be willing to accept that proof. if your not then it isn't possible to prove it to your satisfaction is it. read the source i posted earlier. maybe we should let the church go back to allowing only priests to have bibles and if that doesn't work kill some skeptics.  i don't suppose jews, hindus, muslims and bhuddists qualify as non-believers or were you being area specific?"
582,notsarc,so? the assertion was 'evolution is based on evidence - what do you have' suggesting that one side has 'evidence' and the other none. i am simply 'balancing' it out by showing that the assertion isn't black vs white as made out.
583,notsarc,"so, have you changed your position that religion should be outlawed? actually, if there is a god and he really is god, how would that not essentially be the case? if god knowingly 'lets' someone get cancer, i don't really see how that's any different (ethically speaking) that saying he gives it to them. there's no way for a deeply religious person to view this event any other way than god having a reason for it happening."
584,notsarc,"there is one major difference between the democratic spending plans and the republican plan (for this election cycle anyway): dems want to repeal the tax cuts, so they have a methodology for paying for all of this. oh, and they haven't been too keen on sending men to mars either. and just a quick aside, was it legal to invade iraq? probably, b/c of the legislation broker cites. but i think he makes a logical leap when he extrapolates 'justified' from 'legal.' the calculus used to say this was a 'just' war is a very dangerous one, and if cross-applied could justify innumerable conflicts (how many nations can legitmately say that another nation has 'dangerous activities' that make it pose an 'imminent threat'? at the very least, the entire mid-east (arab/israel) would explode under that logic)."
585,notsarc,"that seems to beg the question. be convinced one way or the other as much as you like, but if you can't prove your position, or even provide evidence for it, then how can you possibly use it to justify anything? yes, people's religious beliefs influence them. what shooter seems to be asking is if that's in any way reasonable? if you're basing your entire life on some point, should you be able to show that your beliefs about that point are true? put another way, it's kinda dumb to base major life decisions on a feeling, isn't it?"
586,notsarc,"what is not only illogical but patently false is the assertion that the unborn baby is making his mother a slave of any kind. did that baby force her to conceive it? is that baby the equivalent of a tumor as the pro abortionists claim them to be? no, it is an unborn human being who just needs the time to grow and develop in order to be a sentient being just as we are as we type on these keyboards.  that explains everything about how irrational you are! but based on your posts though, i think they already pulled the plug. emoticonxfrazzledemoticonxdonno  "
587,notsarc,did you know that one in ten british mothers suffer with post-natal depression? whereas: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4379422.stm it would seem that professionals are dubious about post-abortion depression. 'it showed that the women who opted for a termination reported less depression than those who chose to carry on with the unwanted pregnancy.'
588,notsarc,"do you realize, that the fetus has only recently not been defined as a human being. back when birth control first came out, planed parenthood wanted to make sure it would be leagle. so they redefined 'life' to say that you had to draw breth. by the way have you ever seen any pictures of the aborted babies? 'cause they sure like humans to me. you know most of them can already move before the abotion? look into the court hearings of judge ricard c. caey in new york. if you want to know the truth about abortion."
589,notsarc,"really? the transcript shows that he did not ask her anything in the gay marriage section of the discussion. transcript can be found here: http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/pr...al-debate.html and here: http://www.cnn.com/2008/politics/10/...ipt/index.html (click on the same-sex benefits section and the transcript shows up right next to the video) o rly?  not sure what you were watching, but it seems it wasn't the actual debate. i agree that she doesn't support gay marriage (but then biden and obama do not either), but she and biden/obama agree on civil rights for gays (visitation, contracts, etc.). just because you don't like the lady doesn't mean you should tell untruths about her (makes you look like archie)"
590,notsarc,what? i assume one is within one rights to be anti-gun. that's all.
591,notsarc,"is this in response to isly's out of context quote? he didn't even quote it correctly. it actually starts 'to avoid being mistaken for a sellout,i chose my friends carefully.' it's amazing how many people are throwing that quote, and isly's misquote, around in attempt to 'prove' that obama is a scary leftist radical. ooh, a college kid cultivating an image! what bizarre behavior, that'll come back to haunt him! :) first clinton, now obama. this is just the standard conservative smear job on the democrat-du-jour, taking out of context quotes and blowing them up to try to make someone they don't like look liberal. *shudder*"
592,notsarc,"can you support this moronic statement? the answer is obviously no. also, why should obama be less responsible for his own words on guns and religion than palin is for the words of her audience? the media will follow palin through the gates of hell and beyond to find something to demonize her. what lengths won't they take to attack republicans?"
593,notsarc,"true dat. sundowner, have you seen the life of david gale? if not, i suggest you watch it; it might change your view."
594,notsarc,were they assigned the ultimate task of interpreting the constitution and determining which laws violate it? if not then their opinion doesn't matter.
595,notsarc,will you explain and cite references on how that will happen due to their plans? another difference that obviouschild pointed out in another topic is that mccain's plan will add another 5 trillion to our national debt whereas obama's will add 3.5 trillion.  deficit increases - will mccain's or obama's tax cuts increase the national deficit more? factcheck.org: a new stitch in a bad pattern
596,notsarc,would you cite the exact article for once in your life? i'm sick of seeing the main page day after day after day.
597,notsarc,"any evidence for said 'abandonment'? also, the thing most likely to secure a lasting peace in israel-palestine is for the us to stop subsidising the oppression of the palestinian people. in any case, i thought we were talking about abm systems, i'm not aware of israel having such a system."
598,notsarc,"since when has a prescription stopped people from getting the drug? if they want it bad enough to steal it, nothing will stop them."
599,notsarc,"i keep thinking the same thing. the only conclusions i can come up with is that either the criminals are robbing people they have good reason to believe are unarmed, or that there haven't been enough deaths to violent home intruders to let them know that they're facing a serious health crisis. he didn't get shot the first time, he likely believed that she wasn't armed and wouldn't be able to resist any better than the last time; especially since he cut her power off the second time. interesting angle. i like it. we've got suicide by cop, why not suicide by victim? i sure thing he did, and i don't feel sorry for him."
600,notsarc,"ok, great so far. we're getting some good predictions on both sides. i think this is going to be a lot of fun to look back at in time. keep it up. more topics... cap and trade. will strict controls be placed? what effects if so? iraq. will he pull out? what happens then? (with iraq or terror here or whatever) how much $$$ will he throw at the economic crisis? what will the outcome be? anything you all want to predict or comment on concerning the upcoming presidency will be appreciated. have fun!"
601,notsarc,"but, as has been pointed out, your supplied definition of agnostic was incomplete. agreed. on what basis do you think that dictionary writers do come up with definitions? no - you chose part of a definition. i chose to add to it with other cited definitions and this led to our disagreement. in your opinion, i am not an atheist. but your opinion disagrees with a complete definition of the term 'atheist'."
602,notsarc,"which one is this brady? the discredited kellerman study by the discredited kellerman? or the opinion piece of the rabidly anti-gun brady campaign? cite your sources. and answer the damn question already. is self-defense with a firearm an immoral act? it's not rocket science, there's only two answers; yes or no."
603,notsarc,"okay, i think i understand a little bit more, so relative time started then right? strawman? i didn't even try to refute you; i explained what i thought you to say, noting it was different than what freedom said (though i still don't know if both of you agree on it) and asked a question about it."
604,notsarc,"so you have no idea if any states removed interracial marriage laws without court involvement?  and i'll just answer your question then which was (as you restated) [does] anybody kn[o]w of a state that had removed interracial marriage laws without court involvement. that answer is, yes, i know of a state that hard removed interracial marriage laws without court involvement.  glad i could help."
605,notsarc,"so, who's to say we're not philosophers? that's the second time i've seen you back out of a debate. i think these questions are importnat, i also think you can live a life with these questions and enjoy life to the fullest as well. in fact, i think you are missing a facet of life by not asking these questions. isn't the whole agnostic theory to ask questions, to seek the answer that is most likely not there? i think you are disillusioned.  were you raised agnostic? if not obviously you had to ask some questions to get there. anyway, mystery makes life interesting. i think life would be a waste without mystery."
606,notsarc,"i assume you take the position life begins at conception and biological potential is sufficient to claim to be a human. then why do we stop at a fertilized egg? if you mean potential, is supposed to become, or posses the correct dna to one day be then birth control would fit under birth control as would masturbation for you abortion is the immoral act of killing a human being. if we say based on results then killing is killing. the reasons are irrelevant, there is no difference between abortion, capital punishment or self defense.  yes these are extreme, but its where your position leads. at some point we make a choice and say that goes to far, but then we are back at choice and what is to much for one and not enough for another."
607,notsarc,i see alot of links to videos on this thread? but here's one that grabs my attention. i'm sure that this will shed some light on the issue.
608,notsarc,"what?!?!? you mean we just didn't take all of the oil we wanted in repayment for the money we spent defending iraq? i mean, as an imperialist superpower who allegedly imposes our will on the world, how come we didn't just take what we want or demand the deal we feel we deserve? i thought we invaded just for the oil? if so, why haven't we written the deal we wanted when it was us who set up the government which exists today?  you are so clueless as you attempt to demonize the usa, you can't even be consistent as you inadvertently admit that we have set up a fair and impartial system there which protects the iraqi's oil profits for the iraqi people themselves. but at least you're consistent in the hypocrisy and double standards which you represent. emoticonxdonno"
609,notsarc,"arafat is not a worse leader than sharon... arafat steals millions in aid money that is suppose to go to the palestinians, which 80% of them are below the poverty line. arafat advocates people to xxxx themselves up so that they may kill as many jews as possible. he is the head-figure of many of these terrorist groups and pours millions of aid into them.  sharon is worse? not only has arafat contributed to many more than 1,000 israeli casualties, his 'intifada' has continued the cycle of violence and thus caused the death of more than 2,000 palestinians."
610,notsarc,"notice how not one of your examples involves guns properly secured as i have suggested? even the gunshops had nothing more than glass between the thieves and the weapons. shameful. 'cleveland police commander wayne drummond had his city-issued 9 mm glock, fully-loaded clips, mace and police baton stolen last week when teens broke into his house in the city's southeast side when he wasn't home.' 'the glock 17 was stolen in january from lt. teresa brown, who is serving a 30-day suspension for being careless with her firearm.' 'thieves broke in through a small side window in the back of the business, in an area the gun shop owner rents to a dog groomer, the chief said.'"
611,notsarc,"how do you explain your position, on this thread, that torture is always wrong, and the americans are so f'ed up for torturing -- when you supported a military dictatorship that tortured hundreds of thousands of your fellow citizens, and in a manner that was far more brutal than what you refer to, for the u.s.? note; i've already stated my opposition to torture in any form. this is about you and your severe doublestandardistis, winston_smith."
612,notsarc,"i never said energy is going to cease to exist. if energy stops transferring, it still exists, its just not doing anything is the 'life force' energy? thats the question. from a physics perspective, can life be measured in joules? lol quantitatively, can one person have more life force than another? can you lose, gain or recharge your life force? like video game characters... is life itself physically definable? yes it exists, but can it be defined as a tangable entity or describable by physics?"
613,notsarc,"well, i agree with you. the federal government had a legitimate reason to regulate these items because it was hurting the economy, well being of people, etc i could go on. there is nothing in the constitution that says the feds can't. gay marriage and abortion are on a different level because they involve the rights of individuals as such enacting laws against them would be imho unconstitutional. also where is the proof gay marriage and abortion are degrading society? as far as i can think of there is no legitimate reason to regulate."
614,notsarc,"i am quite the anti-hypocrisy advocate. as for my personal take, 17-year olds should not be taking pictures like that. do you disagree? prejean should not have lied about it. anything beyond that is pointing out hypocrisy. seeing some of hilton's work, i don't see why he should be in a position to judge anybody. i think the 'adds a little flavor to a dull contest that no one cares about' is exactly why he was chosen."
615,notsarc,"another example is what percentage of the country would not vote for a 'qualified' representative of their political party, just cause he's an atheist... black president more likely than mormon or atheist that would be 53%. scribal terror: problematic question? http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/us/27atheist.html boy scouts of america precludes atheists from serving. discrimination against atheists: the facts"

617,notsarc,"now lets add one more wrench into the anti-gun works! when the american people read, 90% of weapons come from the u.s. they are led to think, bought in an american gun store.  something even sinjin apparently believes as well. however, doing some research, i found this april 19, 2005 report that tells how u.s. weapons can end up in mexico and be things that the citizen cannot buy in a gun store. why? because they came from the u.s. government, dea and the cia. military grade weapons. now how many can be traced back to legally purchased u.s. weapons?    central america: the farc, the contras and the flow of weapons  america! get the picture now?"
618,notsarc,"that speaks a lot about you and shows other posters they shouldn't take what you say at face value. yes it does. if i go before congress and say 'being gay is a choice without a doubt made at age 11' and had no evidence than i should be laughed at. same thing as this woman. she makes a claim with no evidence and reason to lie. this makes you not credible.  than a legislative body? while probably true, this is sad because newspapers have none."

620,notsarc,"if genesis in the bible is not a literal account of creation (i,e., six days, man from dust, fruit of good and evil) then what is its use? why include as the foundation of the entire bible a story that is either totally fabricated, or mostly inaccurate/metaphorical? genesis 1&2, in the literal application, has 2 vitally important concepts that the entire bible is totally useless without: 1. god is sovereign and totally limitless in power 2. man has disobeyed god and is in need of reconciliation everything else in the entire bible rests on these 2 premises. now if genesis has it wrong, then what is the use of any of the rest of the bible? from all scientific perspective, genesis 1&2 never happened, and here the validity of the entire bible is questioned."
621,notsarc,"which is pretty much normal for arch. do you think he realizes that many muslims in europe are cultural muslims? that many who emigrate to europe are quite disgusted with what they see back in their homelands? the rise of gay muslims in europe is quite interesting as to how they have fully adopted the views of their adopted european homeland and are afraid of returning to their original home countries. the notion that arch has that once a muslim always a crazy muslim is pretty nuts, but nothing but typical from a guy who thought that tv props are good evidence for 6,000 year old acts of creation."

625,notsarc,"'diversionary tactic'? the topic was 4 july and independence day. out of curiosity, did gw sign the declaration of independence? was he the first president? he didn't lead a bunch of rebels and militia? i never said you were a socialist, that you were educated in socialist schools. the result is evident. you don't have the fortitude to go to nara and read the truth in our history archives yet you snipe around trying to change the subject which is independence day. if it happened once before in can be repeated not only here but in other countries as well...and it is!"
626,notsarc,"now isn't that a terribly socialistic position to take? but, i'm confused by it at the same time, for socialists like you don't really want to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs now do you? emoticonxrolleyes when logic fails, there's alway ad hominem, right? and the ad hominen continues..... we're larger, more diverse, more litigious, need i go on? leaving the continued ad hominem aside, one of the causes for our high healthcare costs is litigation. since the dnc survives on the money derived from the blood-sucking trial lawyers lobby, i don't see real reform occurring until we cut those purse strings along with the big pharma's."
627,notsarc,"steeeve where are you getting this value angle from? people have a right to their lives regardless of the value of that life as determined by others. don't they? so, if a child is alive,.... no matter what stage of life, growth or development they are in,... they have a right to the life they are living. don't they? i don't get this 'value' angle. we have established that human beings have a right to their lives. a prebirth child is a human being so, a prebirth child should have a right to their life.  the life that they are already living. simple as that."
628,notsarc,"do you mean when pelosi said the protestors had nazi banners, when they were actually banners saying 'no' to nazism? she's in the democrats. you mean the fantasy land whitehouse version of the proposals, that no one has actually read? no one that understands the constitution would say that, that's a very ignorant comment. what's perverted is that you think freedom of speech means the people have to shut up while they listen patiently to the government propaganda machine."
629,notsarc,"that's pretty much assumed that god is magic. hence why we laugh at it when it is presented as a viable alternative to testable fact.  what is more interesting is that archie who believed unless i'm mistaken that his god is perfect, is in fact a huge liar.  btw, did you read the link i posted? it took 20 pages before a creationist took a stab at the arguments. archie didn't even try."

632,notsarc,"morals are what you make them to be. for example, 'it's ok to kill youths if they've insulted your prophets' is another possible one. the ones in my joshua example? he doesn't tell them, nor did i say that he told them. look at what i said: 'the morality of the old testament peoples (god included) is definitely questionable.'. however, in the next chapter he does immediately reward them, by protecting them from the angry reprisals of the neighbouring villages: '5 then they set out, and the terror of god fell upon the towns all around them so that no one pursued them.' note that in the other examples, god is either commanding it (through the proxy of a speaker) or directly doing it (pillar of salt, bears etc)."

635,notsarc,"there's a fair few problems with this. off the top of my head... what happens when the pregnancy is accidental, and neither the mother nor the father want a child? what consequences would there be for a mother who didn't want to give the name of the father? would there be any? why is only the father punished? having consensual sex is just that - consensual on the part of both people. if it isn't consensual, rape laws already cover it and if it is consensual and a pregnancy occurs, why punish only one of the consenting individuals? on a more fundamental level: what evidence do you have that having an abortion is 'a mortal sin'? why should the courts be concerned with preventing a religious concept?"
636,notsarc,"proving my beliefs from the bible is not being un-christian. is it? as i said i don't want to debate it with you, i just like to know who i'm typing to. simple."
637,notsarc,"no definite proof? so then you have nothing to justifiably base your fears on. yours is basically no more real than a child's fear of shadows. you're admitting that you're letting your own paranoia control your thought process on this one. others have said it before, i believe it still applies; you're sick with mental illness. seek psychiatric help to deal with your unreasonable and baseless fears. if the psychiatrist can't help you, there's always drugs and electroshock therapy."
638,notsarc,"i'm not saying most species aren't gay, i'm saying most don't have free will... more the question is, how differently do they have to be affected to generate different sexual preferences? maybe even only slight differences can create gayness. i don't think it's a simple choice like that, 'gay or straight'"
639,notsarc,"whether there's liberal parties in other countries is beside the point. there is no national 'liberal party' in the usa. if nato was suggesting the ny one, i hardly can be held responsible for not knowing 'their message'. i couldn't care less what it might be.  she said as much. let's see what happens next, shall we? i have a feeling she'll be amending the policy shortly."
640,notsarc,"hold on there. have you read the amendment? if all of our legistlators passed laws based on single incidents, our nanny government would be exponentially more intrusive than it already is.  now i don't know this woman's story any more than you do. all you know is that at least one defense contractor has a clause in it's employee contract banning an employee from shoooting for the brass ring in a jury trial. it doesn't state that the rapists can't be prosecuted."
641,notsarc,"the (us) government is not required to 'recognize' all forms of unions or so called marriages,... just because it has the authority and the responsiblity to define and recognize one.  either the government has discretion or it doesn't; and at least according to article 1, section 8.... it does. if a county clerk operates outside the law,... that can not negate the law she has ignored or circumvented. if a licence branch clerk started passing out drivers licenses to illegals and other 'non qualified' applicants,... would the government in that case be required to validate and 'protect' those illegally gotten certificates? you should know better than that.  emoticonxdonno"
642,notsarc,"i have heard that you can easily find a marriage license copy online and without having to pay a fee. is this true? i would love to get a copy of my deceased parents' marriage license if i can. it would be a nice thing to frame and to keep on the wall to remember them by. so, can you find copies of marriage licenses online or is this just an urban myth?"
643,notsarc,"you have a specious arguement at best probably caused by not being educated enough on the subject. you are just as dead or wounded no matter if the firearm is a modern high powered rifle or a flintlock smooth bore musket. it is not the tool that does the damage. its the hand that wields it. the major problem with your argument is when is enough, enough? for the controller regulator the answer is never until you have a uk or japan. when a right is controlled or regulated it is no longer a right. it has become a privilige subject to the whim of petty bureaucrats.

644,notsarc,"and how does this differ from life insurance or car insurance? or for credit cards, for that matter? the cost of a policy, or card, is proportional to the risk assumed by the insurer. don't want to pay high premiums, take the risk on yourself. period. i find it morally unacceptable to steal money from people in order to satiate another's morality. we have no god-given right to live forever as far as i know."
645,notsarc,"you didn't any of the questions, you coward.  1. if i am fired for being gay (perfectly legal is most places in the us), is that 'dissapproval of another human beings behavior' [sic]? this happens all the time, not for imcompentence. it is legal to fire someone solely for being gay. what behavior is being disapproved of? 2. how is 'being' gay a behavior? i am just sitting here in my pajamas being gay. what behavior am i exhibiting that warrants your disapproval? ps. bonus question: what is a gay activist?"
646,notsarc,no i sure don't need to. i made an observation that gun free zones don't work verstanden sie? you need to prove they do if you don't agree. the shooter sure knew there wouldn't be any firearms around from his military experience. it is quite evident to anyone with an iq above room temp who he bore a grudge against. try again slim.

653,notsarc,"what makes you think they're not true? jesus arose from the dead. that's one of the most well attested to facts in ancient history, whether you want to casually sweep it under the rug or not.  many skeptics set out to prove the story of christ to be a fairy tale. none succeeded and a number became believers. you guys are playing with absolute fire. if you're wrong (and you are), you're screwed big time. big time and forever. do you feel lucky? well, do you?"
654,notsarc,"falling, did i say that 'the church alone provides for the needy?' if i did please point it out to me. each religion has its own place to turn, but none of them should ever be able to turn to the federal government. the constitution gives certain delegated powers to the federal government and handing money out for educational purposes is not one of them. socialism is merely the stepping stone into communism, and i don't want to see this nation start down that path. maybe i live by the constitution because it is 'the supreme law of the land.' the question is not why do i live by the constitution, but why don't you? until the constitution is replaced it will govern this land, and i plan to live by it."
655,notsarc,which ones and how so? i am curious because your saying using the same reasoning different conclusions are reached. maybe the reasoning is not the same
656,notsarc,"are you sure you mean burqas? burqas are generally found in afghan culture, if your local muslims are from the middle east, chances are they're wearing jilbab and niqab rather than burqa, particularly if it is black. also, you've pulled that xxxx with the largest population of muslims outside the middle east before, and it's simply untrue."

664,notsarc,so if the miller case supported your claim about what types of guns a person can own. why can a person still own sawed off shotguns? the miller case did say sawed off shotguns are not military eguipment.

670,notsarc,"if you check again you will find they do have self defense shootings in the list as well as accidents. the point is, as even you have now pointed out, the number is flawed. the source, vpc, knowingly used false data to further their claim. therefore eliminating any validity to their claim.  you and brady continue to trot out biased and inaccurate sources to back your arguement. you should stop, it does great harm to your credibility. wow, you really can leap tall mounds of logic in a single bound. what evidence do you have that any of these deaths would have been prevented by banning concealed carry? then also consider the lives saved by concealed carry, such as mine."
671,notsarc,"ooo, the slippery slope argument! always a classic. the right to not be discriminated against based on her sexual orientation perhaps? what part of the dress code was she going to violate? she was going to wear formal wear. it's not like she was going to show up in ripped jeans and a slipknot t-shirt. rules designed to exclude her. their wishes don't supersede her rights."

'now the nra are the big defenders of the second amendment of the constitution, the right to bear arms. but yet they think it's all right to throw everybody else under the table so they can get a special deal, while requiring everyone else to comply with all the rules outlined in this bill, and frankly, i think it's disappointing.' - house minority leader john boehner (republican-ohio), june 24, 2010"
677,notsarc,show them what? all i said is that the logic in what i quoted is flawed.

You are more than welcome to that approach to things.

689,sarc,"EZ. That is not what I said.I would think a Bible website would be good for biblical information, but for archaeological information? not so much.If you want to provide archaeological evidence of the Exodus, why don't you seek out information from an archaeology sources? Please answer this.If I wanted to seek archaeological evidence to confirm something that happened to a people that was written about in their ancient writings, I wouldn't seek a specialist in the ancient writings as a resource, I would seek an archaeology expert.

690,sarc,I am not making a mockery of the second ammendment (and so what if I am. Isn't free speech on the first ammendment?). I am actually asking a legitimate question and have yet to have it answered. WHERE DO WE DRAW THE LINE? The second ammendment sheds no light on this. If I was mocking anything it was that you were dodging the question because you want to say no limits although in face of something so obvious you are embarrassed at such a statement.
691,sarc,"Let's answer the first bit that you clearly don't understand.I agree that it is a hypothetical question (I'm sure we all do), but it has everything to do with RELATIVITY. Did you get it this time?As for gravity having an effect on the speed of light, I'm sure you're just grasping for something to cut and paste that has something vaguely to do with the point at hand, but you may have noticed that the initial query (the one about the car) does not mention gravity anywhere. As for you understanding the concept of gravity effecting the speed of light, can you explain why it has this effect? And try doing so without cutting and pasting someone else's words.And with regards to the last bit, you didn't grasp the very pointed reference to RELATIVITY (twice), so I very much doubt it.Smiley"
692,sarc,"Why not quote the Second verbatum and parse it? Of course you'll need to clarify that the commonly used rules regarding the English language and valid logic must apply. Otherwise, you'll get the liberal twist of subjective ""logic"" and interpretation of the author's intent."

694,sarc,Yep.We must obey the will of the people.The vote was totally fair!So...why are those who obviously voted for M.A. rioting?I guess they are like America.Vote for someone insane...and then riot about the results.
695,sarc,cant you read? if you are correct this actually supports my point.
696,sarc,you kind of made a good point here... both the government and the church have ulterrior motives for 'helping the poor': the politicians hope to gain votes and the church hopes to gain converts...both groups of suckers will be paying back for the rest of their lives in one way or another.  and the church collects more of 'it's own money' to purchase more poor sinners. both groups are indentured servants to their masters. what do you mean 'generous with your own money'? isn't that what the government is? perhaps the christians don't want to help all the poor - only those who belong to their church or those willing to sell their souls to it. both are doing a terrible job of 'helping the poor'.
697,sarc,i find it funny you think article v was repealed yet the bill of rights references article v for passage.  so we have the bill of rights which can't be repealed but article v which was repealed meaning all the amendments we had are unconstitutional? you've really lost it haven't you. what do you mean 'sos' by the way? save our ship haha? i have been saving your ship.

705,sarc,"i'll agree with you on some of the things you said, but not the hired gun. america doesn't need to hire guns, we have our own. if what you are asserting is the case, then why would we be where we are right now. and are you saying that israel gets there weapons for free? this is america son, nothing is free if you haven't found out. and our strong ties with israel are more than likely due to the fact that they're more trustworthy than any of the arab nations, thus making a greater ally."

707,sarc,too many other murders and too much info already out. i think they got a judge that has been using hope-ium? that may just highten the scope of the investigation and lead to impeachment.
708,sarc,'fast and furious' white house gun control - page 1 - chuck norris - townhall conservative chuck norris on gun smuggling administration. don't you gun grabbers feel bad to be yet again on the wrong side? that would be the criminal side...
709,sarc,1) why is the philosophy of jefferson twisted?? if you can't say its because you are a typical anti american liberal. 2) nothing to suppoprt it? if anti-american liberal positions were made illegal as per the constitution then everyone would have to vote among the conservatives.  the political spectrum would simple shift so that both extremes were in the intelligent range. on the far left you'd have romney and on the far right you'd have ron paul. now that would be an intelligent election consistent with our very very conservative constitution.
710,sarc,"his own drummer all right... you might say that the ot god has a bit of a problem upstairs...  funny you should mention lot's wife. lot's family are the sole survivors of the destruction of an entire city, for reasons which are debated. lot's wife is turned into a pillar of salt just because she looked backwards as she was leaving- a natural human response. gen. 19:26 clearly states that she was behind lot. therefore in order to find out what happened to his wife, wouldn't he also had to have looked back? so, anyway, turning around gets you turned into a pillar of salt, but incest is a ok! it must be scary believing in such an inconsistant and crazy god..."
711,sarc,why couldn't houdini just leave the occultists alone and stick to magic tricks? it's not hawking's job to make allowances for the possible benefits of snake oil.
712,sarc,"i don't see why not. if somebody is perfectly willing to murder you in cold blood despite your blind compliance i see no reason to believe that they'd hesitate if it meant crushing a skull with a bat rather than just shooting them in the face. seriously, what kind of stability are you dealing with when all it takes to motivate someone to murder is a simple question? a baseball bat isn't concealable like a handgun, is it? nor can it be readily used by someone suffering arthritis or used in a cramped location. any weapon can be used to inflict death and murder. the human body is hardly a modern marvel of resiliency and near-indestructibility. even sneezing wrong can be potentially fatal. certainly not. do you see a contradiction?"
713,sarc,"black unemployment is at 19 -20%. the economy is in the toilet, as are obama's approval ratings. and you're swilling kool aid and saying you know best? lol! that's why you liberals are dangerous. you're too steeped in folly to understand what's going on. how's that hope and change working out for you? emoticonxbouncer epicurus apparently never read the book of revelation where god levels the evildoers. and you look up to that? what's the matter with you? you didn't read it either to know epicurus is three sheets to the wind on that? that's why you liberals are dangerous."
714,sarc,"the truth hurts doesn't it? you say that 'it is part of the problem' then you claim it isn't illegal? dyslexic much? gun traces are for many reasons as bryan has fastidiously pointed out and seldom if ever useful for any prosecution.  now, who are we to believe joker? dangling participle and you claim to have an education? lol unsupported statement you snatched out of thin air. if you haven't noticed, we have history and the scotus on our side of this idiotic argument you keep trying to sell without success. thanks! for your edification, there are over 26 pages of documentation complete with links to reputable sources and to congress for your perusal. instead of reading them you ignore them, stuff your fingers in both ears, cover your eyes and act like a child."
715,sarc,"where did that happen, in your dreams? please note the word ' extreme'. extreme lefties have been just as blood thirsty as extreme righties."
716,sarc,"talking of spiritually deranged, have you looked in a mirror lately? you are the antithesis of jesus' message, with your vile hateful spewings. get thee behind us!"
717,sarc,"he also quoted liberally (get it) from the unabomber manifesto. norway suspect borrowed from unabomber's manifesto - yahoo! news so, the attacker is now linked with the university of berkeley??? if this keeps up i am sure we will find out it was all kevin bacon's fault..."
718,sarc,"that's it brady? that's your answer? i don't know, maybe the american people are buying that! emoticonxsmilie like i said, that is what they are after!!!"
719,sarc,"hey , i am the seed of the woman too. gosh, does that mean my birth was prophesied? not only that, i am the son of man too!."
720,sarc,ultimate purpose? do the doctors ask how many firearms and what type? serial numbers?  how can a yes answer to the question as to whether one keeps guns in the house result in anything 'akin to registration'?  nothing but paranoid delusions imo.
721,sarc,"you mean like northern illinois university or virginia tech? why....if they rescinded their complete ban on firearms on campus, someone could bring a firearm onto school property and shoot the place up! oh, wait........... yeah. seems like the complete ban on firearms is about as effective as it is in chicago or washington d.c. gun control laws: because someone who completely disregards the proscription against murdering innocent bystanders will, no doubt, altruistically agree to voluntarily disarm because it's against the rules."
722,sarc,"that i later 'concede' in a pm? you mean despite the fact that probably coming up on a dozen times now i have told you premises represent evidence and you decided that the last time i told you this was a concession.... what do you think a 'logical premise' is? show me denying that i said a. i'll be honest i have no way to prove otherwise because proof relies on logic. of course there is an objective truth here, i can illustrate the contradiction inherent in false logic using the real world; but if you don't accept that contradiction is unacceptable...."
723,sarc,"hey doofus, you made no effort to qualify if those people were licensed carriers or just had a gun in the house or vault at the bank. many probably are hunters or people like yourself that owns a 30-06 his mommie bought him :) you answered exactly how? i know because i saw your first 3 responses. do you drink a lot? ...and often? so far it looks like 40% of non gun owners do most of the drinking. that doesn't mean they aren't armed, they just deny having a gun. sloppy poll!"
724,sarc,"boy howdy, it is getting where you can't get a lie in sideways isn't it brady? emoticonxkill well, it's been real brady. come back if you can keep from stepping on your nose. :)"
725,sarc,"your name isn't on the 4473 form either is it scottie? tsk, tsk, tsk and your muther is the one that demanded that isn't she? guess it don't mean much to the elite eh scottie? i don't think you are in a position to demand anything scottie? emoticonxbouncer neither is your mother. emoticonxkill"
726,sarc,"sorry your mightiness, thank you for your graciousness of addressing us common folk.  are you really that obtuse? i swear you and easy share a brain. i clearly pointed out that this commandment talks about respect for authority. personally, i think this applies to single parents, families with 2 daddies, or children raised in an orphanage.  yet i bet somehow in the formative years of the children, they are taught some form of respect for authority.  how so? i didn't write it, i'm just commenting on it. and again, i prefer to replace 'mother and father' with authority. regardless, who says respect = fear? maybe you and easy really do share a brain...you both seem to think you can define words as you see fit to lend creedence to your arguments."
727,sarc,"i'm sorry; kalifornia?? this from a guy who lives in the people's republic of oregon. and yeeeesss, oregon has some big cities as well: i fly into portland several times a year."
728,sarc,"the 'city' huh? same one same all. we know who to sue for attempting to infringe on a fundamental right now don't we. who hired the investigators besides the mayor? nice try sparky. oooooh, kroll has deep pockets too. l00k at the board of directors and the usual suspects. misapplication of funds too huh?"
729,sarc,i doubt you know enough about carl bogus speedy defense of bellesiles and his dependance on a flawed study by loftin which was also in turn defended by jack rakov who later apologized out of embarrasment? want to take a shot and drag this farther off topic and embarrass yourself and star gazer and any other adherents? you well know you are in the wrong ballpark as has been pointed out many times on this very board. keep clutching at straws you will never get enough to build that strawman. beating a dead horse is bad enough...all 9 justices agreed the right was individual in heller.
730,sarc,me whine?  this entire f ing thread is devoted to you whining. go cry to your mommy about all those big bad gay people picking on you and your poor little religion.
731,sarc,it went way over your head accipiter didnt it? the world will always have it ...it is either real or part of the human psyche....
732,sarc,"uh huh. you prefer to be left alone so you can butcher all the unborn babies you want. besides engaging in infanticide, do you know what's wrong with your liberal mentality? you've slaughtered a whole generation of future scientists, teachers, and taxpayers - the latter in sufficient numbers that they would have been able to fund your invasive obamacare in its entirety, along with other nanny-state entitlement programs. turkeys. you losers ought to be caned and deported."
733,sarc,"i must admit i was a bit confused when you came out with this: where in this discussion did i offer any solution to zimmerman (i don't remember mentioning him at all)? nor did i give any suggestion as to what i would do. so where did this 'both of you' come from? please could you also point out where i interjected pepper spray into the debate? a quote would be nice. oh, and the term 'enemy combatants' was just made up so that the bush and his partners in crime could get round international law. the geneva convention does cover them very clearly in the quote i gave."
734,sarc,"still as whiney the pooh says... so what's the problem him buying a gun? he'll fry: good'nuff for'im. and if guilty, i will bring the rope and whiskey. also:whats up with this new format??:("
735,sarc,"that's one of the dumbest things i have ever heard. if these dummies don't have a problem with information increasing, but do have a problem with beneficial information increasing, don't you think there is a problem? you included. you don't have a problem with change, only good change bugs you. dumb!"
736,sarc,"yeah, ez is what will come back to haunt you. hay ez you know why i can say anything i want about jesus with out consequence? it's because jesus never existed. sleazy, when are you going to grow up?"
737,sarc,"like in afghanistan? hopefully it will go a little better with this puppet, his own bodyguard was the latest in a slew of assasination attempts."
738,sarc,"so atop a mountain of ignorance is where we will find religious people? yeah, sounds about right to me."
739,sarc,"spoken like someone truly out of touch with reality. how long has it been since you were in high school? because if it hadn't been so long you'd know that short of coming to school in a banana suit (maybe not even then), kids could give two sh*ts about what other kids are wearing."
740,sarc,"so the creationists among us seem to be saying that there is no proof for evolution, am i right? well, other than the facts of fossils, dna similarities, carbon dating of remains etc. maybe you have a point. but it seems to me that there is quite a bit less proof for the existence of god... hmm a book written by people 2000 years ago? well thats definitely fact, rather than a work of 'fiction'. and how long ago was the world really 'created', 20 million years or there abouts. what was happening in those years between then and the time of jesus? maybe god was asleep. if he does sleep... hmmmm or maybe, he doesnt exist.... but then again that just couldnt be true could it... emoticonxconfused"
741,sarc,"if reality conflicts with the bible, there are people that tend to 'reinterpret' the bible so that to them it agrees with reality. this is inexcusable in my opinion. to me, the very fact that they convince themselves that the bible says something it doesnt is worse than simply admitting that the bible contradicts reality. what is the point of depending on the bible for truth when youre going to interpret it to suit something entirely contrary? its like telling your kids that the moon is made of cheese, and then later when confronted with contradictory evidence, rather than admit you lied, you tell your kids that they misinterpreted what you said."
742,sarc,you know who else is not normal? one who has an i.q. of 122 or higher.
743,sarc,"but wouldnt it mean that if she (if phunting is female) burns in hell, that would mean that god really exists. do you believe in god? also, do you think that if god really does exists that he's just bluffing about that hell stuff? hmmmm..."
744,sarc,the liberal propoganda army is on the way? the man  must be lonesome!
745,sarc,she didn't have answers to about 12 questions...'i don't know. ' 'i wasn't informed of that'...talk about uninformed political hacks? we have 'leadership' emoticonxrolleyes that defines 'uninformed'.
746,sarc,god has emotions wow. that has got to be ridicules thing i heard in the old days you talked like that they would send you to a cuckoo farm. god loves you god hate s you etc etc etc. what a bunch of hog wash. what do people mean by that? you would think god sat down and had breakfast with you or something like that. emoticonxwow
747,sarc,"i'm having trouble following your line of thinking. could you please post in a common language, preferably english? i don't think anyone wants to ridicule you but if your posts are indecipherable you make discussion impossible."
748,sarc,"knowing more than just a little about my fte compadres, and those that i know personally, they would fight along beside me and i them to preserve our freedoms. to go as far to bow down? when they have taken what smidgen of life is left in me. but in direct answer to your post, jim: they are doing so as we speak."
749,sarc,"so, terral03, you just supposed i am an athiest? in fact i'm a white witch, if you must know. these are better than black witches (because they are white, and therefore superior). we have come to this realm to feed on the flesh of the innocent (and to point out contradiction in the bible.)  emoticonxclown"
750,sarc,"yeah, silly me for thinking that the english language came from england. gosh that's obviously because i didn't get all those 'a's at school. i am, it is. where is 'here'? we are online, there is no 'here'. and the 'modern english language'? i speak the modern english language, you speak the us version of the modern english language. personally i feel that the sign of true high iq is using your supposed score to boast about it on internet forums and ask for other peoples scores to 'make another mockey (sic) of' them."
751,sarc,you'd be hard-pressed to get me to agree with your definition of 'conservative' . and i'd love to tell them. do you have their e-mail addresses? i'll start with chickenshit kennedy.
752,sarc,"yeah your the other bright guy who keeps spouting off opinions but never states facts. the media constantly puts out reports against bush, not to mention any republican. do you remember the biggest joke in political history grey davis?? the media thought he was a god, even after we booted him the hell out. start giveing facts, i could really care less about your uneducated opinion"
753,sarc,"it must because he's a liberal. hey sarah, how come bushie's daddy, cheney, and rumsfeld all used to rub elbows with saddam? must be cause they were led astray by some liberal..."
754,sarc,of course you can pass that sort of opinion off and some people actuall believe it. how on earth it can be tested? i guess we're only going to respect the sweeping generalisation a typical atheist trick!
755,sarc,"that's certainly an issue in its own right, yes - but matthew's gaffe is suggestive of the kind of post-hoc jiggery-pokery that shaped the bible's contents. as far as fulfilling prophecy goes, is it really prophecy if someone knowingly sets out to make it come true? zechariah could have had the messiah turning up walking backwards eating a pork pie - so long as any would-be messiah knows what he has to do :) and when all's said and done, the new testament was written decades after the fact, with the old testament near at hand, a desire to spread christianity burning in the breast, and nobody to say these prophecies hadn't been fulfilled. i respect your decision to believe they were, but i don't see any objective reason to agree."
756,sarc,"a book is harassing you? emoticonxwow i'd get a court order taken out on it. but yes, of course it is subjective, however just because it is illegal to harass someone (or incitement of racial/religious hatred, which is also illegal) i would hardly say that consitutes the doom of freedom of speech. as a supreme court justice once said, 'freedom of speech does not include the right to shout fire!' in a crowded theater.'"
757,sarc,"so now name calling and accusations as to my mental health are what you concider as rational thought?  i expect that you must be some sort of expert on warfare, in paticular this war? am i to believe that you are a soldier there now?  your rage towards me in your post only shows just how easily upset you are. i posted exactly what i meant to and you went off on a tangent. i asked you for proof and all you can do is a schoolyard tactic if 'show me yours before i show mine?' pitiful."
758,sarc,"hmm..the root of the word global is 'globe' and the word 'globe' refers mainly to the earth, the world, the planet as a whole. how much more general can you get? i'd have to agree that this could quite possibly be the worst comment in the history of comments. maybe next time, kiddo."
759,sarc,"================================================== ====== ================================================== ====== ================================================== ====== ================================================== ====== so a river with a sandy bottom is not a river? so a human on steroids is not a human? so a sword tempered by heat is not a sword? i'm not following your definition, because you contradict yourself earlier. but then: is faith used in conjunction with reason somehow not faith used with reason? i realize you have to be illogical/irrational to argue your side, but i don't appreciate it. so, i was correct to reply: faith, belief without evidence, arrived at through reason, which by definition requires evidence.  inconsistent. so, go figure, i was correct all along and you just didn't know it. -mach"
760,sarc,"so, clive, everyone that believes that god created the earth is an idiot? you need to spend some quality time with some that do and i think you'd change your tune."
761,sarc,"what do you not understand about a republican 527 running a communist for kerry campagin? right....well, we know that iran expliciately endores bush....and lilkely the kkk as well. so... ball is in your court."
762,sarc,"shall we regress to babble?  the government is already heavily into the term 'marriage'. not only the us government, but governments all over the world refer to 'marriage' as the legal union of a man and a woman. changing the definition in one country would likely create confusion everywhere.  what if some countries required you to clarify whether you were married to a man or a woman in order to get a visa? do we need to define several types or classes of 'married couple'. what if some countries objecting to the concealment of the gender of one's spouse instituted a death penalty for it? i would argue that legally joined same-sex couples should have all the benefits and rights afforded married couples, but not for redefining 'marriage' solely for the purpose of calling them such."
763,sarc,"are you talking about the love of god or the love of the politically-correct? as the bible says, 'love does not rejoice in iniquity,' and, 'love does a neighbor no harm' (like enticing one's neighbor into a sinful, carnal relationship). trying to bring people to god's way of loving is a most unappreciated endeavor. so pedophilia and wife beating are okay with you? neither of those are in the ten commandments either. do you really think god approves of those?  but god is on record about gay sex. you might want to read leviticus 18:22, leviticus 20:13, romans 1:26-27 and jude 7 to become acquainted with god's admonitions against gay sex."
764,sarc,"lol lol lol you have denied repeatedly that it is a religious issue, and now you say it is a 'sin'. can't you make up your mind about anything? is gambling a sin? is drinking alchol a sin? is charging interest on a loan a sin? you seem to be very arbitrary in where you draw your lines regarding a lot of things. regardless, it simply is not a religious issue."
765,sarc,"yes. your point? have you? as poor a typist as i am, and as full of mis-spellings as most of my posts are that is the best you can do? i must be slipping."
766,sarc,"this particular one, formulated the way it is, might well fail. that's why i hope the stupid attorney stops where he is.  where do you get this bizarre idea that the court shies away from 'controversial' issues? ooooo... that's a persuasive legal argument. i'm impressed (not). gay people have been 'earning it' for over 100 years. in the short-term, we may suffer setbacks, in the long-term, there's no stopping us. another unsubstantiated pov that also happens to be untrue. no matter how many times the ditto-heads on the right say it, it remains a fact that the state supreme courts that have recognized the right of same-sex to marry have been dominated by moderate and conservative, republican-appointed judges. of course, they're part of the fading breed of conservatives... the ones who believe in individual rights and freedom."
767,sarc,"why do you describe them as 'obstructionist' scripts? if someone can't admit to making bad decisions 2 years ago, or at least admit they'd do things differently with what we know today, why should we assume they wouldn't make the same mistakes again?? in the real world, we use job interviews to probe for competence and ability, i guess you're just for hiring anyone that agrees with the boss."
768,sarc,and that makes it so? i've got this nice little 4-lane bridge over the trinity river that i can let you have cheap. dono
769,sarc,"gevorkian azat lol, do u think america wants their oil, yeah? omg, dont u be so naive, buddy. wanna know why america wants azerbajan? we want it for the future war against iran. didnt u know it? lol azerbajan is a very good place for our military bases. air bases and everything else of the kind. do u know how it is convenient when u only have to fly some 500 km drop yo bombs upon tegeran and be back. u will even have some time left to write a letter home and have a nap after lunch, huh. again, we will have a chance to have several hundreds soldiers from north azerbajan absolutely for free. after war in iran azerbajan will have iranian northn provinces and will retract their claims for karabakh. armenians relax and enjoy it. wheeeee"
770,sarc,"dont come tell me who is a die hard christian. that is sick, did god place you in a place of christian authority? no, it just so happens, god did not. it would have been far more acceptable for you to come and ask me or some other die hard, proven christian. proven? yes, snatched out of addictions and my former life style for the sole purpose of exalting christ name. i was smart already, was talented already, and was already the best at what i did. but christ showed me a whole new light. immediately, in one moment of time, i didn't even want to smoke weed or any of the things i had just a second ago been doing. born agian. that was september 2001, haven't touched any of it. if you want to know, next time ask."
771,sarc,"your a wall. and where did i do this? ok, perfesser, even if i did do more research my stance would not change.  i never asked you to. like the old saying goes it takes a xxxxx to know a xxxxx. :)"
772,sarc,"then you would want me to be something god did not create me to be? silly, i 'd say! humans are part of the animal kingdom. mammals if i remember from biology. are you not an animal? if not, maybe the mothership will come and pick you up soon."
773,sarc,"you're right justine. organized religion has always been used by some people as crutch in order to feel superior to others. why use your brain and heart if you don't have to? because they are encouraged by their particular religion to behave this way, they think it's 'morally' alright. 'sickening' is a good way to put it."
774,sarc,"parents want convenience and to pacify their children with a 'happy meal'. most kids don't ask for lettuce, they ask for burgers. wonder why mcdonalds doesn't add a soy burger to their menu? they have salads and adding soy products would be another way to show they 'care' about health. the answer might be they have done consumer research and found the costs to create/market a new soy product outweight the profits."
775,sarc,"right from your copy-n-paste arsenals, huh? wow some of those sites you all are posting are scary. most of them are activist-oriented sites, special interest groups etc.  not exactly an unbiased bunch. 'exgaywatch?' omg."
776,sarc,but should the elected legislature based in part on partisan politics be telling our courts which case to look at and which case not to look at? i thought there was a reason we had 3 seperate branches of government.
777,sarc,"the important question is; do i care? hitler was elected. the fact people participate in a ritual ceremony to consecrate the government of the day every 3 or 4 years makes it no more or less valid in my eyes. explain why china would have any motivation to nuke europe. until you can do that, all this 'china's gonna get you unless you support us global hegemony!!' is tired old scare tactics, typical fascist fearmongering from those seeking any justification for us wrongs they can find. china is wrong in its actions against tibet. that doesn't mean we should support wrongful behaviour by the us."
778,sarc,"that's probably being saved for the next round of national election fodder. maybe something on the order of occupying all the me, making it a christian democracy while we use their oil for their own good? with every family owning their own home, two cars and a boat. wait, they've used that promise and it failed. not to worry, i'm sure they'll come up with something that'll keep the sheep headed towards the cliff."
779,sarc,"no doubt referencing fox, huh? silly me, i should watch the real experts...cnn, cbs, nbc, abc...oh yeah, folks i would trust to give me complete, unbiased reporting. anyway, you choose to follow whatever the scumbag husband says, and i choose to follow the prudent path. by the way, she was already in this 'vegetative state'...how could he have suddenly decided it's not what she wanted...coincidentally around the time he shacked up with the other chick...gullible to say the least"
780,sarc,"yeah, you are right dono.....so explain to me about the constitution??? would you like to start with the federalist papers and move on from there? i have yet to hear someone prove me wrong on the constitution. if you think that the cruel and unusual term doesn't apply to the living constitution then you are sadly mistaken. how do you think it became that the death penalty for minors is illegal now? the court 15yrs ago said differently!!! how can the inerpretation change with no basis other then ones own personal opinion? this is scary..people, you gotta think this stuff through!"
781,sarc,"if homosexuals don't think, how can they choose to become good vaginal penetrators? the fact is, the more homosexuality there is, the less abortions. if you were a gay you could rest assured that your man-wife would never abort once. are you willing to sacrifice the lives of billions of innocent children to your personal feelings like lust towards vaginas?"
782,sarc,"they must suffer terribly in the deep snows of the canadian winter, eh? no wonder they're pouring south over the border. little emoticonxcensored ers."
783,sarc,"hey, heres a wacky idea..... how about some evidence to support creationism, ray? its all well and good finding fault with the paradigm, but the 'failure' of evolution to explain whatever it is you are rambling about, does in no way build a case for your belief.  so lets be seeing it. evidence for a 6000 year old earth, made by god."
784,sarc,"whoa! duo. give the kid a chance. it seems that you are skeptical that he can offer empirical 'proof' that his god exists. certainly, since he is a 'philosophy and theology' major he must understand the implications of 'proof' in the context of science, as well as the meaning of the term 'empirical'. after all, wouldn't those ideas be something that a philosopher would be expected to understand? so let's await his 'empirical proof' without laughter. wait until he presents his 'empirical proof' before we laugh."
785,sarc,"you know, bob caught the point i was making. why was it so hard for you to see it?  so many anti's whine and complain and compare, but as soon as the tables are turned, it's all 'mr. innocent' and 'i don't see the comparision.'  i see, it's ok for you to be biggoted and hateful, but not for anyone else. yup, the typical 'do as i say, not as i do' attitude. emoticonxrolleyes"
786,sarc,"but do you ever question it for your self? or are you content to just show up .. and let someone else tell you what it all means. the rcc has made , by their own admission, mistakes in the past are you suggesting that it won't happen again? are you suggesting they never made a mistake in their interpitation of the bible? if so you might want to tell that to gallileo remember him ? he was burned at the stake for telling the rcc that the earth went around the sun!"
787,sarc,"oh, so now you're claiming to be a psychologist too?! wow, you sure get aroud a lot!  hmmm...a failed shrink arguing over homosexuality with actual homosexuals. what does that suggest?  tomshairybills; you are way over your head and i really hate to be the one who has to keep telling you this, but you're not doing yourself any favors by continuing to dig that hole you're in even deeper."
788,sarc,yes i see you calling him names. shooter..who brought pol pot back from the dead? i feel like i'm thumbing through a jihadist website for ecoterrorists.  this is a legitimate argument? sad but funny at the same time:) i never said i tried ignoring you..you constantly fail to read my posts
789,sarc,"what about god? so many god-fearing people, he must be a terrorist :) seriously i really don't know much about terrorists. i know that bin laden was behind 9/11 but he wasn't the only one, but that's about it."
790,sarc,"so, you admit defeat to a child? you have no argument and can only name call. answer my posts with something other than ad hominem or admit defeat."
791,sarc,"you didn't even read the articles i posted did you? how does it feel to be a fraud, specifically a user of argument via laziness.  you are no better then the great deciever, satan. :p"
792,sarc,"they don't have toilets there. they have buckets to poop in. the guards threw the korans in the buckets. but yeah, who needs credible reporting? bush reported that saddam bought uranium from niger. this was based on a forged report from a source that the cia said wasn't credible. that sparked some violence and deaths if i recall."
793,sarc,wrong again!! .. as was just politely pointed out to me a minuet ago it's about ' what does termination stop ' and my answer adresses this. it's a valid point .. focus on the life here first befor allowing more unwanted life to be come a part of the system.  have you adopted an unwanted child yet? if not i would submit you should focus you anti abortion energy on those kids first.
794,sarc,"and suddenly vor's list of incorrect statements has finished another lap around the universe! the area which was litterally saturated with cruise missiles was sparsely populated. the brass complained about 'hitting empty tents with multi-million dollar cruise missiles.'  suddenly you are concerned with killing innocent civilians? seriously, you have no problem when bush's policies gets a few thousand killed, but the instant clinton's massive cruise missile launch aganist terrorists kills one innocent, you're all over him. talk about massive hypocracy. you bitch about clinton not doing anything, then you bitch when his attacks on terrorism cause collateral.  seriously, get some therapy and some education."
795,sarc,there is no link that i know of..............do you know what cspan is? its a television network here in the u.s...........it shows demonstrations and protests among other things............. what other flags are you talking about? emoticonxconfused i don't know about where you live but in this country we have only one national flag....... maybe where you live you want to protect toilet paper.if you do go for it.......... emoticonxrolleyes you have a lot to learn in life young man.....hopefully with age will come wisdom.........
796,sarc,"what kind of question is that? we can't have true freedom until dissenters have been hunted down and killed, or tossed into th gulag...er, i mean, prison, for demonstrating their dissent."
797,sarc,"a majority of the planet believes in a higher power, so i allready have the majority agreement on this. how about you come up with a test to see if god doesnt exist... well? i'm waiting."
798,sarc,"holy cow! so you are an aussie now? in various other forums you have claimed to be chilean, german, and god knows what else....whatever suited you at that moment. emoticonxrolleyes"
799,sarc,"depends. how big is the bear? if it was a gorilla, and he was 400 lbs, then he can xxxx anywhere he xxxxxxn pleases. i ain't messing with that.  :p"
800,sarc,so then women who are pregnant shouldn't be allowed to 1) smoke 2) take any kind of drug that could possibly harm the child 3) drink or do any otherwise legal action? and vor takes another giant step towards fascism.
801,sarc,"generalisations - do not europeans make huge generalisations about americans too ? is it the usual double standard ? europeans can make generalisations, but americans cannot make generalisations."
802,sarc,hey hydra - -  you know what i find amazing? all the men on this board who found pregnancy to only be a minro inconvenience. i am am just anxious for them to tell me more about their pregnancies....
803,sarc,"let's say that the law, based upon some kind of verifiable scientific data, decides that some folks are inferior to other folks, and thus less of a person? you know, if the law said 'because you are black, you are less of a person than shomeone who is white. you shouldn't be upset though, all scientific data suggests that you, because you are black, are truly inferior to those who are white.' would you think, because the law said so, that a black person was in fact a non-person?"
804,sarc,"how did cjd come about again? i know it had somethig to do with cows and chickens, but i forget the details."
805,sarc,"every single time you make the assisinine statement 'the baby isn't the woman's body' you downplay the part the woman's body plays. maybe it isn't the body - but it can't live without the woman's body. the owner of said body should be making decisions for said body.  when you are willing to force pregnancy against the will and without the voice of the woman who is pregnant - you are hi-jacking her body. i forget - are you one of those force the rape victim to carry the baby lifers? pretty close and i will fight you hard if you try trample one inch of it.  i still don't give a damn what they may or may have not have thought about abortion, nor was that an argument i was trying to make."
806,sarc,"you ever seen 'schindler's list?' how about ever read a book about the holocaust? i'm guessing not, because you have no clue what you're talking about. there is a huge difference between using psychological 'torture' if you wanna call it that for the purposes of extracting information and what the nazis did. not providing a detainee air conditioning is as bad as the nazis? playing rap music too loud? hell, even chaining someone in a room for long periods of time...sure, it's unpleasant, perhaps to a great degree. but come on, i'd rather go through all of that than endure a nazi pow or concentration camp."
807,sarc,"don't you insult african americans!  i have posted a number of times links and comments by prominant black leaders who infact do support gay marriage. when will you stop your 'don't insult african americans' lies when you know all too well just how wrong you actually are?  oh that's right...never, because you just don't care what anyone thinks if it at all differs from your opinion.  weren't you spanked enough in the 'banned people' forum?"
808,sarc,"you are attempting to trivialize the bias we who are gay, face, against our sexuality. you try to trivialize everything we have accomplished in terms of social acceptance, that heterosexuals have always taken for granted. your assinine comments show sensitivity to no one. maybe you'd like to start a pride movement for ignorant, insensitive, jackasses? society is moving so against that group right now."
809,sarc,"not to me, but let's not quibble about things we can't change. let's talk about something that we can change...for a change. we could argue about it forever and never change one thing that's written. how about making a proposal suited to fit those whose religious beliefs tend to make us feel inferior? or passing legislation that more medical staff be trained in 'special' fields of medicine for certain diseases so that constant referrals won't bounce us off the walls."
810,sarc,really?! cool!  can you tell me where to find one these places that will turn me into a lesbian? men have been such a pain in my xxx all these years. i am sick and tired of finding them attractive. emoticonxrolleyes
811,sarc,and you don't think 9/11/01 was and attack on this country huh? emoticonxrolleyes  you are exactly the kind of liberal carl rove was talking about in his speech the other day.......
812,sarc,"degress of being christian? so i can say i am only half christian? a level 2 christian? is it like medicare i am christian part a, but will become part b at age 65....."
813,sarc,"then what are you doing in this thread? or to quote yourself: game, set, match, gamehuis is teh win!11@!@11 :p"
814,sarc,"but they do come under the definition. why do you say they don't? what evidence do you have to say they don't? the fetus/embryo is part of the human species. you define species as a group of organisms that are capable of reproduction among themselves. this just to to define species and not the individual organism. as i said, a 1 day old baby can't reproduce, many 90yr old man can't either. some are born without the abilty and never will reproduce. however, the general population can reproduce and thus they are all in the same species. the embryo has all it needs to grow. food and other enviromental stuff is not part of oneself is it? what you are saying is that you are not a human because you require food and other enviromental needs to grow."
815,sarc,no practical purpose?! i'dcall preventing the killing of fetuses practical. so would most rational people. emoticonxrolleyes
816,sarc,"[quote=justinecredible]making a snap judgement like that doesn't win you any brownie points either. genesis 18 - 19  deuteronomy 23:17  how about a more specific condemnation from the bible, then? will that help? leviticus 18:22 'you [masculine] shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.'   leviticus 20:13 'if a man lies with a male as a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall be put to death, their blood is upon them.'   any ambiguity there, jc? emoticonxrolleyes  oh no, jc's going to start quoting scripture at me. better find a good search engine if you want to go there. :)"
817,sarc,"'poor bill' ? yes poor poor bill, i really feel sorry for him for having the misfortune to meet monica . anybody who had the bad luck to meet monica deserves our compassion and pity. yes.... poor poor bill....so hillary was a saint and lord knows what monica was !"
818,sarc,"well, we're not talking about the right to privacy now, are we emoticonxrolleyes  oh no! of course not ... if don't want to include the issues of lost homes, lack of hospital visitation, lack of health insurance coverage, no access to survivor benefits, unfair taxation, etc.. no harm at all emoticonxrolleyes  but they're not adults now, are they? love the red herring, btw. discrimination has to be justified. otherwise it is unconstitutional. not true. their marriages may not be recognized. doesn't make them illegal though. for one thing, the whole 'slippery-slope' argument is a logical fallacy. and secondly, since we do not live in a true democracy (this is a constitutional republic, after all), the rights of the minority cannot be infringed upon by the majority. milk and cookies for you for voting, though :)"
819,sarc,"why shouldn't iran have them? perhaps because they signed a treaty saying they wouldnt in the precious un, of course i think we are all in agreement that the un is more or less a waste of time and money. how about the whole death to america slogan? now we have one of the grass roots nutters from teh revolution as the iranian president. it could be there un-ending support for hezbollah and hamas, neither having any qualms about its hatred for the us. like i said, there are some that just don't get it. count yourselves among that crowd."
820,sarc,"what joe was saying is: what is 's?'  not to mention the really terrible lack of usage of capitol leters. try just a little basic grammar, huh?  also, to 'love' your brother is to support you brother. not to mention the fact that more than half of all heterosexual marriages end in divorce, so why complain about homosexuals and what you claim as 'pretending?'  i mean, what skin is it off your nose anyway?  what's sad is you point your finger at those you don't understand and who you think are different from you, when all along, you're no better."
821,sarc,how about when it dawns on you who he was when he came the first time? lol! trade in your blinders for some spiritual light!
822,sarc,"no, it's pertinent to the behavior of some homoseuxals. not all.  no, it's not the article we have a problem with, it's the person who posted it. you!  oh, that's right, you are free to criticize the gay rights movement all you want, but when anyone dares to criticize you and your motives it's a whole new ball game?  actually it is. why did you ignore my post? i responded with other 'sexual health' related articles, but i see you ignored them...they are reality as well.  honey, your religious beliefs wouldn't be of issue if they did not directly oppose our movement to gain equal access to rights. duh!"
823,sarc,"how many counts would a recount count if a recount could count counts? a recount would count all the counts that count, but the recount may not count."
824,sarc,"i lived next door to a dope dealer who was a murderer, am i dead ? no !"
825,sarc,are you serious??? his avatar is hardly any stranger than yours!
826,sarc,"only two choices? poor god, infinity reduced to black or white."
827,sarc,poet i found it interesting your illutration of the 'matirx' series. i too have seen the two episodes and found it filled with religious overtones. i dont know the faith of the wachaski brothers but there story is intreging. all mankind decived by this lifstyle which as seen from reality is merely a save to produce power. much like mankind is decived by satan today. a select group of people who believe that a savior wil come to free man kind from this savery. even those who have seen the truth and reject it. this sounds alot like the account of the bible. i want so much to see the final episode to find if the theme continues. will neo's death be that which saves all mankind? we will wait and see.
828,sarc,"kronus, like i said, you have to accept that (abiogenesis) by faith, don't you, since no one has ever seen it take place? and it can't be replicated either, can it?  oh ye of great faith! lol!"
829,sarc,"1. who said i didnt? 2. no. do i need to? 3. why would i need to preach to people? to annoy and inflame? 4. thats dennis quaid you dolt. from the film 'the right stuff' you should see it, but bewarned it contains some decidedly unchristian messages such as desecration of the sacred sound barrier, references to air 'demons', the use of rocketry, use of the heliocentric model of the solar system, 'pagan' aboriginies and presbeterians. you'll love it."
830,sarc,"orion's follies: some other goodies from that site... never linked to those specific articles.  but before orion gets too self-righteous, let's look at some ot the topics he considered 'funny' in a link he gave over at the usat creation / evolution forum: christian crimes - pastor molests widow's boys - pastor molests adopted daughters - priest molests altar boys - late for church - christian racist kidnapper - music pastor molests - bush's faith-based failure - pastor molest, guns, drugs - $400,000 missing - priest molests - church youth coach molests - bush suppresses student prayer - sen byrd's 'white ('n' word)'  is this funny? it's apparently real funny to orion. his link also had a pornographic sub-link on the virgin mary, describing her in graphic, profane language.  orion - christ-deniers like you and brummer need a lot of help."
831,sarc,ok. so are you going to follow all the other laws about stoning people to death too? hmmmmmmmmmm. emoticonxfrazzled  guess i better go find a bunch  of rocks. next question being:'who do i throw at first?' what about 'glass houses?'
832,sarc,"bush can't run again, so who's the idiot? emoticonxrolleyes  won't happen. i'm not stupid enough to buy a house below sea level in a known flood plain. ut don't let me influence your decisions. ;)  and you dnc parots have no originality.  hum, i'm not sure i know what a gop christian is. is that like a catholic with a twist? emoticonxclown"
833,sarc,"well, who was the head of fema appointed by? a brief googling seems to suggest a mr. g.w. bush was responsible, it wouldn't be entirely out of the question for dubya to appoint another member of the christian right to this permission, who might be keen for christian charities to be promoted. other possible reasons are that religion is very strong in the south, and hence religious charities are more likely to have resources in the south, were the problem is. in any case, the red cross is by far the largest organisation involved, and as has already been estalbished is secular. and as i said before just because the organisations are christian doesn't necessarily mean that their workers or contributors are."
834,sarc,"saying you have an 'anti-supernatural bias' is akin to saying you have a bias for common sense, logic and reason. why don't you believe my cup of coffee is god? because you have no proof? well, that's an easy argument to over-come; it's supernatural, so it doesn't need to obey your mundane laws. -wez"
835,sarc,a bit over the top here eh? quicksand?...butcher babies? wow...very sensational... i have a question for ya ez? do you own any slaves? do you have a beard or long hair? have you stoned any non-virgin brides lately. seeing as though you are so adherant to the bible....i figure you at best have smited a neighbor or two this week?
836,sarc,what's the difference between ignorance and apathy? answer: i don't know and i don't care. emoticonxclown
837,sarc,"i wonder how there could be such accurate data before satellites? how did people track storms deep in the atlantic i wonder. maybe they could have followed them with ships, but that would be very dangerous, and how would they know when the storm started?"
838,sarc,"so, global warming no, but weather control devices, yes? perhaps too many people are playing red alert these days..."
839,sarc,"is this your idea of a joke? if so, it's pretty pathetic one. i was talking about the way all christians deal with temptations of every kind."
840,sarc,"trebor - it's humerous to watch your denial mechanism work overtime, trebor. for the 3rd of 4th time, where in your tanakh does it say your animal sacrifices for sin were abolished? shouldn't you be out trying to find a nice young lamb or ram for slaughter? lol!"
841,sarc,"i can't believe he used that on me. just goes to show that he will mimic not only preachers but any one else that he thinks will make him look good at the time. ez why don't you stop this?? people will actually converse with and discuss things that you feel are important if you would only think for yourself. forget the dogma,.. forget the spoon feed interpetations of a dusty old book and think for yourself. people will actually begin to take you seriously."
842,sarc,"why say these two things together? is there a bestiality issue bubbling under the surface here? you appear to have esteem issues here as well as a persecution complex. we're not all abusing and attacking and berating you, or your precious little birds either. @liminus- by the way, i though 'volcanoes of prejudice' was one of the coolest phrases i've heard in a while."
843,sarc,"see, it's fun. finally, some one came to this thread and posted something. i had in mind the song 'hard on me' by asia but oh well. someone finally posted on here besides me and the 'more reference' question from master_shake. now, can someone take my post here and do the exact same thing? i'll use a lot of words so you have stuff to take out and mess with and play around with all you want. so now there is only one question that i have...who's next?"
844,sarc,"my hate of iniquity vs. your love for it? get a new dog, brummer."
845,sarc,"what are you? nuts? you know that in our 'gun free' society, you are more likely to be a victim of violent crime, armed robbery or homicide than you were before the howard government tightened the gun laws? i mean, you know we are less safe now, right? but hey, at least we can rest easy knowing people are only be being bashed and stabbed to death, rather than shot. god bless australia, huh?"
846,sarc,"no reply bassman? seriously mate, i can understand why some people on this forum have a problem with you, you can't just go around posting total lies! you are a sensible guy, for the most part, lets have some reasonable arguments as oppose to mindless bigotry."
847,sarc,"i don't know, terran. are you scared poohbear? do you actually have any evidence to bring to us? we'd love to see some! really we would! if you could show us some hardcore, physical evidence that proves god did it, it would be the scientific revelation of the century! oh what's that? you don't have any? not even a poorly crafted straw-man argument? damn, and here i was thinking you were capable. oh yes, and if you could give us some firm, solid evidence that darwin is burning in hell, we would all drop our copies of origin and bow down the lord.  whats that? you don't have any...?"
848,sarc,depends on what you mean by 'history'.  did george washington really cut down the cherry tree? that is fiction. did george washington exist? that is documented.. and is history.
849,sarc,"also, there was a bit of a fuss over warhammer some time ago (during the ad&d is evil times) while it makes it perfectly clear that magic comes from daemons and dark gods. don't see why aliens are exempt too, the bible makes it pretty clear that these arn't real either - surely then they must be daemonic tempters as well (damn xenos)? lets not even go a step further and combined psychics and the force, yet there seemed little outcry over star wars (well phantom menace maybe..but different people, different reasons). whole thing seems bizarre to me, surely for these to be evil its admitting that witchs and wizards actual existed and still do?"
850,sarc,"what country are you from? in america the people have never had the ability to decided law. the legislature writes it, the executive approves it, and the judiciary interprets it. the people have no direct say what so ever."
851,sarc,so you are happy that they chopped of the most sensitive part of your penis? that someone took and cut out a part of your body without your consent? what if it where your nipples? after all nipples on men serve no purpose.
852,sarc,"they wheel out the old 'god made it that way' answer- ignorance is bliss and it makes life so much simpler don't you think?  now, if you were talking fjords, thats a different matter. everyone knows slarty bartfarst designed those emoticonxclown"
853,sarc,"i like how you automatically assume anyone who disagrees with you is an atheist. of course, if they were true believers(tm), then they wouldn't disagree with you, right? yeesh... i really like the sly implication that all of us who try and educate ourselves must be unemployed. surely no one would hire us atheistic evilutionists, right? glad i could make you feel important the odd spelling mistake is understandable, but you'd think when someone's trying to tear down the most solid scientific theory around they would at least know how to spell 'scientist'. it's not like it's hard. you even went to dictionary.com to get a definition, and still managed to spell it wrong!"
854,sarc,"then you are wrong, in a general way! :-) virions (free viruses) are composed of organic molecules: proteins (in their capsids) and nucleic acids (in their cores), and some also have lipids (in their envelopes). what did you think viruses were made of?  excuse me, but i didn't create a false generalization."
855,sarc,"that's not what the bible says. you're playing word games. what next? numerology??? i mean, i can play around with interpreting too. i can take 'roses are red, violets are blue' and interpret it to mean just about whatever i want it to. let's see, roses represent love, and red is the color of blood. a key characteristic of violets is that they have small flowers, and blue means sad. so what 'roses are red, violets are blue' is really and truly saying - and you must all bow down and accept my absolute insight into this - is that 'love is bloody awful, and people with 'small things' are sad'. bet you never knew that's what it was really saying!"
856,sarc,"as i observed earlier, you seem intent on attacking islam. why else would you devote so much energy to a thread entitled 'muhammed's child bride'? you've said it yourself, as in... and... howard suggested to you that you might learn something about islam by reading rumi. you asked me to quote to you from rumi? very well... spring is christ, raising martyred plants from their shrouds. their mouths open in gratitude, wanting to be kissed. the glow of the rose and the tulip means a lamp is inside. the wind is the holy spirit. the trees are mary. the scent of joseph's shirt comes to jacob. a red carnelian of yemeni laughter is heard by muhammad in mecca. and... moses, the inner light of revelation, lit up the top of sinai, but the mountain could not hold that light."
857,sarc,why do you want to cram it down other people's throats? do you really think it will earn you brownie poins in heaven? can't you followthe word of god without demanding the rest of us do? talk about perversion....get out of my decision to be faithful or not - creep.
858,sarc,"what practical and proven measures does mr monbiot propose ? i somehow doubt that he is free markets enthusiast. it's no use changing the terms of trade for countries which are not producing enough wealth to buy anything - indeed some can't even feed themselves.  reference the wto etc., what is something 'more equitable' supposed to mean ?"
859,sarc,"1) is that supposed to counter me? where's your logic that explains why god would create jesus before the printing press? without the printing press, books were copied by hand, leading to lots of errors and discrepencies in the vast number of copies.  2) are there only two types of people in the world: 'easyriders' and 'michael moores'? god is just pretend!"
860,sarc,"i just disproved the whole thing! fine, what would happen if i poked both of your eyes out? its one eye for one eye."
861,sarc,"i don't want or not want to call this 'frame of refference' *thing* anything i'm just trying to work out what you consider it is. tell me what it is. tell me what it's capabilities are. if it is abstract in nature what is it's actual worth as a concept. whatever that is... this *something*? you aren't your body as i've shown but because your body generates your mind it, that which affects the body can effect the mind which i can only imagine is part of this 'frame of refference' *thing*. or, in reality, 'i', 'you' and 'me' is an illusion and doesn't actually exist."
862,sarc,can you actually back up your claims? if the bill does not affect criminals then why has gun crime been going down since the brady law became a law? a simple question. how did they break the law? the background check would stop them from breaking the law by not allowing them to purchase a gun. if you don't support background checks then you support criminals just walking into a store and buying a gun and then going free after they have illegally purchased a gun. why do you want criminals to go free after they've broken a law?  are you for real? i've never heard of a hate group that hates inanimate objects.
863,sarc,"boy $346,000? i can think of a few $300,000 firearms in existance today. if anyone of them every shot and killed a person, boy it would be sooooo easy to trace it down. so then why bother banning them? using a $300,000 gun to shoot someone is like hit and run in a bright red ferrari in a busy intersection, the cops are going to find you."
864,sarc,"uhm, you do realize that humans and chimps are not the same things as dogs, cats, horses, and sharks ... right?  i am under no obligation to address the evolutionary origin every possible organism. let's review the facts. 1) i said there is a ton of evidence for macroevolution, and there is.  2) i gave a specific example, saying that i could provide multipe lines of independent evidence supporting the fact that humans and chipms share a common evolutionary ancestor. and i can."
865,sarc,"who decides which portions are appropriate for literal interpetation? how od you know they are right? has it ever occured to you that the whole invisible man in the sky thing is probably not a good canidate for literal interpetation?  perhaps, as the roman elite at the time claimed, the bible was compiled, and christianity was heavily pushed, primarily as a method of controlling the people. we know the bible was heavily edited. we know that much of it was written decades after the events occured, and not by the folks claimed. isn't literally interpeting anything that fraudulent a pretty poor idea?"

867,sarc,"if i'm translating this correctly, you're saying that when asked the 'big questions' an athiest says 'i don't know', a christian says 'ooh, i have the answers', and you see this as a sign of athiest arrogance? saying 'based on no evidece i'm sure a super-being did it' is less arrogant in your eyes than simply admitting ignorance? that's not how i would use the word arrogance."
868,sarc,"uhm, dude, you asked me to explain! you asked for it: you got it: now you whine!?!?!?! and you can avoid asking me questions, especially if you don't think you are going to like th answer. you sure can. just don't ask for my opinion again, or i will give it to you again!"
869,sarc,"but to some it is the word of their god. you see? you have no god so you dont have to worry (at least not yet). and 'divine', so you are saying besides sarcastic rhetoric that they were divinely inspired cause you labled them that. sears is now jcpenney's get with the times. and no it wouldnt be hung there cause you can tbuy drapes in revelation. fiction: archaeologival evidence is fiction? sick: yes soddom and ghamorah was a sad story. dangerous: yes to those who feel their sins bearing down on them. virulent manual for the self-destruction of the human race: history, salvation, truth. or is fiction today's word on sesame street?"
870,sarc,"and what does that have to do with anything? lev was specificlaly talking about purity for the temple.. of course, that is over your head."
871,sarc,would anyone here object to your 16 year old daughter camping out with 21 year old men? how about your 16 year old son with 21 year old women? edit: whoa! this thread is older than i thought.
872,sarc,"so, tell me simone. do you ever start threads other than anti-christian ones?emoticonxcensored  and did you actually read his encyclical or did you just parrot someone's interpretation of it because you were too lazy to actually read it for yourself? oh, and the only people that i hate are hypocrites. have a nice day. emoticonxrolleyes"

875,sarc,were you hiding under a rock until recently? phelps has been making the news for years for showing up at gay (and other) funerals. i think they even had a phelps-based character picketing funerals in one of those pc gay-rights themed movies like the laravie project didn't they?
876,sarc,thugs ?? i thought one of them was an actor ? oh wait ... i guess that would be plausable today!
877,sarc,"go out there and find all kinds of democrat-led, black-led, white-led, mexican-led, etc.. efforts to protect gay rights. just because you can't find them doesn't mean they're against them. saying all republicans are against gay rights because one of them is, is bigoted, stereotypical and childish. quite moronic too. is it also your claim that all blacks are prejudiced because they haven't formed the naawp yet? grow up."
878,sarc,"you're completely clueless, aren't you monty? there is much more distinguishing a human from a chimpanzee or gorilla skull than size. here's a hint. check the link which lurch provided. is sample a only a small version of sample n? is sample i a large case of a or a small case of n?  btw 'kind' is a meaningless creationist term. feel free to provide your own perculiar definition if you are fame."
879,sarc,"if something is modified, does it not become better, or more complex? there's nothing wrong with those terms, unless you're a degreed scientist who is talking down to common peasants.  all .00001% of them? you're not the only one i debate. emoticonxidea  does talkorigins have one? they are used as a reference here constantly - i don't think the asa has been referred to a single time, until now.  talkorigins feedback section supports my position."
880,sarc,"is this you trying to save face? you say in this very box that's what it says. i wasn't referring to what your bible says. i am referring to your half baked hypothesis that the fall caused chemical imbalances in some part of us that causes some of us to be xxxxx. what evidence, aside from your own half-witted notions and fancies, do you have of any chemical imbalance from the fall? it's also quite a laugh that you're saying i'm in a box. coming from you who knows only how to copy and paste arguments from other websites and from his bible into the debate."
881,sarc,"why should a mere little baby have to earn the love of its parents? good god! what kind of parenting is that? i will love you, my child, if you deserve my love."
882,sarc,"its another thing to allow guns and put thousands of people in danger. if you want to decide your own destiny don't do it at others expense. should people be allowed to carry bombs on as well? montalban, airplanes didn't exist. this was before the word terrorism existed. none of the founding fathers had something this extreme in mind. should people be allowed to carry bombs on as well?  always stay open minded"
883,sarc,"just because an admin hasnt noticed, that means you are right? boy, thats some thinking right there. chill out. we can have a civilized debate, or we can try to act like were in 8th grade gym class. your choice."
884,sarc,"oh, did i also mention a propensity for extreme exagerration on your part? all of a whopping 2 or 3 people here have said that about me, and a couple of them tend to say things like that about everyone they disagree with.  i think i'll give this exageration thing a try . . .  'hey kronos, did you know that everyone who exchanges two posts with you ends up calling you a quibbler?' hey, this is sorta fun! emoticonxgood"
885,sarc,"ok, i understand now. all those people, including children and the fetuses of pregnant women were all sinful and god had to murder them in tsunamis, earthquakes, etc.,  is that how god deals with overpopulation? i guess that wars are part of god's plan, too, because the recent invasion of iraq wiped out more than 100,000 iraqis according to god's plan for dealing with overpopulation."
886,sarc,"studies from 1955, 1961, 1964? i believe that a lot has happened since those years."

888,sarc,"confirming god is, at best, a one-on-one job....anyway. unless someone has personally experienced the things of god - how would one go about proving it? i know, i know...can't prove a negative...."
889,sarc,"did you say something about an irrational outburst? i on the other hand certainly have, as always, maintained my unrivaled dignity. thank you very much, buckwheat. and once again, my deepest apologies."
890,sarc,we always talk about the 2nd amendment in relation to gun rights. does anyone remember the tattered and neglected ninth amendment? i don't think it was ratified just to fill up space!
891,sarc,"alittle over 5 years...? try 5 years this september. you know the people who did it?! then please call the fbi immediatly and tell them what you've discovered, because they can't prove osama bin laden had a connection to september 11, 2001.  that's correct. we carpet bombed afghanistan and overthrew the government we established there without having any evidence connecting osama bin laden to 9/11. and right, then we invaded iraq saying they were also some how connected as well. and you were so certain ubl attacked us? wow, you must be smarter than the entire american intelligence agency. sorry for my sarcastic response, but the mentality you're trying to push forward is except everything the government tells us and never question their motives or actions. please research alittle before posting something like this."
892,sarc,how many light bulbs does it take to screw in a light bulb? ponder that and call me in the morning.
893,sarc,"australia has a socialist government? that's news to all 18million australians. our ruling coaltion consists of the liberal party and the national party. the liberal party is not 'liberal' but conservative. if you have evidence that the australian labor party is actually in power, and not as we believe, then please forward this... it will be a massive shock to all of us. but anyway, the knee-jerk reaction you display... (if seat-belts become compulsory, it must be the work of those damn socialists!) is frightening... considering you guys have nuclear weapons!"
894,sarc,did you read joe's letter from this guy? http://www.joebrummer.com/adams-emails.htm oh he hates gay people and has declared war upon us. if they come for us we will fight. i will not go to the camps with out taking a few of them out.
895,sarc,"something tells me that the goal posts for what constitutes 'credible evidence' in daewoo's responses are actually mounted on a very portable platform . . . 'what? a cnn news story about an online statements for which it makes no sense for anyone else to have made the statement? 'no, no, i meant credible credible evidence . . . a known council issued the statement?? no, i meant credible, credible, credible evidence . . .' and oh, they aren't al queda, they're just al queda-linked!' whew, glad that's cleared up--i feel much better about it now. emoticonxrolleyes"
896,sarc,"like i said in another thread, the argument i hear most often from so-called 'pro-choicers' is that you cannot legislate morality. well then what can you legislate? every law in existence is legislation of morality! by that way of thinking, then we should have no laws. if someone kidnaps and murders your 3-year-old child, then let's hope the murderer goes free because we cannot legislate morality!"
897,sarc,"archie, that wasn't a prophecy you neo marxist socialist, it was a hope. neo, marxist socialist, eh? three compliments in the same sentence. see you can be nice if you really really try. nice to know i am continuing the proud tradition that my parents established so many years ago. my father voted for debs, and my mother voted for foster. archie, sweetie, your flattery will get you nowhere, try as you might."
898,sarc,"he's an american consumer, that's all the qualifications he needs. 'so what? does it really matter who we borrow money from? bringing china in to lend us money accomplishes 2 things: 1. we get the money' spoken like a true american consumer. no need to pay back the money you loaned or the interest on that money. just spend, spend, spend. btw have you maxed out your mandatory 10th creditcard yet? remember, spending money is patriotic. on a side note, i must say that i find stupidity on this scale both amusing and alarming at the same time. who would have thought that such ignorance was still possible in an age where information is so easily obtainable... left is right. up is down. war is peace."
899,sarc,"this is supposed to be meaningful, coming from someone who won't even read the replies in his own train wreck threads? get real."
900,sarc,"personally, i think religious people who try to impose their religion on other people are complete xxxxxx, and if there was a hell, they should be the ones sent there. now we have a government supporting things like torture, gun control, terrorism, pro-life proppoganda, and now their teaching religion in public schools? i dont mind you being religious, but when you try to impose the religion on public school kids, thats a little messed up. there is very little evidence supporting creationism, and evolution obviously has more evidence to support it. so why do people still believe in creationism? i thought that passed back in the 1600s, i didnt know people still believed in it."
901,sarc,"so much bs... where should i start? eugenics is about manipulating genomes of populations. since when are most abortions performed for the purpose of lowering or raising the frequency of certain alleles or traits in populations? if a woman wants to maximize her life, liberty, and happiness, and she feels that she can best do so by aborting a pregnancy, your intended prevention of that action 'flies in the face of the declaration of independence'... (not that the declaration has any legal standing.) whether an embryo or fetus is human is irrelevant. no thing, human or not, has the right to subsist completely on a human without the latter's consent. 'abortive technologies'? you sound like falwell, insisting that cloning destroys life when it does nothing of the sort. please explain your laughable statement."
902,sarc,"sorry, but those examples are covered in the ten commandments. if you really want no homosexuality, you'd better close down most clothes manufacturers, sell your daughter into slavery, stone adulterers, and shut down every red lobster and crab shack. how is it redundant? everything i stated was fact and you cannot prove otherwise - that is, unless you claim some perfect men wrote the bible (which would contradict the bible which says man cannot be perfect). you need to back up your claim with reasoning (otherwise i'll just go to all of your posts, call them redundant without proving it, and say nice try - see how redundant that would be?)"
903,sarc,"how very odd that you seem able to perceive this need, while being incapable of satisfying it. one might almost suspect that there is, in fact, no substance to back up your bald statements of denial, and that you are simply seeking to disengage from the debate whilst losing as little face as possible. tell me: how's that panning out for you? dreadfully sorry; missed you asking about this before. 'original post' (sometimes 'original poster' in context): the post or poster who began the thread. i thought the abbreviation was in common use; sorry!"
904,sarc,"d'ya think i should? make a mel gibson film and suddenly everyone's an expert eh? well despite what his gibson-ness would have us believe, gallipoli was a case of bad luck, incompetence and generals f*cking everyone over regardless of nationality. remember we lost huge numbers of british troops too. now i don't downplay the role of the anzacs, or their losses. but this was at a time when the british considered australians to be one and the same as themselves. there was hardly the conscious effort to use the anzacs as fodder over the tommies. gallipoli was a blunder (though again not as big a blunder as populist history has us believe) for everyone, regardless of nationality. there was certainly no sinister us and them between our nations- we were essentially considered as one."
905,sarc,"yada yada yada.... jesus was a pretty nice fellow (and god) but you don't believe him either, so what's the point? you'll get your evidence soon enough."
906,sarc,"originally posted by easyrider: (to: shooterandproud) did i take you to raise?  you're not from around here, are you?  what it means is that i'm not obligated to wet nurse / answer all the follies of dedicated christ-bashers."
907,sarc,you never voted for a democrat? well i'm glad i'm not blinded by faith like you! emoticonxangel a counter man at the local napa store who took good care of my parts needs ran for school board years ago (a democrat) and ~i~ voted for him!!!! am i an independent thinker or what? :p
908,sarc,"so the terrorists have been funneling perfectly good bomb money into american politics to help the democrats get elected, right mr. conspiracy theorist? i suppose the terrorists are planting bogus information so that those awful news reporters will lie to the american people, too? (oh, wait, that's the bush administration doing that, not the terrorists...) if you hate me, and i hate terrorists, don't you see any possible way that the 21st century communications (news reporting and money transfer) could cause terrorists to benefit you? after all, the enemy of your enemy is your friend, right? see, marc, when your logic is as asinine as this, it can 'show' anything. neat how democrats are all now atheists. but then, according to marc, so are catholics, jews, muslims, mormons..."
909,sarc,you really have no idea what a argument is? i do find it amusing you will lose every argument you get into with your significent other.
910,sarc,"you ever see those plympton cartoons? where someone's head blows up like a balloon, and their eyes pop out, and then their head collapses in on itself until it looks like a burnt match stick? that's what your post just did to me. it was a fascinating mental experience; so thanks for that, anyway."
911,sarc,"so was dominating and enslaving of women. doesn't mean we should do it just because it has historicity.  actually i've heard this idea by numerous people, on both sides of the issue. i can see the merits myself--give couples' benefits in a way that doesn't utilize a cultural and religious institution that has nothing to do with legality to begin with. that way at least cultural marriage doesn't have to be redefined to any extent and legal benefits would no longer be any sort of reflection of any one group's cultural and ideological views.  by the way, what do you mean by 'anti-gay' in your phrase 'anti-gay people'? that's always important to nail down."
912,sarc,i see your point. you wanna see mine? can you point to the point...if there is one? i've seen lots of points on scoreboards. do party hats count as points? (some of them indeed are pointed.)
913,sarc,"i take it you just think this man/woman's a looney then?  it's quite convenient that the bad spirits are living in such a highly narrow minded society. they can do what they want to people, screw them up etc...and what happens to the poor souls? they get sent to a mental institute! lol  'but i did see it, im not mental!' 'yeah sure you did!' bang, there goes any creditable eyewitnesses. he/she is simply crazy and locked up. if you can't physically prove it with science then you're crazy. if you can't explain it, it doesn't exist...yeah right."
914,sarc,"'on site'? so your going to build h2 production plants in everybody's garage? how do you plan on pressurizing the h2 in your garage? do you plan on including a near absolute zero refrigerator to be part of the system or are you going to require that everyone have $1million worth of explosion-proof handling equipment, storage tanks, etc.,? emoticonxconfused and i apologize if i'm wed to the laws of chemistry and physics. it's just so darn hard for me, a trained scientist practicing my trade for 30 years, to ignore them.emoticonxrolleyes"
915,sarc,and i am a clump of human cell with shoes on...what is your point? no. you seem to refuse the idea that 'human' as a noun is used to describe a human being meaning the entity as a whole and not the individual cells that make it up. i am sorry you don't understand this but the word means what it means. i find it odd that you even care what you call a fetus anyway. your sperm is a human now? you should invest in a biology book.
916,sarc,"i'm back!! had to re-visit the real world. anyway, how is it that you say i'm confused about my sexuality, because i don't approve of gay marriage?! that is weak! people always claim things like that when they have nothing else to say. i'm straight as hell, and you really don't know me engough to say diffrently. but you on the other hand must be confused."
917,sarc,"i would agree with you, but first of all, the owner of the show has every right to not allow cameras. second, it would be a huge invasion of privacy if all women knew what their ex wives could keep spying on what they buy and what they do. they have no buisness doing that. very funny, but just because men don't want their rights violated by nosy ex wives and their lawyers and pis, does not mean that they love their guns any more than they do women. its simply a hobby. men don't insist on following women around, watching everything they buy and everything they do, do they? men are entitled to guns just as women are entitled to manicures. our rights are going out the window fast."
918,sarc,** so i don't like your lies and deliberate distortions. do i have to admire your mendacity? live with the fact that my opinion of your personal integrity is so low that i'd rather ignore you completely from now on.
919,sarc,"what sort of evidence would convert you? not only is requiring '100% proof' asinine, holding the action of the supernatural as the null hypothesis is fallaciously illogical (i.e. god of the gaps fallacy). if the christian god is real, why do two out of every three people reject it? see why this doesn't work? your approach is another fallacy, argumentum ad populum (appeal to the people). if the planets really do revolve around the sun, how come galileo was the only one who believed it? i guess the planets didn't revolve around the sun until that last person needed to make the majority switched his belief..."
920,sarc,"does that matter? isn't it obvious? you get your friends to vote you for and it allegedly makes every single one of our failures in the debate no longer matter. exoneration through popularity. quite stupid really, but what can you expect?"
921,sarc,"ever heard of the good old 'i caught a fish this big' story, and others similar to it? that's what happened here. it is perfectly logical to assume that someone witnessed a large flood, and over time it all got blown out of proportion and became the ludicroud claim of the entire world flooding and a man making a boat (which is pretty much incapable of actually floating and surviving a flood) and carrying two of every animal. with each telling of a story, things are changed and added and exaggerated - that's just common sense."
922,sarc,that's pretty damn funny comming from you. if i am wrong why do you have countless threads that have been abandoned after you encountered people who refuted you? i don't play shotgun with frauds. look up gulliable in the dictionary. http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/ch/ch710_1.html try again. basilio uchuya and his wife admit to drawing them to sell to tourists based on comic books. you fell for a tourists scheme! how amusing.
923,sarc,"is hillary clinton a truthful politician? perhaps 'truthful politician' is an oxymoron. if her robust commentary on the iranian regime isn't just an attempt to appease (some) republican sentiment in her bid for the presidency, then she should state what 'clear and unequivocal' policy she recommends that the united states should adopt in order to deal with the threat from iran. i don't think she will make clear what aggressive option she favours, if any - at least during her presidential campaign - on the grounds that it might offend (some) democratic sentiment. james."
924,sarc,"hey, archangel, i notice you didn't respond to the points i made - no argument, huh? to quote jyoshu: 'well since you didn't address my points, i'll assume you're done! a simple 'ok, i concede that ... and moving on back to the issues ...' ***jyoshu well, everyone, looks like our ez/ss clone has finally realized his argument was wrong."
925,sarc,"back to the blame us first, are we? stick to terrorist-supporting iran today. and even if we did, two wrongs still don't make a right."
926,sarc,"greetings? these day here abouts, which are these internet forums the plentifully existing posters, nature robots are inside. only early did today deliberator form notes on estland! few can be interested it, little the posters here in such goings on.  he spoke that about the country, again in tremendous fascism descends and asks for people of the sympathetic consideration to resist it. so the surplus, which, swollen high flown long eye is burned through, is typical from its ilk, without direction of the delimitation and the little direction. i hope that you have in enjoyed this of her one of small language in the answer of cheek, nevertheless that the a lot of praise for this prosa extraordinary should go babelfish!"
927,sarc,"they sure do, and make sure that there are all those women priests and women cardinals that have a say in the politics of the church. when they sealed the room to choose this current pope, how many women were in that room? when they were discussing the publication of the last catchiesm, how many women participated? it's easy to pray to a non-corporial image, because that image won't talk back and heavens forbid, give an opinion."
928,sarc,"and what are the choices of the so called 'pro-life' people? suffer through a rape or incest induced pregnancy, die from pregnancy complications without a chance of terminating it, or force women who took proper precautions which failed to go through an unwanted pregnancy while likely losing her job, scholarships, any chance at life, etc. some great choices there emoticonxrolleyes i'd swear the whole group of them have an underlying misogynistic syndrome."
929,sarc,"human is defined by whether or not you have a funeral, included in the census, and pay something to the state? a homeless illegal alien is screwed."
930,sarc,"the hate you're spewing is palpable, yet you can't even see that can you ? hypocrites, ya gotta luv em. emoticonxgood  you should know, you're the definition of obnoxious. you libs believe in free speech as long as the person speaking agrees with you. makes for some pretty boring debate without those of us who are right, if you ask me. :) more to the point, if the secular humanists can hijack our public schools in order to make political statements, why can't the other side protest by not participating ? again, you believe in free speech as long as everyone agrees with you huh ? when they don't then they must be hatemongers ? it's so typical of the liberal mental disorder it boggles the mind."
931,sarc,"social darwinism? survival of the fittest?  i'm sure that you could find a more obscure scenario than that if you really tried, jito. or are you saying that nearly 1/3 of all women of childbearing age are mentally unstable? emoticonxrolleyes"
932,sarc,"yeah, like the guy running from classroom to classroom killing at will. you think banning guns will prevent criminals from getting them? i was going to say that you live in your own little world, but then i realized the sad reality was that you are in this world stealing my oxygen.  what? either try that again, or find someone who can translate. i kinda thought that the insecure, paranoid people were the ones who were afraid to step up and take responsibility for their own safety and security. i don't need to carry a gun, i could just roll over and die like so many others when faced with an assailant intent on killing me. i choose however to take responsibility for my safety and security, and as such, want to carry a gun. there is a difference."
933,sarc,"but the question is can you prove your belief system is true? and all you've done is spew hate for religion but haven't even tried to actually answer the question. and ask yourself this. if the idea of god is such a man made plague, then god doesn't even exist right ? so if god doesn't exist then what has he done to you to make you so venomous and angry at him ? why would you be so angry at a non existent being ? i challenge you to come up with a rational answer."
934,sarc,"not really. what was once consider metaphysical fantasies are actually physical phenomena.  so you don't actually believe if that science cannot prove it, it doesn't exist?  well duh. the supernatural exists outside the field of study. science cannot prove nor disprove the supernatural. it can disprove something that was previously considered supernatural as natural. that does not mean it does not exist.  what makes you say that? virtually all myths came from a truth.  is science the world?  can science measure forgiveness? how about hope? how love? according to you, since they defy the logical criteria of science, they therefore cannot exist?"
935,sarc,"you mean pascals sucker bet? if arch is wrong, he's wasted a good portion of his life and income catering to a false priesthood, a tick suckling off the fat and meat and marrow of their 'flocks'. he's prevented himself from exploring the wonderful opprotunities this limited life has to offer for the nebulous promises that come after death is assured.  furthermore, he's extolling others to do so also. because misery needs company to justify itself and in insecurity over the rediculous beliefs they hold, they need numbers to validate their wastes and servitude."
936,sarc,"gad!!! is there no end to 'low' this putz can go?? horrible. and what's worse, he routinely damages the testimony of genuine christians with his antics."
937,sarc,"and who was on vacation when the memo from intelligence forewarned about the impending attack???? oh yes...george w. bush. who left the american troops in saudi araba??? oh yes....george herbert walker bush. whose father was a banker for adolph hitler...oh yes, again ghw bush."
938,sarc,"'i have been crucified with christ; it is no longer i who live, but christ lives in me; and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by faith in the son of god, who loved me and gave himself for me. gal.2:20 let me guess, you are an albino and a member of opus dei? seem plausible considering that you seem to enjoy pain and suffering as your religion and apparently have sworn off earthly pleasures like learning new information and understanding what goes on around you while you still can. oh well to each his own. the round church will pray for you at our next meeting (alternate tuesdays when we play fizbin).emoticonxangel"
939,sarc,"if you want more downs syndrome children entering the world, why don't you take care of them? what have you ever done for these children? oh that's right, you'd rather just sermonise about how 90% of people are 'hard-hearted'."
940,sarc,"let's look up all the definitions, shall we? here's where you got 'yours': as you can see, the definition you cited is only used once, and even then it is just one of two from that source.  i notice you ignored all of the responses to you on the thread and decide to just post this piece of work without answering people. we are waiting, oh sentient one. we have shown you creatures that match all of these definitions (or at least all of the definitions that are seen in each and every source - see how alike each one is?) - now show us how humans are the only sentient beings in the universe."
941,sarc,"what the heck? owning an airport is evil now???  it is becoming clear at this point that you're pretty much grabbing at anything you possibly can, no matter how silly, to bash jerry falwell. he did enough bad things to where you don't need to resort to the benign things, to bash him. the man is gone. you don't have to worry about him anymore. move on."
942,sarc,"so why have darwinists ignored symbiosis for decades if it was so compatible? same with developmental biology? why have developmental biologists been locked away in closets, never to be heard from until recently when they've forced themselves upon the scientific community? the reality is you have no choice: accept that organisms cooperate with each other and respond purposefully and intelligently to the environment or else. tell me though: do you now admit that individuals evolve, not populations?"
943,sarc,"absolute nonsense. nope, not at all. go read the relevant paper again. utter garbage. 'fittness'(sic), however you are defining that notion today, is a function of the relation of an organism with/to its own environment, but 'complexity', as any engineer or dictionary will tell you, is an intrinsic trait of whatever system has it; external environment be damned. so do you have a measure of complexity for a genome without reference to the external environment? really? what is that measure? you're entitled to your groundless opinion on anything, including parasites. yes i am, and i ought to be. i earned the right by doing original research on the topic of host-parasite relations as exlempified by chemical communications between them. did rather nice work at that. the core paper is still cited rather often even after 30 years."
944,sarc,"i just spat coffee on my new monitor...  wanna catch a movie, sinjin? i'll get the popcorn if you'll bring that yellow salt..."
945,sarc,"your truth?? your truth???? does it come in singles or in a bundle? do i get some sort of discount for being agnostic, that's halfway between theist and atheist, ja? does it cost extra to buy the 'be judgmental and condescending, and you will enter heaven' version, or can i just buy the 'i have so many flaws, but when they are exposed or i'm out of hand, i'll just fall back on jesus, and that makes me perfect and whole' one? nah, i'll be satisfied with 'the truth that i know is truth, not faith. let's just skip the faith process.' that hits the spot!"
946,sarc,"let's see, shall we? if you continue this claim or yours, you lose all credibility - you're no better than archangel if you continue this."
947,sarc,"my dad would sometimes talk about such things. one particular 'ditty' went something like this: at the gates of heaven :- god: i'm sorry, but you led a life full of sin. i cannot allow you into the kingdom of heaven. sinner: but god, how can you deny me entrance. you made me like this. you should have known that i would do all those things. how could i not? god: i'm sorry, but you just didn't try hard enough. back then it really meant something. and i suppose it still does today (other than me not really believing in this omnipresent biblical character). it just means that you should try your hardest to do the right thing. now all you have to do is work out what is the right thing. smiley"
948,sarc,"** nonsense. who's been teaching you your quantum physics?!? ** the reason is called, 'ex nihilo, nihil fit'. what you are saying is called 'magick'. ** which would mean that it came from some where or something and did not 'just happen'. ** a 'quantum fluxuation'(sic)?!? is that some kind of magical cosmological dump, or something?! materialists inventing magic words, or using real words as magical mantras and bumper stickers in oprder to make up for what they haven't got, is getting really old around here. ** so why not call your 'multiverse' , 'god', and be done with it?"
949,sarc,"so have the trillions of dollars that have already been 'redistributed upward' since the reagan/gramm deregulation mania helped end poverty? or has it created a dependent class of ultra rich people unable to function without a taxpayer bailout? that sword, my shonda friend, cuts both ways."

952,sarc,"miller case did nothing to defend the militia claim of the gun control people. the court ruled sawed off shot guns are not used in the military. if it had ruled people cannot own sawed off shot guns, then why can you still buy them?  does this also apply to the people that want gun control laws!? you know like when you said you hated inbred rednecks! why is it people that talk about talk about tolerance are the least tolerant people? practice what you preach!"
953,sarc,lol...well why don't you use your brain and tell me how and why breasts formed then. why would they get selected for in the first place? ns can't see into the future. have any evidence of a reptile with breasts?
954,sarc,"tendencies.  whether it is ok to act upon a 'tendency' may depend upon whether the outcome of that activity is favorable or not. we have lots more tendencies, like kindness, generosity, playfulness. these are good ones. why is it you lumped 'homosexuality, violence, alcohol/substance abuse' together? the last two are mostly bad things, but 'one of those things is not like the other'. homosexuality is just as good or bad as blue eyes or lefthandedness. we all have a 'tendency' toward sexual behavior that aligns with our sexual orientation. heteros 'tend' to want to do it with the opposite sex and homos with the same sex. i am not sure i understand your point here."
955,sarc,"steve if i thought i could help you i would. i was called on using incorrect facts and your shooting out words like bagillion? you need to know when you in a dream. reality is scary i understand that.  i can't make a blind man see steve, if i could i would. seems you can't make an aware man sleep as well."
956,sarc,"ask yourself why siblings marrying shouldn't be totally legal under all circumstances if the religious right has their way with an amendment stating that marriage is between a man and a woman. funny how the same 'argument' can be used just as easily against you, isn't it? sorry, archie, but it's called the slippery slope fallacy for a reason. the fact that you continue to use fallacies in your arguments really doesn't help whatever positive reputation you have left on this board.  even jyoshu, who agrees to not having gay marriage just as you do has argued against your fallacious arguments. and thanks, by the way, jyoshu for showing some strenght in character in your post criticising archies hate-filed posts. suprisingly that give me a lot of respect for you."
957,sarc,"it's actually not a fundie site, it is a catholic site, tradition in action. in the 'about us': not exactly where i would first think of looking for information about human sexuality.  but that's me. hey, arch, have you ever considered getting scientific information from a scientific source??? just a thought."
958,sarc,"doh, you used the 'l' word. how dare ye! (tsk, tsk) :p don't you know? you can't use the term 'lifestyle,' you have to use the description of lifestyle instead. that usually works much better. gotta know the rules to talk with the gay rights folk here, don't ya know? lol see, if you use the word, they can't stay on topic and so then your use of the 'l' word becomes the topic. it's just too damn distracting for 'em."
959,sarc,"two reasons: first, i come from a jewish family, and i've never heard of this before. now, i'll grant that nothing says that i should have, but this is news to me. second, and more importantly, trebor is not the person who made the positive claim; you are. it is your burden of proof. no one here can blame me for questioning your bare assertions given your history with falsehoods. so if he doesn't respond in a mere three hours, you declare victory? how about you call me presumptuous again? emoticonxrolleyes for once you acknowledge that you aren't able to back up your claim. congratulations. try it next time without accusing somebody of being cowardly and misleading."
960,sarc,"i tell ya what, move 100 lightyears from earth, now look at it with a telescope. see anything made by man, computers for example? human bodies? ok now come back to earth and look at where you were. see any bodies, any computers, any life? well do ya?"
961,sarc,"fend not really. they took it out because it was a blatant pro-christian argument.  and those two threads only serve to prove my point. the only iders are fundamentalists christians or muslims. there is no science in id. only godiddit.  explain to me how the same processes that date geological areas that are used by evolution and the big fossil fuel corporations is wrong.  explain to me how its correct when the fossil fuel industry uses it to find fossil fuels but when scientists use it to support evolution, it's false. that makes no sense whatsoever.  explain to me why something tried and true needs to be reformatted. or are all these products science brought us fake?  the delusion of creation."
962,sarc,"lol, really jim? you mean, all a gov't has to do is pass a bill in its legislature and it justifies whatever actions they undertake outside its borders? sweet. i'm gonna start lobbying today to get a bill passed through the house of commons, the 'jim's trucking liberation act'. once it's passed, i'll be completely legally justified in taking all that you have, by force if necessary. i'll start there, but if that goes well, i might aim for the 'usa liberation act', i wouldn't mind having a few vacation properties in the good ol' us of a. i can see all my fellow canadians really getting on board with this too, it's so easy, and only requires a stroke of the pen! waxy"
963,sarc,"ooh lucy herself. so tell me, just out of curiosity, how do they know how much hair to put on her life size image? i notice she isn't that furry at all. how'd they figure that out from just a few bones? let's see, what do they call people like you at the carnival booths? oh that's right, an easy mark. have you read any other good fairy tales lately pandion, besides lucy that is."
964,sarc,if i say murder is ok and you say it should be illegal the do i get to call you a bigot? you need to read the post better. i said if it can be changed then it is not innate. you said that skin color can be changed and it was innate. well you have yet to show how this is true. you saying it is about as equal as me saying you are wrong. i read 'environmental factors'...it doesn't say what this equates to and you have not shown where it does. there is no fact being voted on...only public policy.
965,sarc,"honk! wrong. my parents inherited a house from their parents. they also inherited knowledge and were taught certain values. concepts stored in one brain, expressed via words and encoded in a new brain. epigenetic inheritance, yet still materialistic. doesn't mean they didn't also inherit a bunch of genes, and for the umpteenth time it doesn't mean they get to screw their face up like hiro and tweak them whenever they like. shouldn't i be asking you that, since that's what you say happens, despite having exactly zero evidence to back it up? honk! what a great big fat juicy lie, ss. don't put it in the keep net though; toss it back so you can use it again later."
966,sarc,"not to mention his world view which believes math is atheism. remember, it was tq who based him on his inability to do math and arch replied directly that t.q's worldview was atheistic.  i do find it funny how someone who thinks that grammar is dependent upon the person saying a statement rather than the statement is criticizing someone over spelling.  i think i'll intentionally misspell words and then capitalize the incorrect letters just to annoy him. maybe he'll finally get something right pointing out something i intentionally did wrong?  it is funny how arch can't respond to what i actually wrote.  disagree with arch in any way and you hate christianity and god. insane, but that's arch."
967,sarc,"dunno... feind seems to be a german surname. perhaps a feindslayer is someone who goes around killing people named feind? i'm happy being viewed as a fiend, however. not so easily slayed! ;)"
968,sarc,"hmm so all you guys have achieved is make a bad situation in iraq infinitely worse and you ask the reasons why the whole world hate you? go to iraq and ask the people there what do they think of you and take the whole class with you including the teacher. so how would you reign in the militias, what is your method the world would probably not approve of?"
969,sarc,"well, i wasn't looking to derail the conversation, but since you are... i will continue to point out these instances to you. they happen often enough that it shouldn't be hard. perhaps once you see how often these 'misunderstandings' occur, the one's where people say that you're delibertately misunderstanding them, you'll, i don't know, stop doing it so much? we'll see."
970,sarc,what part about 'what i am going to do is use my influence to convince politicians to pass common sense gun-control laws' do you not understand? can you understand plain english? i said nothing about personally going to your property and taking away your guns. suppose someone wanted the speed limit to be lowered. kelvin's argument against that would be like this- 'do you really believe that? do you really believe it so much that you would be willing to die for your belief? then run out in the middle of the road when you see a speeding car and hope that when the driver sees you he/she will slow down. don't ask anyone else to do it. risk your own life by running out in the middle of the road.'
971,sarc,"< yawn > you going to get to the topic or what? isn't there another thread you can create to talk about this 'issue' you are so fixated on? the only real 'non-interest' here is in you not even talking about what this thread is about. i have an interest in a variety of threads, and talk repeatedly on them on the actual subject matter. the fact that i say other things you object to on those threads is not a logical reason to conclude a lack of interest. also, considering i have challenged you to a moderated debate, which would obviously include somebody curbing any conduct that violates the rules, it would again show interest. the fact that you refuse to respond to such a challenge shows that you are the non-interested party. not me... emoticonxrolleyes"
972,sarc,"you sure fooled me about that!  well, actually, i have.  it's no more than a restatement and expansion of previous points i've already made.  well, you'll have to forgive my occasional rhetorical flourishes and hyperboles. not a few religious believers have exasperated me as total xxxxxx, but i do realise that not every believer in a religion is a total idiot... ;) that is a 'simple fact'? it doesn't seem so very simple to me, and i am not sure how you would establish it as a fact. but yes, i accept that most theists assume their god is eternal and not limited by the natural laws that limit them. i'm just dubious how rational an assumption it is."
973,sarc,business is a purely private association. you mean like interracial marriage? 'social harm' is just another term for 'things i personally find distasteful'.
974,sarc,"what? why should i have to prove that anything doesn't exist? i simply don't believe anything there's no evidence for. why should i have to prove that everything there is no evidence for doesn't exist? because a lot of it might hurt me? there's no evidence of an invisible pteratactyl behind my head about to eat my brain. do i need to prove it doesn't exist?  you must have have heard about the onus being on the person making an assertion to prove it, not the other way around. i could assert there's an invisible spaceship on my lawn. it leaves no imprint on the grass and you can walk right through it. now prove it doesn't exist, archangel. go on. prove it!"
975,sarc,"why am i not surprised at your lack of a response to my point? why am i not surprised that you're supplying no evidence? and there are millions of bedrooms with people gettin' busy inside, too. can we rail against those as well? in bed, with their partners. you're married and you still don't know where this generally happens?"
976,sarc,"so that means i can't call a godless heathen a godless heathen on a debate forum in the 21st century? do you see how ridiculous you sound? or is this bunk just par for the course for you people? of course we all know it is. you are all too happy to create 2 sets of rules here. it is just fine for you atheists to condemn everything i represent but if i as a believer in christ give the other side of the coin, i'm breaking some imaginary rules and going to hell? emoticonxgood emoticonxsmilie emoticonxsmilie emoticonxsmilie you all oughta be on stage jito, the first one outa town that is."
977,sarc,"since archie's posts are content free, might i suggest they be response free as well? he isn't here to debate or discuss or even explain; he's here to rant and insult. every response just gives him one more opening to do so, i ask that people stop giving him that opening. just my opinion of course, do as you will. it's just tedious seeing thread after thread driven off track and into the mud."
978,sarc,"we'd have define consensus first. if it is 50% + 1 then there probably is one. then after that, who is saying they are wrong? prejudice as its finest. lesz likes to stereotype people to an extreme that can never be changed. i have never told lesz my views on global warming and lesz has shown no interest in gathering facts about what others believe."
979,sarc,"are you telling me you cannot figure out how creating a gay-hostile atmosphere causes and condones anti-gay bullying? forsooth! butter wouldn't melt in your mouth, would it."
980,sarc,"by me, not 'lyte.  who said you're hateful to foreigners? i said you use that as an excuse to pooh-pooh away differing opinions, as in 'oh, you can't understand, you're not american.'. you've done it numerous times, but not always. as you should have. itwas done to show how illogical your 'common sense' reasons were for suspecting 'lyte and i were the same person. because we've used the same words and phrases occassionally, and because we tend to agree on most subjects, does not mean we are the same person. just as it doesn't mean you and aa are the same person. following me here marc? as does anyone who confuses 'lyte and i."
981,sarc,really? is the aaas a non-scientific organization too? hope you don't read the journal science because it isn't good enough for you.  you just choose to attack the source because it disagrees with your viewpoint. don't let science get in the way of your fanatic beliefs. emoticonxgood  if it isn't a peer-reviewed journal than why does it have to be reviewed by two experts in the field? why is the journal associated with the aaas? why do you attack the source and not offer one that supports your view? is it because you can't provide evidence for any claim you make or because you enjoy the taste of sand? keep digging that hole dane.
982,sarc,are you done spamming and threatening me with admin? that's just lame and pathetic.
983,sarc,"did someone hack your account, oblivious? you sound like a fsb bot in this post..."
984,sarc,"since your denying it so strenuously, i can only conclude you therefore support the right of gays to marry the partner of their choice and to enjoy the same benefits you and your spouse enjoy. or was there some other portion of my post that is contradictory to your beliefs? aw, how cute! archie learnt a new word: projecting. how is what i said 'projecting' archie?"
985,sarc,"are you always this reactive? short-sightedness. feasibility in terms of winning a nomination. but not necessarily a national election. and being suckered by the right into thinking that they actually like you -- because your health plan is more laissez-faire than clinton's ... meaning it's business as usual if you did win. but you won't. because we'll like any republican better. did you really think we were going to keep on saying nice things about you? my regards to your texas cousin, cnxtime. emoticonxgood  but i already know you pubbies are shakin' in your amarillo boots should hillary and the clinton machine be what you face instead come november. mccain, born '36 clinton, born '47 obama, born '61"
986,sarc,"your last post? this one: so, let me get this straight-you're evidence that the toe is based on lies and deceptions is: 1) you said it's based on lies and deceptions; 2) you know better; (those first two are my favorites, btw) 3) it's based on unprovable assumptions (which you've never managed to provide, despite numerous requests to do so); 4) it's constantly changed as new data emerges (i'll just point out here that that is how all science works) yep, i'm convinced. oh, not that you're right, but that you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. i'm also convinced that my previous post was correct in what you define a 'lie' as."
987,sarc,"this is called extremist logic. first of all sams cost millions of dollars and people who can afford them probably can't afford that many, secondly these rich d00ds probably like thier freedom and would not be so inclined to use them. 3rdly how many individuals do you know can afford a billion dollar nuclear arms program and build, posses, and maintain a nuclear weapon? this is absurd rationing from the land of make believe.  but to answer your question if the government can own it so should the people."
988,sarc,"look around, the greatest majority of gun-related violence occurs were people aren't allowed to be armed, or have to go through great leaps and bounds to qualify for being armed. this is because the criminals who get their guns illegally and plans to use them to harm others know that their chances of encountering an armed victim are next to nothing, putting them in an near-absolute position of authority where they can do whatever they want. and the point is what exactly in this statement? last i checked thailand and israel were arming school teachers because too many students were either being held hostage or murdered. after the teachers became armed these rates dropped. why? because schools were no longer soft targets and threats could be met with deadly force immediately within a second's notice."
989,sarc,"because gc hears things all woggly. the message from god is for shepherds to tend to ignorant, mindless sheep. but, with dope-smoker ears, and american ignorance it translates into a cowboy...who rustles cattle...and heads them to a quick slaughter. it's like, when the anti-chist makes his appearance, i'll be gods slaughterman. effectively and efficiently removing tru-believahs from the world...cause god forgot some in his rapture thingy (i forget how the logic of these events is supposed to play out...) ummm...aren't we overdue for that bloke to return already? i'm getting antsy for the 2nd coming and all the excitement that leads up to that glorious event. think holding my breath will make it happen any sooner?"
990,sarc,"'define'? as if it's a definition? tell me, archie: precisely how ignorant of this topic are you? so you want me to give you the better part of what could amount to a semester-long advanced college course in a single post? do you really think that you'll understand curvature of space-time as induced by matter when you can't even understand the difference between a scientific theory and a drunken guess? do you really think i have any inclination of trying to tell you about the technicalities of relativity when you don't understand that light and gamma rays are the same thing? get real. you need to get your head out of your xxx before you'll be able to even hear me."
991,sarc,"you're not a bigot, all gays really are 'touchy, judgmental and bitchy'? classic! seriously, debate over, archie loses in one. obviously archie won't see it that way, but does anyone else disagree?"
992,sarc,"wonder where all our resident hypocrisy-police people are who jump up and cry 'hypocrisy!!!' whenever a 'family-values guy' messes up? funny, they don't seem to be so eager to call out hypocrisy in this case ...."
993,sarc,"none of them which are correct.  how about you address my points? oh wait, you won't because you need to maintain your fantasy land where everyone who disagrees with you is an atheist.  how can you attack me when you won't even read the links given to you?"
994,sarc,"got anything more than your opinion that proves scientifically that the athletes will be completely safe and breathing pristine air with the factories shut down 2 weeks before the games start, and only half the cars taken off the road each day? i mean, it took a decade or more before the la basin declared victory over the dangerous pollutants that prevented asthmatics from going outside on certain days after we attacked the same problem back in the 70s. so don't you think it's a tad naive to think everything will be honky dory after 2 short weeks with these limited actions? and don't forget the neighbors the link mentions and their unending pollutants that will continue to come in on those same winds."
995,sarc,"could it be that they've finally realized that there is no viable argument for gun control in a country that was built on freedom to bear arms? each time the control-lobby comes up with an argument....they get shot to pieces. (laugh out loud!) it is interesting to note that both of the democratic front-runners for 2008 favor gun control. with the recent death of charlton heston, there's a weakness in the armor of the nra. i would go on a handgun buying spree, but i already have enough guns and ammo to stave off a thousand or so government guntakers at a place we call 'the little alamo'."
996,sarc,"as to the first part, i answered you above. regarding the second part; what in the world are you talking about? girls who are born from unfertilized eggs? and boys born of virgin mothers? can you post any evidence of these cases? beside jesus of course, because we know his father is god and that he possesses the holy spirit."
997,sarc,"have you ever even heard of www.google.com? http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=...e+search&meta= and this is your measure of what makes something true? well then, the epic of gilgamesh, the illiad, and the oddysey must also be true by that reasoning. they've survived just as long, and are still being studied to this day for their insights into those ancient cultures."
998,sarc,"are you completely incapable of making sense? penfold used deliberately obtuse language. this language was then explained to you. now you are arguing that 'turn the other cheek' is completely different, and in no way similar, to 'revolve/rotate' the other cheek. if you turn something, you revolve or rotate it. you're so busy being affronted by what people say that you come off as even more simple than they try to make you appear."
999,sarc,"so a ballot initiative that allowed the citizens of the state to vote on the issue was illegal?!?!? what dictatorship do you live in that makes a ballot initiative unconstitutional? oh yeah, i forgot, the district of whatever the poor oppressed gay militants want. so screw the will of the people, just buy the judges and rule through judicial activism."
1000,sarc,do you think i would lie to you? http://panasonic.net/pavc/lumix/line_up/slr.html nice photos!
1001,sarc,"shooterandproud: hey, here's a novel idea, what about the man using contraception!?! don't tell me there are men so ignorant in this country that they don't know what the trojan dispenser in the men's bathroom is for!"
1002,sarc,"but it makes you look a fool that you make comments without knowing. doesn't it. so you think that just because you enter a debate half-way, you can still give an uninformed opinion? weren't you the one ready to laugh at me? i won't laugh at you. i am only saddened by your personal attacks. yes, repeating yourself. i know what they say, you know what they say. i don't agree with them, on these points. answers in genesis are 'right' by your account on this occasion - see my previous post about us both being 'selective' in the information we use; again a lack of insight into your own thought processes. i disagree with them. do you agree with their claim that speciation in fact disproves evolution? i bet you've been very selective here too!"
1003,sarc,"and what alternate fuel source do you reccommend, o divine oracles? i'd like to see something cheaper in my lifetime. so how long will it take to find something 'better'?"

1005,sarc,bwhahaaa....this is unreal. precrime? seriously? minority report? and guns magically turn people into 'bad guys'? hum...good to know. and its funny: we will remove the temptation of a lethal weapon by enforcing new laws via our own lethal weapons.  you people are freaking retarded.
1006,sarc,"are there doctrines of red hair? 1.so now you can spew your filth about the 'evils' of christianity, but i can't say anything about atheism? when did atheism become so great? at least i'm corteous enough not to shout it out to the world. but there seems to be no way in atheism that you would be that corteous. emoticonxwow"
1007,sarc,"oh really? maybe in canada that'll fly, but that isn't what quotation marks mean down here. but of course you lefties just write the rules as you go and expect the rest of us to automatically get it, huh? no tq, all he had to say was 'so called christ killers' if that's what he meant to say. he was making an absolute statement and he was attributing it to what christians believe. it was hateful, bigoted and prejudicial against the jews. not to mention inaccurate as the crucifixion was a uniquely roman form of execution. so don't make excuses for him, you degrade yourself to lie for someone like him who just attacks christians without thinking."
1008,sarc,he screamed and insulted and threw his literature at the vice president of pride. and you once again snipet and reword my posts by taking them out of context to serve your own irrational and bigoted thought process. oh and dont accuse your community? what are you some holy leader? get off of your self rightous high horse and get a clue! and how is my community rising above your 'communities' bigotry and and slander? by having pride movements like these and standing up for ourselves.
1009,sarc,"maybe david just wanted to participate in some slaughtering too? anyway. the commandment says 'to not covet your neighbors ***.' most of my neighbors have hairy ones so it's easy not to covet them. well, there's that and the fact that i'm no gay... but, there are a couple of opposing gender neighbors who's back sides i do covet. does that mean i should get killeded? oh, wait...when they said ***, they meant mule/donkey like animal? huh. whodathunkit? shoulda kept it in it's original language then.  i guess it's okay for me to covet christina's rump? since she's not married and all. just so long as she doesn't covet mine...cause i am. emoticonxangel"
1010,sarc,"yes. probably because they're not using chi right. about the boxer, i don't really know. however, i have seen people use chi in other ways. how would you explain the stunts that my master does sometimes? the whole standing on one leg thing, or the rebar thing? i know its not a trick, so what is it? i didn't think finger muscles were capable of bending rebar."
1011,sarc,query: why do they call the followers of gush limpbutt the addict 'dittoheads'? answer: they have no ideas of their own. think gush & cindy have the same supplier?  now there's a capitalist we all can admire!!

1014,sarc,i don't live in either place easy and last time i checked it was now a barren plain.... wippy things i'll say? that was quoted from your messiah! the one person that you claim saves the worlds sins! and now that you are reminded of such a teaching you say it is i who twist things? no easy you just choose to believe what you want... as far as the coming wrath you speak of. people from john to the cult of waco have been preaching the impending 'wrath' for over 2000 years..... i choose not to flee for this so called 'wrath' or scare tactic you implore about oh you'll be sorry if you don't pander to my views idiocy. instead i face in squarely and will confront your hypocrisy on every level...
1015,sarc,"ooooo am i supposed to be concerned at anything you have to say? you're a blowhard delusional wannabe christian who doesn't understand your own claimed religion, how can your word hold any meaning."
1016,sarc,"my hat is off to california! was my post #43 right or wrong? now we just need new york to follow suit. now my question. if the federally funded programs can not create new stem cell lines, can california create them and then share? voila! federal funding on useful research. then watch 'em all stand in line for the cure. another question. has anybody else thought to ask gwb why, if stem cell research is false hope, did he fund any of it -- badly?"
1017,sarc,really? i never miss the chance to tell everyone that i'm going to heaven? i challenge you to quote me ever bragging that i'm going to heaven and you're not. what i have done is promised you mockers and scoffers that the day will come when you will learn the truth about how wrong you are to reject the living god. but never have i boasted that i am going to heaven while you're not. and never has my motivation for promising you that you will ultimately learn the truth been to make such a point. so quote my posts kronus. prove me wrong and defend your lying claim. and i want links to posts in context to the debate and point being made at the time.
1018,sarc,"yep. and look at those goalposts flying across the field: so we go from showing where he ever did this to showing where he did it five times. and if five examples are provided? well, show me ten! and if ten are provided, he'll want at least half of his post count (roughly 2500). why? the point has been made, the challenge he himself laid out has been met. still waiting for the proof i'm lying archie. want to head on back to that other thread and show where i lied?"
1019,sarc,"i know i'm presenting facts to archie, sorry... archie, in point of fact you have it backwards. the theory of evolution was first, then abioegenesis. we know life exists. darwin, and others, explained how life changed from what it used to be to what it is now; they had no concern for where it came from in the first place, they simply knew that it came from somewhere. how did they know it came from somewhere? because there's life here now! the answer to the question of where it all started didn't get seriously studied until well after darwin. so no, the one does not pick up from the other, and the study of evolution does not in any way depend on abiogenesis. evolution doesn't care where life came from, only what happens to it once it's around."
1020,sarc,"oh sure, try to take the high road now. but have you forgotten the labels you have so freely placed on us as supporters of mcstain, as you have labeled him? does the term pulling a kronus mean anything to you? because you define it with posts like this, as you now seek to ditch the offensive labels like this: (hard right religious radical fringe) http://www.4forums.com/political/sho...ain#post322462. and this: http://www.4forums.com/political/sho...t321807emoticonxgood"
1021,sarc,"ah, not a problem then i read up on that rev. wright affair, and it looked to me like it was spun pretty hard. if by racist american hating nut you mean 'black guy who's tired of blacks being discriminated against and says the system needs to change', then yeah, i see your point. that's my interpretation of what he was saying, and not a subject for discussion here though. i know it's politics, but is winning more important than what's best for the country? ouch. but wouldn't it be better to have someone in there who at least knows that's how far there understanding goes and doesn't presume to know more than the people who spend their lives studying these subjects? gotcha. glad it was that one ;)"
1022,sarc,but they lack evidence as to why a first trimester fetus should be considered a 'being'. they want to change the law based on metaphysical claims attached to their religion. why don't we make it illegal to work on sunday while we're at it. and why not saturday too? and enough with the bacon already (just for good measure).
1023,sarc,"yes, as it was used in the correct context such that it made sense (referring to a bill/legislation that was being passed.  obama did not use it correctly and it was quite clear he was using it to insult palin. especially when another of his buddies in missouri on the same day made a direct mention of palin and used 'lipstick' in a same manner (said mccain was trying to cover up his 'deficiencies' but even his vp pick couldn't do it no matter how much lipstick they covered it with). hardly a coincidence, wouldn't you say? personally i see obama coming down from that high horse he has claimed to be on and has started getting dirty now that for the first time he is behind in the national polls."
1024,sarc,"you're somehow right despite the fact that all reliable evidence is on our side? what idiocy. brady, this is the most ignorant thing you've said yet. some of the stuff you bolded supports us, not you. and the rest does no good for you either."
1025,sarc,"are you one of the hard of understanding people? flyboy got it, even if his rationalisations were insufficient. even so, they were far superior to much of the dross you regurgitate."
1026,sarc,"you think metro is left wing? what the hell have you been smoking, ethmi? metro is a filthy rag from the same hideous stable as the daily mail."
1027,sarc,"no... a debased intellect has things backwards, that would clearly be minds of your ilk buddy. so.. what then? your heart tells you to go jump off a cliff? on contrast that old you book you claim tells me to sit down and live a day, guess what i'm gonna do? go live a day... and avoid watching them have to scrape you off the ground. that old book is about reason, respect, love decency and standards that preserve life... a fallen heart cannot be trusted. i trust a heart governed by that book... rather than a mind with no self control living for the 'heart' - they give heart a bad name. sorry pal... i dont' expect you to understand it, and i am fine with that - it is your choice, but it hasn't been wrong ever, and never wronged anybody."
1028,sarc,nice thought. a pity you did not live in the third reich. emoticonxfrazzled if they were captured in the battlefield then they should be treated according to the geneva convention.  and if they were found in a hole then why did you remove from there? and please tell us of the 'intelligence' they supplied the only 'intelligence' they supplied was to be used in how to perfect techniques in torturing in which medical doctors participated just as the doctors in nazi germany. doctors are creepy.
1029,sarc,"thanks for the admission that you lied. btw, some of you think that mcstain gave up nothing of importance after being tortured in north vietnam. if that be the case, how can you be sure that any of the iraqis who were waterboarded or tortured in other ways gave up anything valuable? wait, i have it, the americans are better at torture than anyone else. sick!!!"
1030,sarc,"bs, if it's password protected, then how would they access it? then i suppose america would look lovely as the crater in the death star! you're telling me to believe that it exists even though there is no evidence that it does? once again: there's a witness in this courtroom who says that i didn't kill that guy, but i'm the only one who can see him and hear him. in other words, unless the page is showed to me, i have no reason to believe that it exists."
1031,sarc,so a vote for an adulterous divorcee is a vote for morality? is this election being held in wonderland? i'm pretty sure mccain falls foul on bearing false witness as well.
1032,sarc,"do you seriously mean to suggest that the entire campaign, election, and inauguration would have taken place under the scrutiny of the world without this vital discovery being made? if so, it looks as though you and phelps both set bells to ringing when you pass by. the bells say, 'bong, bong, bong!!"
1033,sarc,"by changing the subject. just because you reply doesn't mean you don't change the subject. i could reply with gibberish. you apparently missed the post where you claimed that creationwiki had refuted talkorigins. as talkorigins supports the toh, and since you think that that to is incorrect, well, you do the math.  do you know what a question is? in the english langauge, a question is meant to gain clarification. my question clearly did not accuse you of saying such, only requesting clarification to whether or not you believed creationists used dishonest tactics. perhaps you should enroll in a english comprehension course at your local college?  see above. google is a good tool for finding such classes.  keep insulting me. not only will it get you warnings, but it keeps proving my point.  you have no argument. only insults."
1034,sarc,"to review. we have this piece of wonderful news stating that we cannot keep illegal products out of the country, and we should just give up and quit.    major panel: drug war failed; legalize marijuana  new jobs program by sinjin for the mexican drug cartels. inport illegal guns in too.    and this news from a country much like ours.   australia. with much much more gun control than you want at this particular moment, and they still have the illegal gun problem.  and yet you still insist on laying this off on our constitution? the probability of success is zero, and you know it! so what is your real reason for burdening the constitution? ooooo! ooooo! i know! you dont like it!  isnt that what you told charlie?"
1035,sarc,"what about all of the school killings that have involved use of revolvers, shotguns, and ieds? what's your p***ing away excuse for instances like these? in reality school shootings are linked to them being target rich environments where nobody can mount any opposition to the deranged killer. it's like a wolf in the chicken coop."
1036,sarc,"you do know that it is a) easy to register and b) the site admin is a christian, don't you? you won't go there because the moderation is strict about sticking to the topic and insults. these things seem to be part of your weapon load out, here."
1037,sarc,"welcome to creationistland, where chemical reactions can't be explained or predicted unless we know the origin of the atoms involved. do these people check the labels of all of their food before they eat so that the fruit from bulgaria actually has an impact on their bodies? must be a problem to eat at a restaurant. 'excuse me, sir, but can you tell me where this chicken was raised? if you don't tell me, then i won't get any protein from it.'"
1038,sarc,"i would ask you for a link, but this time i'm not feeling generous.  didn't you know that there are about 2.5 million cases of gun self defence annually, in about 92% of those cases nobody was harmed? does this even compare to the microscopic 102,200 deaths (don't tell me that's, wrong thats the very number that your cult has been using, comrade) that the brady fanatics have been whining about? your stats are simply untrue."
1039,sarc,"how is pointing out that terms can be misapplied an indication of contradiction?!? we are always free to disregard the standard of application for a term. that doesn't mean that such usage is correct. and in fact, the idea of a correct usage presupposes that the standard is something non-subjective. perhaps of the two of us, i'm not the one who misunderstood what i wrote? and yet, they're not. infants have been born; fetuses have not. because birth is the dividing line. how often does it need to be said?"
1040,sarc,"as steve martin once said, 'well, ecuuuuuuse meeeee'. no polar icecaps today? ok what is the proper - pc terminology - that refers to the big chunk of ice, what sits over the top of the north and south regions of the planet? as long as it is not too long of a description or too lame - i can evolve to the next phase and say ...(thus and such)... instead. :) btw. iam sure that algore can remember the meaning of - 'polar icecaps'. sorry that, you can not."
1041,sarc,"so is matthew your friggin' loon!  are you really that far gone that you can't see the point that everyone here is trying to drill through that thick brainwashed skull of yours? all any of your posts boil down to is 'i'm right because i can't be wrong'. what utter bs. and the sad thing is, you have absolutely no idea. you are utterly incapable of viewing things from another perspective. you can't even understand the possibility that there is another perspective."
1042,sarc,"i'm not 'claiming victory' after going off track to an unrelated topic. what i am addressing is related because i am saying it is irrelevant. how is that not related? in fact, this is another example of you changing the subject matter. to point out that they are irrelevant. i thought that was clear."
1043,sarc,where did jesus get his magic powers from? btw if angels could do the baby mama drama before the flood then god can too.
1044,sarc,"oh, so business owners don't make 'real' contributions to society? whoa boy, slow down there. i didn't say that government offices should be passed down. what are you going to do...make inheritence illegal? you didn't read my answer obviously. just because people have money doesn't mean they have to share it. the government doesn't have the right to take money away from the rich and give it to the poor. so what if rich people don't give money to the poor! it's their choice. god tells us to give money to the poor, but he also gave us a free will. it's not the governments responsibility to help the poor, it's the church's responsibility."
1045,sarc,"quick objection to the movie analogy: that analogy holds true when god takes the role of the observer, as you might in a movie. but what if he wrote the script? he wrote all your lines and you played your part perfectly. then he gets to watch it. no free will there."
1046,sarc,"what a pitiful quotation. is there something that you try to achieve with that? you're attempting to say that all who are christian are illogical, which i find just plain silly. are you not aware of the great minds who proclaimed their belief in god? plus, is that the image you want to portray for yourself? what a great person who slanders of religions. the great atheist himself! could you explain why you think that?"
1047,sarc,"making sweeping judgments against homosexuals and atheists, with no real knowledge of their situation? archie has no problem. but when it comes to christianity, the obfuscational ploy of 'i don't know all the details' comes out, followed promptly by a thorough lack of concern for finding out any additional details. she is blatantly violating her religion in doing so. the bible lays out exclusive reasons for 'divorce'. this isn't one of them. this is yet another example of religious intolerance, even to the extent of violating their own religion."
1048,sarc,"imagine that! missiles machine guns and grenades. i cannot buy missiles, machine guns are strictly regulated, and grenades? does a class 3 license cover grenades? if it does, all the mexican government has to do is supply the u.s. with the serial number and bam! the criminal is busted! however, wayne lapierre from the nra, and chris cox said in congressional testimony said that the mexican government will not give the u.s. serial numbers.    cnn parrots mexican claims that u.s. guns fuel drug wars  "
1049,sarc,"this may have been posted already. i didn't want to read the 3 pages of drivel from rosegone08. makes my head hurt. are there really people like that? by the way, is that a swastika arm band on your avatar? anyway, as always, that brilliant pundit and great american, steven colbert, delivers his insight on this 'gathering storm' issue: there's a storm gathering! i am afraid.... 'remember, when the gay community is granted personal freedoms, ours get taken away. how? shhhhh..... did you see all that lightning?'"
1050,sarc,why aren't the iraqi's who killed them held responsible? do you currently hold john kennedy responsible for the deaths in vietnam? what about korea? who was responsible for the deaths there? wwii? how about the revolutionary war?  that bad ol' george washington. killin' all those poor colonists.
1051,sarc,"how do they know the speed of light was the same? how do they know that things travel backward in time. is this temporal swap local to the reference frame of the object, or globally observable? and i was asking if you've got an experiment with colliders showing altered causality. you bet, but you can't know they are different because no argument from our era would hold? how do you even know these two realms you've imagined even have a time dimension? now that you've taken us on a lovely circuit could you please show a sound argument that is false for any point in time."
1052,sarc,"typical pro-life, woman-hating schmuck. i am pro-choice so i must be selfish whore who aborts all the time. you aren't worth the energy it takes to type.  i'm sure its no greater than your own. i mean, only a scarred woman could want autonomy, right? real women should be door mats, that way you don't ever have to attempt being a real man. way way over the line. he is an amazing, committed, loving, amazing father. maybe you, like my ex-husband, think being father is about who you ####. and like him, you probably think thats also where it ends as well. both myself and my son's adopted (real) father have higher standards than that."
1053,sarc,"lol. says the one who did not even bother to open the specific post link.  huh. again, you don't care about evidence. i gave it to you and you said i never did despite the link to the specific post right there.  liar you call me? well, i guess it takes one to know one.  questionable. all that the author did was state that the evidence rejects yec. he does not argue for another form of creationism.  please stop trying to argue there is only one form of creationism.  my god you are dishonest. still avoiding why arch would replace yec with christanity eh?  apparently you think interchangeability means that the words mean two different things despite being used interchangeably as the same."
1054,sarc,"what? naaah,... all we have to do is deny the suspects are 'persons' then we can do any emoticonxcensored thing we want to with them and there's no moral aspects to it at all,... just like abortion and (at one time) slavery. one thing that has always puzzled me,... 'how is it that enemy combatants and convicted murderous terrorists can come away with more rights and sympathy from the left than a prebirth little human child can?' (scratching head) emoticonxconfused how is it that a leftist can see more outcries for humanity in a whale, dolphin, spotted owl or field mouse than they do in an actual prebirth human child? one of the great mysteries of the modern world, i suppose."
1055,sarc,"'we all die' of course we do i do not understand the point of that silly remark. if we don't, then please let us know. free will means (to me) i have a choice to do something or not to do. most important, i accept responsibility for my choice your little comment about dreaming/believeing, does that mean the human race is never going to develop ? then you carry on dreaming. people make their own mess. it is up to them to clean up their act. don't try and evade responsibility"
1056,sarc,"another question that shouild be answered is . . . if the bible says that noah and a few members of his family were the only ones to survive this 'global' flood, how come there are so many other accounts of others surviving a flood? did god miss the target (that being the whole of humanity)? genesis 6:13 (new international version) 13 so god said to noah, 'i am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. i am surely going to destroy both them and the earth. presumably he also knew from the beginning of time that he was going to make this great big ####-up. how embarrassing!"
1057,sarc,"emoticonxrolleyes jyoshu, i have addressed your reply on the issue. predictably, you dodged it. ignoring the hypocrisy of your position. http://www.4forums.com/political/gay...tml#post357931 adding on to that, you allege 'serves the gay pride movement right' with no explanation... is it just cause p hilton mouthed off vilely that millions more 'deserve' something??? if you want to discuss the issue, you can start there... that would be rather contradictory with your earlier statement of 'serves the gay pride movement right'... emoticonxrolleyes and how has the 'movement' conducted itself here? my complaint is typically about the action itself. here, you have made it personal..."
1058,sarc,"oh hank, you really are funny. the way you are changing. i simply made a statement that it was one of many posts that you have agreed on. that was the post you disputed. are you still near all those paint-fumes? it must be the rotational affect of the egg-shaped world you live on! :) as i said... how simple is that? it is one that you've agreed on, and you now agree that it's one of several that you've agreed on. what is your point?  i made a statement that you now agree on. you raised an objection, you even say that everyone knows what you said, excepting me. how have i demonstrated i don't understand you? i haven't disputed your original statement. i made a complimentary statement."
1059,sarc,"how are you proving that when you have gone out of your way to ignore your failures?  tell me, does comic book art prove creationism? does tv props prove creationism? is oil a hydrocarbon? is density sorting in a fluid medium 'ludicrous?' does a theory that requires miracles work on a scientific level?  how is 'why' the same as 'what?' and since when does grammar depend on the person saying it rather than the statement being said? you claimed that taz did not screw up the grammar, yet i did. yet the statements were identical. how are you addressing what i said when you've completely ignored everything i listed?  more yelling. no actual argument.  the whole point of that was to show you make large numbers of asinine statements. do you reject that?  red bold statements don't make a winning argument."
1060,sarc,"ummmmmmm, because it was built in 1932-1935, and has nothing whatsoever to do with the founders or early government leaders, nor with what they believed was correct? you really are the master of the art of self-pwn, archie."
1061,sarc,why waste more time on your follies? you're in automatic denial anyway.  john 3:36
1062,sarc,"and mythology. you forgot mythology. for example, the two stories of creation were probably two popular folk myths. and the story of the flood is actually two versions of the myth that are intermixed. and, of course, the stories of job and of jonah are pure mythology. do you know what logic is? comparing the moral mythology of noah to a parable is an analogy, not logic. the myths of noah are not history. and since we are talking about noah, i see you bailed on the thread where the pyramids of egypt were being discussed. and yet you refer to this obvious myth as history."
1063,sarc,jos 24:15? what book of the bible is that? i thought i knew the names of all the books of the bible used by protestants but i don't recognize jos.
1064,sarc,"be sure and count the number of hits vs. the number of misses of some well trained leos. sap, remember your postition you took now on citizens might miss and hit some innocent person? read 3 or 4 versions of this shootout and learn something! lots of useful information in there."
1065,sarc,is that the best you can do simone? i think the games up for you old girl! i used to do volunteer work for the samaritans in england and we had a few callers like you. it sometimes takes a while to suss out a fantasist but you do eventually!
1066,sarc,"what agenda do people wanting to prevent infanticide have, exactly? you're the ones with the agenda, the 'right' just wants to stop killing our progeny. emoticonxrolleyes"
1067,sarc,"'glenn beck asks are dems building a master race' no he didn't... you've been complaining about strawmen lately, now you're building them. hypocrisy much? i demand you retract your statements, take responsibility for them and apologise to glenn beck. i further charge that your attack is motivated by race hatred."
1068,sarc,are you clear as to what you are questioning here? or just kicking up dust? sounds like a are you still beating your live in lover type of question from the gunners seat.
1069,sarc,"your foot would do service as a colander. in australia, a weapon may be legally held for many reasons. self defence is not one of them. you might legally own a weapon for sport shooting, but use it to defend yourself. how hard is that to understand? for a supposed 'expert' not to realise that a drawn pistol is not pointing at ones foot, is a major error commonly made by fantasy gunners."
1070,sarc,"not true at all. hate crime legislation protects straights as well as gays. nothing 'special' there. so you make a claim, but can provide no example to document the veracity of your claim. meh... what i expected. the ruling is garbage. 'ex-gays' are supposedly straight, right? so they are already protected under existing legislation. if we had a bunch of democrats who changed to republicans, and then insisted they should be known as 'ex-democrats', would we need another legal status for them? no."
1071,sarc,"and jyoshu is in full cheer-leader mode... what the heck did i supposedly back-peddle on? please. be explicit. no wait. you're not going to answer that, are you... roflmao! symbiote runs around proclaiming all sorts of things (falsely) as my supposed hypothesis, and you pretend that me refusing to take up her strawman approach is somehow 'back-peddling'? more like the blind leading the blind, walking in circles and thinking they are travelling quickly! as for proof, do you understand what 'hypothesis' means in the first place? look it up."
1072,sarc,"there was no ccw in texas at the time, that law she got passed was the ccw law that ma richards refused to sign, she would rather burn women and children in the davidian church and illegally allow violation of posse commitatus and allowing other state guards into texas. you 9 years old now, mentally? the cafeteria had no policy such as you mention. there was a law enforcement convention going on right next door and they were unaware of it so more proof that cops can't protect you! emoticonxcensored"
1073,sarc,"did someone repeal freedom of beliefs in this country while i wasnt looking. if i told you i talked to satan last night, would you think i needed to be committed?  have i made it any secret that i dont believe the supernatural parts of the bible? same reason i quote anyone. does that matter? since you seem to know more about my beliefs than i do, could you explain why you came to this conclusion. thats your privilege.  my wife worships me. that doesnt mean im a god. lol what does that mean? obviously. what? you're entitled to your insignificant opinion. :) what?"
1074,sarc,"so the old man was doing something criminal by carrying a firearm for self defence? the bar***d! how can you do such a thing, breaking the law like that, or maybe if the criminal who beat him up was the one who actually deserved to be charged, or better shot. so you think that this man who was following the law (texas case) deserved to go to jail for defending his property and anybody else who may have been hurt, killed as a result of their next crime? are you actually insane? have you lost your marbles? what is wrong with you?"
1075,sarc,gee our reasoning challenged one has shown up. let me see we have a ny slimes article on the problems liberals have caused in children. then we leap to they never grow up. and then the leap to they get guns. wonder what study or studies back that up? from there we go into male hatred mode via hormones. of course these are all white kids too eh? not to mention being of the republican persuation no doubt. 
1076,sarc,"you're hopeless. what do you thing a stable website in which only authorized personnel have access to would be considered in layman's terms? answer: a secure website.emoticonxbangheademoticonxbanghead i already cited the section of the bill that backs up my statement above, so don't bother trying to refute it."
1077,sarc,"talk about proving you're a dedicated evolutionist by making yet one more massive assumption to add to your religion of evolution, how about you prove this absolute statement which you are so boldly making while offering no proof at all of it? but hey, paulie; you really impressed tq, so you're doing well with simpletons. emoticonxgood"
1078,sarc,"so your personal complaint is that i use smilies... how thoroughly underwhelming! you know dude? i don't waste any time trying to picture who you are... there are issues to discuss. and that is a lot more interesting than imagining what other people on this forum look like... if i were to spend time trying to picture you, i guess i would picture somebody who thinks wayyy too much of themselves (with wayyy too little of a reason to) and gets easily distracted by punctuation... can i make a suggestion? if you can't get anything out of the post, do not respond. quite frankly, that's the easiest and most sensible thing to do."
1079,sarc,"so jesus was gun toting right winger ? emoticonxkill if leftists oppose an armed society then it follows that nazis did not, right ? everybody packed guns in nazi germany, correct ? and by the way where does evil come from? one line answer please and no quotes from the silly book. you are walking evil archie, you are doomed. emoticonxangel dogma is you archie, you are a dogmatic gun totin religio-fascist fundamentalist. without dogma you crumble to pieces on the ground."
1080,sarc,"are you retarded or just ignorant? either way, get your facts right. limbaugh and savage do not have tv shows so if they want to listen to beck they still can on the radio. second, you imply fox fired beck...umm, no. third, the glenn beck program was the third most watched cable news program between two other fox news programs.  i'm not a fan of the glenn beck tv program but at least i'm not going around making stuff up."
1081,sarc,"of course the above doesn't apply to you, if you say that the nra is not a gun lobby then of course is gonna be true, right ? but they are not lobbysts and they are not powerful, right? of course not, and guns don't kill, and i feel in less danger of being shot in a place where everyone packs a gun rather than in a place where no one does. btw they executed the sniper who terrorised washington dc a few years back. damn! if only those he killed and wounded had only been packing guns (which don't kill) instead!! i am sure they would have been saved for guns act as a shield, right? and the sniper, what did he use to kill and terrorise, a sling shot ? emoticonxbye"
1082,sarc,are you trying to become part of a comic relief trio? you lack the power to define the situation. therefore your conclusion is false.
1083,sarc,"no, but galileo has stood up for the vpc, the brady campaign, believes we should ban handguns, semi-automatic weapons, and so-called 'assault weapons.' i think he could be called anti-gun quite accurately. peterv may not support gun bans, but he certainly does seem to think that gun laws aren't tight enough. i'd bet $50 that if a gun ban was proposed, galileo would support it. are you trying to be smart? if so, i'm not impressed. anyhow, what makes you think i 'pack 24/7?'"
1084,sarc,"so in support of a government run health care program for all american citizens, you bring us an example of a government run health care program for our veterans that according to the article is failing to provide adequate care to those veterans, and consequently causing them to die. can you just imagine how much more comfortable i am with the idea of the government getting into the private sector health care business?  bravo antonia. emoticonxgood"
1085,sarc,"so you reference shakespeare to explain the song of solomon? seems rather convoluted, but whatever."

1087,sarc,"who defines where the 'extreme left' begins? do you deny the existence of a 'conservative lens'? we all view the world through a perceptual filter. could it be that through yours, anyone left of you becomes a commie? i've heard similar said about the aclu and they've defended the 'extreme right' in court."
1088,sarc,"now all we need to see is actual evidence of the melting glaciers. that is something winny didn't see fit to actually post evidence of. all these liars do is make unfounded claims while actually proving nothing at all. i mean, show me how a land locked country like nepal is going to sink from any melting glaciers anyway. where is nepal? nepal is in between india and china - visitnepal.com this is just another feel good stunt which mooks like winny and jo will jump on like the lemmings they are. emoticonxic"

1090,sarc,it's quite obvious that you didn't read any of the responses. and who are you to call anyone blind believers when you think it's anywhere in the realm of easy to shoot a human being at 200 yards with a handgun? at 200 yards you probably can't even hit the broad side of a barn.
1091,sarc,ignorant faux patriotism and racism do nothing to undermine the fact roosevelt knew.  all we're left with is the disgusting spectre of an authoritarian navy dropout who can't bear dealing with the facts about the man responsible for 2000 dead colleagues. do you apply the same non-logic to smear anyone who states bush knew there were no wmd in iraq? or is it only your favourite presidents who get a free pass on lying the public into war.
1092,sarc,lol just can't keep a good thing down can you gans? i love how it is only you and archie who have flocked to the thread in utter dismay... i'm sure easy will be right behind carrying a crucifix to ward off the 'gay'..... and no i do not think it will be overturned and i am ecstatic that marriage equality has extended to our nations capitol. let freedom ring baby!!!!
1093,sarc,is it only the spiritually blind that can see guys like this for what they really are? rip preacher.

1096,sarc,"so you are saying that this country is based on principles of judaism? that is a date, dummy. it is not a founding principle. it was how dates were done. and 'our lord' could have been mohamed for all you know, except that it was the standard for dates. no christian principles. so at least you admit that you can't give a single location and that you can't even tell me how many times god, jesus, and religion are mentioned."

1107,sarc,exactly. and you use this example to display how feminists are bad mothers. sarah effing palin...of all people...you pick the worst mother... is she even a feminist? she seems far too stupid. edit: just because a woman is serious about her career doesnt mean shes a feminist.
1108,sarc,oh? what keeps you from having 6 or eight or for that matter having crossed bandoleers across the chest? i suspect kalifornia law will be changed a bunch and one in the pipe will be in vogue as well as a loaded mag in the gun for utility sake. you wouldn't want the perp to be disadvantaged too much now would you? how many shots must one allow the perp before you can fire back?

1114,sarc,"not necessary to 'break away'. more like to assume the powers of the state governments which are guaranteed a republican form of government and assume each of their states reserved powers. for instance, the xvii th amendment changed the way sin-ators were chosen. they were intended to be ambassadors chosen by their elected legislatures of the states and be sent to d.c. to represent their interests to the foreign country called d.c. really think so slick? read your constitution and see the powers reserved for the states and the powers denied the states. all you need is an education. no doubt the teabaggers of kalifornia will be appreciative of your blessing. good to know you have telepathy powers cause you sure don't know your history. why don't you just send the 'friend' a mental message? we are quite aware of your powers. emoticonxfrazzled"

1117,sarc,"yeah, archie, i don't know what i was thinking. how could i form an opinion on the deeds of you and easy after about 6 years of interacting with the two of you, and watching the abuse and vile you spew on everyone who doesn't agree with your hate filled rhetoric? sorry about that, i must have been thinking of two other ignorant, insulting xxxxxxxs."

1122,sarc,and volcanic eruptions have been occuring on earth for how long...billions of years? we have only been spilling oil and spitting smoke and toxins into the atmosphere for what...160 years? which one do you think has done more damage to the planet? volcanic eruptions are a natural part of the earths geological activity. dumping millions of gallons of oil into the ocean is not.  ever increasing? do you by chance have any scientific data to back the claim that earthquakes are growing in size and frequency? earthquakes have most likely been occuring for what...billions of years? strange that i'm able to sit here and exist with all these terrible earthquakes of ever increasing strength.  that i do agree with. even simone should know better than to talk about science in a forum populated by religious people. the religious people are only likely to get confused.
1123,sarc,my responce to simone post has been explained. you did not point out that my post was irrelevant you accused me of running away. you cant even remember your own post. you are deliberately avoiding admitting your mistake and you say you make me look stupid! how many more posts are you going to confirm your dishonesty? when i point out your lies you cry ad hominem! what a joke! yo udid the same thing in a previous thread and your friends accused me of picking on you. now a poster that you yourself flagged up as someone to aspire to has outrightly told you that you are wrong and should apologise and you still will not admit that your are wrong. i dont think you realise how bad you are making yourself look. looks like even your friends have abandoned youemoticonxchicken

It doesn't matter what you call them, be it criminal or gang member of dope dealer or home invader, if somebody breaks the law then they're a criminal and it's as simple as that.Seriously dude, you're trying to get off on a technicality here. Like a lawyer trying to argue ""Your honor my client isn't a prostitute, she's a female escort"". Doesn't matter what you call it or what you try to pass it off as, a criminal is a criminal regardless of what their formal title is.So which is Ripskar, do criminals have guns and are likely to shoot you in the face and kill you, or do they not have guns at all.

I guess that having another person enter a forum, and claim to be a biologist would narrow it down to just the same person emoticonXClown All you've done is said you know it is him because one writer is as rude as the other... and that this gives his identity away by some mysterious process, probably I don't understand this as I've never read set-theory! emoticonXWow What should be a very easy question becomes you repeating ""I know it is him"".Also, has he been banned as Lurch on these other fora?"
1190,sarc,I have heard of big-headed families. I have heard of square-headed families. I have even heard of Cone-headed families....but gay-headed families?There is just something not right about including the word gay and head in the same sentence. :p
1191,sarc,perhaps you would like to explain simplistic.Is the anthropic principle simplistic?What natural law created natural law?Where did the information come from?Is matter creating matter simplistic? Matter creating information?Here;s a deep thought:If matter created the Universe what if it changes it's mind! emoticonXRolleyes
1192,sarc,"I already have, hence the explanation I provided. If you challenge me to show you an error then I will. Did you expect me to try and show something that was true and see if I could convince you it wasn't? When you post your evidence it usually has holes in it, not always but the truth is funny that way. It is very difficult sometimes to cover it up.And stay away from those shrimp, eagles, gays and snowmenThey are all abominations."
1193,sarc,"Winston, I must confess my ignorance; before this, I thought your posts couldn't possibly get any more asinine. I see I was wrong about that.You have a spare tire just in case? Just in case of a car accident? In case your engine explodes? In case someone hijacks your car?Congratulations, Winston. You have made by far the most asinine post I have ever seen. And you are the most asinine person I have ever seen."
1194,sarc,"So most of your friends have had sex with your guy too? emoticonXGoodYou and I both know that homosexuals have different partners regularly, at least compared to heterosexuals."
1195,sarc,"No, quite clearly you are wrong, he is saying Countless people, facing persecution the world over - people living and those as yet unborn"". ""And"" those that are not born yet. Can you not read? He includes them with the ""AND"". Why do you think he spent his life protecting the unborn and children? You ought to read what it says. Furthermore, the human rights act, specifically talks about protecting the unborn too. You lose"
1196,sarc,So now gays don't exist? The anti-marriage side has reached a new low! Denying the existance of a what they are aruging aganist! I didn't think you guys could go that low. I was sadly mistaken. 
1197,sarc,"So, no actual source. And Hannity and Colmes? Yeesh, you might as well quote Limbaugh or Coulter or O'Reilly. They're all equally ""fair and balanced"".And the kindergarten ""sex-ed"" was age appropriate. Congrats, you've bought a lie. "
1198,sarc,"I see. So physical punishment for sin is now unnecssary? Intriguing. Do tell. Seriously, I am curious where you go with this.And finally:"
1199,sarc,So they haven't gone into bankruptsy yet? I guess the illegal loans are helping after all. emoticonXRolleyes
1200,sarc,CNN and CBS Left wing? you wouldn't know left wing if it came up and socked you one with rolled up Socialist Worker!
1201,sarc,"That was someone else you were posting to about them ""hammering"" porn, whatever that means.Gay men watch hetero porn and thats the reason for so much gayness? Real logical."
1202,sarc,"You really do hate the truth, don't you lyte! And you're a teacher? What a scary thought that is based on your twisted world view. emoticonXDonno I have my own video for you to watch, one which doesn't tell you lies by pointing to a couple examples of why 10,000 emails don't expose the fraud which has been perpetrated on humanity for a generation now.YouTube - John Coleman - Global Warming ScamHere's another video where he sues Al Gore: YouTube - Al Gore sued by over 30.000 Scientists for Global Warming fraud / John Coleman"
1203,sarc,"I think you're VERY mistaken.I'm not a republican. Nor a democrat.Never been registered as anything other than 'independent'.I'm such because I think.Unlike a party parrot that you seem to be yourself.Since I'm neither...who the hell can ""I"" be in the minority?Must be your biggoted knee-jerk reaction to think that anyone who doesn't think like you and slurp the Flavor Aid is the opposition and as such must be in the 'enemy party'.And you are a hater because you verbiage is hate filled, caustic and ever insulting. And not in a funny, jestful way but full of vitriol and bile."
1204,sarc,"emoticonXFrazzled emoticonXWow emoticonXWow Did I read that right?I better get a hard hat and a snowmobile, I think the sky might be about to fall, but the riding's going to be good in hell. :p Waxy"
1205,sarc,"Ah yes, your diversionary tactics. I am sure if I provided it, you would move the goal posts, or demand evidence that you know is not yet available.. So, since this thread is about Jesus, and if a 'historical' Jesus actually existed, where is your evidence besides religious articles, forgeries, and accounts taken from Christians?What?? No where to be found?? Gasp."
1206,sarc,"B.S. simone. He was the perfect age for Vietnam. Why hasn't he released his draft card? I know, they only sent them to citizens."
1207,sarc,"Three days? Non Christians supposedly spend an eternity in hell, not the weekend."
1208,sarc,And this differs from your cell how? (oh wait it doesn't).
1209,sarc,Dragons and Dinosaurs coexisting only recently? hmm when they did dissapear? Maybe Conan the Barbarian killed them all!
1210,sarc,"How's that coming along, by the way? Because IIRC Jesus said he'd be returning before the generation that saw him died out. And then every century afterwards, his return has been ""just around the corner"".emoticonXRolleyes"
1211,sarc,The penis is not designed for the hand?so you want this entire board to believe you don't wank off! Oh come on.....get real...everybody does it...who are you kidding....You lost all crediblity right there!
1212,sarc,"You mean to tell me that you would deny a woman's right to her own body for a zygote, yet you have no problem murdering real human beings? Sounds like a conservative to me..."
1213,sarc,"So you for strict regulation of business but not people? Interesting...do you know who runs businesses? Yeah, people."
1214,sarc,"OMG, are you for real? I'd think that if you saw a plane flying low, being chased by a fighter jet, you'd get out of the way. Any SANE person would...Further, you'd be peeved if you found out that it was your govt. being completely insensitive (not to mention wasteful). The govt. screwed up...if it had been Bush you'd be crying bloody murder."
1215,sarc,A government that respects people's liberties is far worse than one that imposes the majority's version of morality on a resistant and dissident minority?Humbug! You only say that because you believe you are in a majority on equal rights for gay Americans.
1216,sarc,"I'm going to ask you a direct question, which I am sure you will ignore.John is an atheist.He has stolen some money. He is sincerely remorseful over his actions.Since John is remorseful, has your Judeo-Christian God FORGIVEN John?You can ""blah, blah, blah"" all you want, but a ""yes"" or a ""no"" needs to be given EXPLICITLY in your answer."
1217,sarc,"Well, the antichrist is going to come and make any true believer a heretic any way so what am I worried about? I knew the risks before I accept the job. :-)"
1218,sarc,"Whose culture are we talking about, here?I thought I was a member of the culture. What am I, chopped liver?"
1219,sarc,Why? Would you rather get stabbed to death for twenty minutes than get hit in the head with a bullet? A desire to have suffering extended - hmmmm...
1220,sarc,"Oh, now you've got Obama leaving a mess in your hole, and James Carville blasting your hole (Spicy Cajunspunk)?Now Bubba's not so sure about wanting to plug/plough your hole. Boy you really do get around, EZ. That hole must be pretty wide and loose."
1221,sarc,"Ok, so if we are going to let everything take the ""normal course of nature"", then lets just let everyone die. Have cancer? Too bad, its the natural course of nature that you die. What about heart failure? Sorry, no paddles of life for you. We're going to let nature take its course. Just like your beloved pope, nature is not always right."
1222,sarc,That's an out that's peculiar to Christians. Good? Godidit. Bad? Devil's work.
1223,sarc,"If they haven't been discovered yet, HOW THE BLOODY HELL DO YOU KNOW?Ten percent more brains and you'd be pondlife. emoticonXKill"
1224,sarc,"When you are menstruating, do you make sure you don't touch anyone so that you don't make them ""unclean""? If not, you better start."
1225,sarc,I still haven't seen an adequate rebuttal to this. Why can't people marry themselves if they are in love with themselves?  I must have missed your response.
1226,sarc,Force the children to learn science? How obscene!!what's next ? maths?? emoticonXRolleyes
1227,sarc,"No evidence for all the major links in the ""story"" eh?Okay then, you define some ""major links"" and then we will look at the evidence."
1228,sarc,"Are you blind? I was refering to Nancy Pelosi's ""'fair' speech"" policies, not free speech. Fair speech is an attempt to limit free speech."
1229,sarc,Obviously sarcasm escapes you....if you did not understand that remark about gun control working in Europe during the 1930's.Report me? My knees are trembling already.I believe Steeve was expressing his right to free speech.
1230,sarc,"hunter, would you be interested in actually discussing this logically? or do you simply wish to toss out empty assertions and run away when challenged? if your view is the truth, then you have no reason to run."
1231,sarc,"Thanks for what? Pointing out that you have once again misread an article? No problem, I'll be sure to keep up the effort seeing as how you apprecitate so much. emoticonXGood"
1232,sarc,"A sex offender is always wicked and villainous? Geesh, not very forgiving. While I certainly agree many are, I have seen many who are not a threat to society.Those folks on ""To Catch A Predator"" are definitely a threat though."
1233,sarc,Is this satire? If so...bravo...well done. emoticonXGood If you are really serious...ummmm...excuse me. emoticonXEmbarrassed
1234,sarc,"True until proven otherwise eh? Xcaliber and you must get along great.You have things backward and you are probably being confused by the 'experiment to falsify a theory', that is a tenet of science based on the generalization that untrue theories are easily disproved.No logician (and by extension no good scientist) would ever hold a lack of disproof as proof.Oh right theories are never proven, so in fact your definition of theory would go something like this -> 'an idea that is not disproved which we assume is true'."
1235,sarc,You want a world without limits? Head over to some countries in Africa and see how anarchy is doing for them.
1236,sarc,"Liberals are squawking about more funding for atheist groups? Homosexuals don't deserve equality? Liberals are pro-terrorism?Goodness, even your backtracking just digs the hole deeper. Just can't help it, can you?"
1237,sarc,Will the Catholics ever elect somebody who is not a complete knob? He speaks just like he knows something about gay relationships. emoticonXRolleyes
1238,sarc,"So, do you spend all of your days as an Obama shill? You have two posts, both anti-McCain. I hope Obama pays well. emoticonXRolleyes"
1239,sarc,"What facts? The article above your post is replete with documented facts. Are you in denial? Have you even read the article? Are all of your responses knee-jerk, shoot-from-the-hip defense mechanisms?Pay attention."
1240,sarc,"And it could have been liberal ALIENS as well!Oooh. Can we make them gay illegal immigrants? I like that slant!Maybe they were talking about how he was ""terrorizing"" people with his fashion sense? Or maybe the ""terrorist"" comment wasn't even with regards to anything Palin said either. Maybe one of the guys thought he saw Osama bin Laden in the audience!YOU DON'T KNOW!emoticonXDonno"
1241,sarc,"I guess we can take ""In God We Trust"" off our money and the courts will be a nightmare, what will they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth on, a Readers Digest? I am sure the Pledge of Allegiance is going to have to be changed also.If we convert to another religion do we get more time? Do the bunnies and puppies and zombie ant making mold take over the world or do we implode or what happens to the planet?"
1242,sarc,"Obviously, in the event of a disaster, George W. Bush sure thinks he has a right to choose.Hmmm, let's see, should I interrupt my vacation just because people are drowning in New Orleans? Naw, I don't think I should. They're just poor people and they probably didn't vote for me."
1243,sarc,"Apparently not. The poster Justine responded to has won the ""most posts per day"" award for some months now... and this after only posting since last November. Can you say ""obsessed""? I knew that you could. :)"
1244,sarc,You're somehow right despite the fact that all reliable evidence is on our side? What idiocy.
1245,sarc,"It is you XXXXX, that can not comprehend. It is not that abortion has no effects, but that the effects are already included in the calculations. Apparently you think of yourself as a scientist. Thats a sad joke. And you sign as J.P. Sartre, a XXXXX like you? Only in America.:p"
1246,sarc,Is it possible to be an adult and be as clueless as you seem to be?This was in response to the question did Jesus not believe in evolution.Only someone with similar mental capacity to yours would ask such a question.It seems unfair I have to answer this senseless comment you added to the nonsense.
1247,sarc,"You have no Idea how glad I was that I was sitting down when I read this!!First it shocks me that you haven't labeled all those who claim to see UFO's liberals.Then I have to wonder didn't at one time the RCC say we were the center of the universe,... The sun went around the earth,... the earth was flat ?? Theres no one but us .. It was all created for us??Ok I'm goning to go take a little breath of fresh air and rest for a moment as this is very disturbing to me! .... V.O.R. and I agree on something. I think I'm going to be sick!! Back in a few."
1248,sarc,"I am just passing on what I seen personally. I am not trying to prove anything. Just sharing an observation. PS...from ""our"" point of view? You got a mouse in your pocket? Please explain."
1249,sarc,"You call me or a family I may have, a perversion(sorry the word was ""perversity""), but that is not hate? I believe I am probably younger than you, but that doesn't mean I was born yesterday."
1250,sarc,"Selective reading huh? Well, there is none so blind as he who will not see."
1251,sarc,Duh? I'm referring to the left wingers right here on this forum as well as the left wing media and left wing congress and left wing Teleprompter of the United States (TOTUS).

1253,sarc,"So, Clinton getting it on with Lewinsky is a sign of intelligence? You can work for the Obama administration with those kinds of smarts. LOl!!"
1254,sarc,Simone you are a wretched little girl and unitl you can properly organize your thoughts into a comprehensible group of statements that expresses your views conciesly you must not post anywhere a man may run afoul of your devilish whimsical rantings. Your befuddlement of these issues of great import will not be tolerated. Do we make ourselves clear young lady? Now off to your room to contemplate the nonsensical mischief and unneccessary consternation we have all suffered due to your blatant disregard of forums ettiquite. emoticonXFrazzledYou sound like a 9 year old trying to get a date. Simone hasd left the building the debate has drifted it isn't the end of the world. The sun will rise tomorrow emoticonXBouncer
1255,sarc,"Well, good, I'm glad as heck you have a mom you can tell that to. Mine would've hit the roof, and then hit me on the way back down. Did she flip or was she pretty cool about it?Just remember (who would we be if not preachy? Us ol' adults, we don't know nuthin') that b.c. isn't one hundred percent reliable or that condoms can break and you can still get nasty bugs all kinds of different ways."
1256,sarc,"Here's a fact that you don't have to like: New York legalized same sex marriage. Awww...is his wittle feewings huwt? Good. It's about time you wake up to the reality that you are in an ever shrinking majority, and like it or not...democracy has been served. GO NY!!!"
1257,sarc,"Do you even read what anyone posts? Try it, you might learn something.......maybe not......."
1258,sarc,"Well, Jews have always been indecisive. Like this joke says:Q: How many Jews does it take to screw in a light bulb?A: 4; 1 to screw it in and 3 to argue about which way it turns."
1259,sarc,Are you going to go and urinate on his grave as well?My! My! What hatred and vitriol! What does it feel like to have so black a heart?
1260,sarc,"I guess they could if they knew where all the parts were located. Oh, I would think they would be in hell. I can't imagine ""God"" would have anything to do with mass murderers; do you? BTW, this is Osama's technical guide for the terrorists. http://www.almostaproverb.com/images4/osama_dummies.jpg"
1261,sarc,"Hey, have you printed your name on the inside waistband of you dungarees yet so when you pull your head out from where the sun don't shine you'll know who the heck you are? How many times do you need to be told....GAYS HAVE CHILDREN...MY SON IS PROOF ENOUGH."
1262,sarc,do you go to study hall? probably not. It is a requirement where the athletes sign in and sit in the library with their teams and are monitored to make sure that their studying is getting done.
1263,sarc,"I'm not interested in who isn't hitting on you. Do you want an ugly, flaming, gay cellulite blubber-wench hitting on you for three years or not??? Or maybe a pod of those whales all hitting on you??For the record, gays make normal men's skin crawl, and not in a good way. So keep the spiritually-challenged heathens out of the men's barracks, and out of their showers. Just because you and the rest of the pro-gay crowd thinks that kind of depraved activity is ok doesn't mean the rest of society does."
1264,sarc,"That is an interesting fact, how come I have never heard such a thing..maybe a link is in order and not a stormfront or the like link please....actually I have listened to gangsta rap...Easy E, Snoop, NWA, and so many others, in fact they are in my truck right now.. imagine a redhead ""whitey"" takes enjoyment in listening to all kinds of music.. hmm I also have Lady Smith Black Mambazo, Nat King Cole, and while we are at it I have music that I adore from Iran, Iraq, Saudi, Turkey and so many I cant list them all... whats your point?I would hardly call rap the decay of the 90's, apparently a lot of people listen if they are making money....I wonder if you have a crazy relative somewhere in your past? Maybe that would explain a lot."
1265,sarc,"So if a jew tells a big nose joke, he's saying that all jews have big noses? This is a joke thread; I posted a joke, get over it."
1266,sarc,"Is your thinking really this simplistic? Either I have to agree with you or I am an anarchist? Is that all the complexity you can handle? This or that? Black or white? The best soda in the world is Sprite and everything else is wrong? What a boring little pigeon-holed world you live in.No harm no foul - that is where I stand on sex and romance. Kids, animals and those who don't or can't consent are off-limits. K? Now that I have established (AGAIN) how I feel on that matter, let me reinstate.Any God that allows love and intimacy for only a select group is viscious."
1267,sarc,"http://blog.pos.org/wp-content/uploa...dule-press.pdfJust a tad inconsistent, wouldn't you say?But, given that there has been a heavily-financed anti-Obama campaign on national media, it may be understandable.And, ABCNEWS is another clone of FauxNews, dontcha know?"
1268,sarc,"Three pages of ""facts"" without a source? ROTFLMAO*Notice your own source says ""only 6,000 documents were released. Is that a lie? emoticonXGoodBooooosh did it, it is all his fault:Articles: Project Gunrunner Wasn't Fast and Furious by Any Means"
1269,sarc,So your claim that no pre-existing belief is necessary is untested by you. Do you have an example of an actual non-believer having a religious experience that made a believer of them? In my experience God never appears to atheists. Funny that.
1270,sarc,Don't you ever get tired of acting like a little kid?Heaven forbid anyone who actually know what you think but you can bet it is another juvenile...
1271,sarc,"Ah, so when I lobby for burets for my chemistry classes, I'm indoctrinating my kids into the evils of iodometry? *gasp*Yes, it's a stupid as it sounds, because it's analogous to your argument."
1272,sarc,Hey slim Jim what exactly was that about spelling errors and typos any way?Pray enlighten us with your wisdom on why it matters little.By your own reasoning and logic why would it matter if they did or not? Why would one imagine they wish to get away alive? 
1273,sarc,So the huge amount of men and material that the US contributed to the war was just not necessary. Thats your argument?Well that makes perfect sense.What's a BBS?
1274,sarc,"lol. Thanks for agreeing with me. I stated as you quoted that it did not work. Where again where you trying to attack me? By calling me illiterate you yourself call yourself illiterate as your statements agree with what I said. If you need me, I'll be in the audience. You're arguing with yourself. Pray tell, where did I say he accomplished anything? Or are you lying? [/quote]Sure child. They have real religious freedom there[/quote]Only you would consider Taosim and Buddhism not to be religions. Oh wait, I fogot, you consider all non-extremist christians not be athiests. "
1275,sarc,"All I can say is that they have to catch me first. Besides, what would Macy's do with my kneecaps anyway? They would really have to beautify my kneecaps after they get them off of me. They would probibly turn them into porsilin and give them away this Christmas. And by give them away, I mean sale them for thirty-five dollars. Hey, if it's the Macy's in New York, thirty-five dollars would be just giving it away. Actually, I'd like to avoid a sacrificial offering because that would just be to bloody, even if I am putting this post on here on Halloween.And as far as Amanda, well, to quote Sammy Hagar, ""I'll Fall In Love Again."" See, I need my alphabetical music. I am a rock and roll nerd."
1276,sarc,"You are going to need to be very specific here buckwheat:Exactly how did you deduce that I think I am so much better than you?And please, be brief."
1277,sarc,WOO HOO.So the main stream entertainment industry who brought us such great talent as Brittney Spears does not consider this film the cats meow? WEE HA - all the more reason to see it.
1278,sarc,Your not going to trod out the myth of the smallpox-infected blankets are you? That one's been disproven so many times that even YOU should know that. emoticonXRolleyes

1280,sarc,"And this coming from a so called, self proclaimed ""rational christian"" ? It appears you have blown your cover as a poser by showing your true colors as an anti-christian atheist and a hatemonger. Thanks for revealing your true Nature. emoticonXGood"
1281,sarc,"Did you even read ythe OP? Did you even read the title? Pointless distinction? Huh. I understand what you are saying. I also know you are changing your argument. When it was proven that Sanford did indeed run on family values, you changed your argument. Instead of just owning up and admitting that, you weasel out of it. "
1282,sarc,So your political thinking is 40 years out of date? That does explain quite a bit.
1283,sarc,"Ah, so I don't like democracy, and yet it is you who in the post are telling me that I have to support McCain's statement. Are you serious? That sure doesn't sound like democracy to me. I also find it funny that you claim that I don't like democracy when my very post stated that I would be voting for the Democrat party. But then, I guess if we don't support Bushyboy and his fellow republicanazis, we must be against democracy, right? Get real, Phyllis."
1284,sarc,"You know, if the God deniers even let the baby out of the mother's womb alive to begin with then he's already one step ahead of the game.As for what to do with him then, show me under the New Covenant where Jesus said to stone kids?Personally, I think we should stone obese, jaded statues of weird looking holy men."
1285,sarc,Sure keep thinking that way and never mind the millions he put in his pocket. How was someone else put it? A thimble size brain case almost empty.
1286,sarc,"An objective test? Wow! Tell me, how do you prove this test is a true useful test? Please don't tell me reason or yet another objective test."
1287,sarc,"Stalin died of natural causes while in power, I believe. Perhaps the fall of communism is due in part that the purges stopped. So, killing hundreds of thousands of people was wise for Stalin, huh? Good. Good. Anybody disagree with canadianman76?"
1288,sarc,"Is this another attempt of yours to paint all that believe in smaller, less-intrusive government as loonies? Very transparent, sorry. :("
1289,sarc,"So who do you hold responsible for forcing people to stay at the convention center to die? Lemme guess.Should they be held criminally negligent? I'm sure the ""bipartisan"" commission will find out who is responsible and hold them accountable."
1290,sarc,"Nice try, but no cigar. I never said that inflation had no effect. Of course it does. But even factoring in the alleged 500% inflation since the 1960s or whatever it happens to be depending on calculation does not account for the huge run-up in the price of crude to nearly $80 not that long ago. My beef has been the resident ""experts"" here who flout their supposed knowledge and money to impress us lesser mortals who reminded them of the iron law of supply and demand. That, by the way, is found in Economics 101. But you knew that, didn't you?So now, it's a ""technical"" correction. What's next? Some wisdom from Joe Granville or the Elliot Wave Theory?Ball in your court."
1291,sarc,Contradict what? Thank you for acknowledging that I know what I'm talking about. I call it questioning. You call it wrangling because you've no coherent thoughts of your own.
1292,sarc,"Now I read this and thought there are two ways I could describe you:1) You are very poorly read in history.or2) Why don't you give a damn about the born? at what point does that defenseless little child become second in your concerns to the unborn?I'm intrigued, I really am."
1293,sarc,"So you're openly admitting to being ignorant of a standard debating technique? Well, okay!Here, let me teach you something."
1294,sarc,"have you considered a career in advertising?by the way you f***ed us too. Australians troops were cannon fodder in WWI for the British Empire, remember Gallipoli?"
1295,sarc,"You mean the malcontents bred? Oh Noes! Who are the ""we"" who get to do it back, and whose army will you borrow to do it with? the present bunch of obese felons are already struggling to cope with their present duties."
1296,sarc,"Are you being dense on purpose? I said that I'm not all into the semantics of baby/fetus. I'll conceid that its killing a baby. The TERM for it is fetus, fetus' become babies. I see the logic there (in fact I think I'm agreeing with you). Why must you keep pounding this drum?"
1297,sarc,"Wasn't that your boy, Clinton, that screwed the intern? Or was it Mayor Sam Adams of Portland who screwed a 17 year old intern? No wait, it couldn't have been Adams, that intern was a boy. emoticonXRolleyes"
1298,sarc,Are you serious? Man I thought you actually had a brain in that dense hollow cranium of yours. You do realize there are Straight Atheists and GAY Christians right Gans?
1299,sarc,"So that's what, at least 4 lies in 8 days? Pretty impressive Archie. You should be on your knees asking god's forgiveness for your lies."
1300,sarc,"Are you telling me liberals have jobs? You sure can't tell it by all the anti military/war protests, the flag burnings, you saw prior to the start of the war and by all the libs that post here 24/7........They are either unemployed or 12 year old kids out of school for summer vacation.........."
1301,sarc,"What? You're not familiar with a favorite political tactic, guilt by association. emoticonXWow"
1302,sarc,"Oh you do love to do the psychological technique known as 'transference' don't you...or is it 'projection'??? You are so obsessed with gay sex, I would not be surprised if you and Ted Haggard have a lot to talk about."

1313,sarc,"Was that so hard? Anti gay Christians do want gays to oppose their, marriages, discriminate against them, oppose christians from being able to adopt, and practice thier religion. Since anti gay christians are doing all these things to gay people then that is how they want gay people to treat christians."
1314,sarc,"Hmmm, well then, God must be unrighteous since we ""evil atheists"" - and tons of other evil people - have not been eliminated.

If not God, then she's on the wrong page (note Acts 5).Ask her if the Bible doesn't say gay sex is a sin (Leviticus 18:22, Lev. 20:13, Romans 1:26-27; I Corinthians 6:9-10; Jude 7, etc.)?

1408,notsarc,"Why do conservatives support conservatives? Paul's theology found favor with the Christians that won amongst the early churches. Paul was not considered an Apostle by the original 11 and Barnabas. Luke doesn't have him meet a risen Jesus only Paul says he did. His first missionary trek was a failure and the next two he was not equal with Barnabas.But the Apostles did not teach the same as Paul, similiar but not the same."

Most gay people already leave those states anyway."
1410,notsarc,"I posted two versions:1. I am a rational being. Is it logical to assume that a rational entity formed me? (not my parents--on a mankind scale) Is it more logical than to assume that I generated out of inanimate matter incapable of logic? Generated due to ""miraculous"" odds? I'm not sure what the numbers are. I think the logical sequence is a belief in a higher power rather than a springboard to logic from a primordial soup of nothing.2. I came up with a belief in the supernatural via natural logic--I am a rational being. I could not have therefore come from irrational combinations of inanimate matter that somehow combined to form rational animate matter. I came from a rational source."
1411,notsarc,The point is that there are plenty of issues that go on in church meetings and denominational conventions that are areas of enormous disagreeement and struggle. It happens--it's not just this issue. You just don't hear about them because the press isn't interested in those issues.

Well, since the government passed the gun control laws that gun hater pilot wanted the government should be held responsible. That means the tax payer will pay for gun haters pilot gun free bs!Gun hater pilot wants to disarm the law abiding citizens so criminals like the ones at columbine can freely walk around and kill their victims!Gun hater pilot wants to disarm the law abiding citizens so criminals like the ones on 9/11 that used box cutters to take over airplanes crowed with people!"
1414,notsarc,"You can disagree all you want but an psychologist will tell you that you do this. Do you not get an image in your head when you hear someone talk about what they may look like? For example if you heard an Asian accent on the phone you would probably think that person is Asian. This is a stereotype...the person could easily be white, black, etc but you process that normally when you hear that it is an Asian person."
1415,notsarc,"Try to stay on track here jyoshu, the title of this thread is the real gay agenda. So why would I talk about the many things humans do that aren't related to procreation ? And I'm not saying the abandonment of intercourse is an issue at all. I'm saying that IF the whole World adopted the homosexual lifestyle, the human race would cease to exist in ONE generation. That is only to show that the practice and lifestyle is unnatural and destructive to the survival of the species if accepted and practiced as normal. So dont extend my premise beyond what I meant to imply with it."
1416,notsarc,"LOL, so rather than face the question you're going to attack me personally and insinuate that I'm a bigot? That's pathetic gman.True or False - Jesus Christ is the son of God, the God who is the one true creator and master of all. You are the one presenting an outright lie. Of course Jesus presents himself as the true and only way to salvation through God. Just because there isn't a verse that states that all of his followers should arm wrestle the buddhists to see who's right is meaningless.Irregardless, you've chosen to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ. Why? The quesiton is really that simple. There's no generalizations or stereotyping, no ""lie"", no deception, just a question. Your avoidance of it is as telling as answering it.Waxy"
1417,notsarc,"Why is saying that many things conflict with the well being of Society at large and bans them to the disappointment of those who endorse such activities. Consider rape, murder, incest and sodomy as good historical examples of such taboo activities, taken by you as an inditement of all gay people JSD ? You seem to take any moral stance or argument I make very personally, as if I'm accusing you of being those things. You work very hard to read into, demonize and condemn everything I say as if it is intended as a personal attack. You really need to work on that."
1418,notsarc,"You don't seem to understand. It is a simple thing the law would say oil is this much, you must continue to sell gas and this is how much you will charge for it. Why is this a hard concept for you to understand? Electricity is regulated why not oil and gasoline? I don't see a difference."
1419,notsarc,"Says who? People have the right to say anything they want to. There is NO right to not be judged by someone. It doesn't matter if something someone else does affects you and me or not. People can think whatever they want about other people. People can also SAY what they want. As far as a personal philosophy of behavior, I agree with you--what you're saying is a good rule to live by. But I can't agree people have no right to condemn or judge others."

1423,notsarc,"Egg stage? What are you talking about? Abortion happens in the fetal stage. Partial Birth abortion is a KIND of abortion that is done in a later term, although you can get a regular abortion at that stage as well. What makes you assume they would have miserable lives? What makes you assume that if they did, they would rather have not exited? Ive gone through a lot of XXXX in my life, but Im happy that Im alive. There is absolutely no difference between the humanity of the fetus and the humanity of an infant, except for age. "
1424,notsarc,"What are you speaking of? The bible itself, or the books which the bible is based on? The bible itself is only 1600 to 1700 years old. There were many revisions to the bible as I had meantion elsewhere. Many different books have been added and removed over the early years of the bbile as well. If any of it is consistent it is only because it has been put together that way and anything which disagreed was removed. It was far easier to control content back then than it would be now since there were really very few actual books around as it was."

And yes, as the law is currently written, it does matter how large the church is. I would suggest that those that don't like it lobby to get it changed."
1427,notsarc,"Actually, what gay marriage proponents simply want is to be treated like every one else. Denying the right to marriage because of his/her sexual orientation makes them second class citizens. The supporters of the anti-gay movement simply want to impose their moral values on to the rest of the public, the recent prop 8 ballot initiative proves it. Ever read John Locke or JS Mill? You should, it's what our country ideals are based on. You have your bubble and I have mine so just leave me alone; and the majority are never always right and should not have a say in what is moral or just based on their beliefs."
1428,notsarc,"Satan has an independent voice and mind, Jazy, so you'll have to come up with something better than that. But she did answer the question, writing, ""I decided to leave the church after my car was keyed with slurs and threats after mentioning I was bi.""So, somebody sinned in keying her car and using slurs. So that makes it ok for her to sin and leave Christ? That's absolutely the most lame excuse I've heard yet. On the other hand, it might just appear she's choosing bi-sexuality over Christ, which isn't a good plan either. And you're sticking up for that folly. Like I've said elsewhere, you continually choose the gay thing over the Christ thing. That's your idol. That's what you do. You'll back-slap anyone who chooses illicit sin over Christ.  Shame on you!"
1429,notsarc,"Umm.. again they are identified as Messianic Jewish. Google 'Messianic Jewish' if you care, thousands of hits. So you now try to personally misidentify this 'Jewish' group on your own terms? A Messianic Jew is a Jewish person who believes that Yeshua (Jesus) is their Messiah. Some people (You) think that a Jewish person who believes in Jesus is no longer a Jew. But what could possibly be more Jewish than believing in the Jewish Messiah, Yeshua? But anyway, that is NOT the point, the point is the same as I made before: The fact that there are Messianic Jews shows exactly what I was outlining in the top post. You seem to be inferring that I am suggesting that such 'change' means a change for ALL Jews, sic, obviously I am not suggesting that."

The bigger man usually need not find it necessary to prove he is, but is secure in his knowledge he is or is big enough to realize when he isn't and adjust accordingly.My guess is this is not the only place this happens. These things happen, you fall, you get up, people laugh, you move on, you see someone fall you can laugh or help them up. Just depends on who you want to be.Sorry I am a sucker for empty milk crates. Can't seem to walk by one without jumping on and taking her for a spin."
1431,notsarc,"because i haven't seen evidence to convince me otherwise. what have you said that i've 'distorted?' you keep accusing me of putting words in my mouth, but you're reluctant to specify. why should i assume that such people do exist? the burden of proof is yours."
1432,notsarc,"you are aware that according to the koran such actions have the death penalty? you may disagree with the principle of that or carrying out the directives of some sacred text. frankly i couldn't give a rats arse about your faith or theirs. if the accusation is accurate someone acted recklessly which cost 8 lives and that is what matters, not someone's ideas about the basis of the universe."
1433,notsarc,"did a christian in this forum say that? you can have the same kind of morals christians do, but you just don't have an objective basis for justifying them like we do. that's your problem. i have a flash for you. you would be doing gay and straight sinners a favor by advising them to repent and receive jesus christ as their lord and savior for the remission of their sins, before they perish and drop down into the pit. and that holds true for you too."

1437,notsarc,"huh? then what's the difference in supporting legal same-sex marriage? it's a rapidly shifting landscape. look at the current opinion polls, which favour equal marriage. the last round of ballot initiatives was some time ago, given how things are trending toward acceptance, and they didn't pass by that much. the anti-crowd is no longer mainstream society."
1438,notsarc,"so what? jefferson is a prime example in opposites and double standards. he believed in freedom but owned slaves. wrote the declaration of independence yet only believed in freedom for white men not women or people of color. this stance is very consistent with his double standard. he was also an adulterous, womanizer who had sex with his slave women and producing children who would remain slaves. so there again is his double standard he enslaved his own children."
1439,notsarc,"along with some others here, you have missed the point. i know we all have the ability to file extensions for various reasons. i don't really care how much money they have. more power to them for being filthy rich. a candidate for president is supposed to reveal his (and spouse's) tax returns. teresa has apparently asked for an extension just to have it revealed after the convention. why?  is there anything to hide that would hurt kerry's chances of even being nominated? this has nothing to do with the average citizen."

1442,notsarc,"how are they different? both can lead to depression, impaired judgement and decrease in ability. what is the difference? you can't just claim they are completely different and leave it at that. how are they different? you say i fail to provide how sleep [loss] can be just as violent as drugs. you or epaphras_faith have yet to prove that drugs can cause violence. i have just proved that sleep loss causes a decrease in ability and impairs judgement and leads to depression. you haven't proven anything more that drugs does."

1444,notsarc,"you all seem to miss the point, it is not about hiv/aids. if is was the poster would have posted more about education, or about prevention. he didn't. his motivation was to say all gays are diseases. if you say that all women make up 70% of new cases, does it mean that all women are hiv postive. of course not. but that is the light he shed on it. if he were to have said 70% of all crime is committed by non-whites. would it have been ay different? it is not about what he posted, it is about why!"

1447,notsarc,"isn't predestination incompatible with the idea of free will ? calvinist doctrine, in its pristine form, had a theory of predestination in which only the 'elect' were, from an original principle, 'guaranteed' salvation and everybody else doomed to a spiritual void. i'm not sure that even joining the calvinist cult (voluntarily) would allow you to be counted among the elect. after exposure to the gospels, people either choose to follow christ or not for a huge number of reasons, emotional factors, etc., etc. as a rational agent, wouldn't the choice ultimately be an exercise of free will ?"
1448,notsarc,"is that why when everyone turned their back to bush to cheer the couple, bush just sat there with his hands folded looking impatient? what was really sickening to me was when everyone put ink on their fingers. they totally cheapened the bravery of the iraqis. none of these pissants waited in line where they might be shot. they didn't walk home hoping no one would see the ink and kill them. and they certainly aren't in the middle of the war. it was truly sick for them to have that ink on their fingers."

1451,notsarc,"good one, johnhanks. (glad you included the 'pleased with the outcome' part). :p  what about the emotional aspect? the moral aspect? again - we are leaving religion out of it. au fait?  not talking about religion on this part either, now john. as i stated earlier: what is a piece of paper to two people in love?"

1456,notsarc,"but how is it concerned with this? or perhaps more to the point; what exactly do you mean by political correctness? to me, it`s an atmosphere of intolerance towards intolerance. and has nothing to do with legislation what-so-ever. perhaps we are simply 'talking' about different things here? how do they censor free speach? and in what ways does the priciple of free speach apply to academic institutions?"

1463,notsarc,"deception is not an admirable trait for a democratic government as it does represent the people, the citizenry. do you wonder why hate is directed at our country and not our leadership? we're considered deceptive as a nation because our leadership made a bad call with iraq and even though the american public bought the series of refocusing, most of the world caught us in a lie. how can we be trusted to not invade and occupy any country that disagrees with our ideology? and you wonder why smaller countries are scrambling for nuclear weapons?"
1464,notsarc,take it up with who brought it up. who said the idea of it being 'scientific' is the criteria for a theory to be taught in schools?  schools have to have some degree of autonomy to have the curriculum they want without over-regulation. who sets the standard of what's 'scientific' or not?
1465,notsarc,your right about the 14 year old and the ten year old but if it is a 18 and 14 should that be legal? or 18 and 15? 16 and 21 is legal (although it is wrong) because the youngest one is still legal. age of consent = 16 years old. if your basing it on a year gap what about 10 years? i am 10 years older than my fiance. before anyone jumps to conclusions i am 38. and she is 28. legal? why? we are both over 16.......period.

1468,notsarc,"you have to be kidding me. you don't really believe this, do you??? sure they may have white people on from time to time, but obviously they exclude white people since you can turn it on and almost always see only black people. so the criteria of whether something is racist or not is whether or not there is a 'single culture' behind it? i don't see why having a culture behind it is really relevant. things can be racist or not independent of whether there is a culture there."
1469,notsarc,"i thought he considered everyone who didn't adhere to his views as the same? jews, muslims, catholics etc. were all just as bad in his eyes iirc. -wez"
1470,notsarc,"up to a point, but ther are things some people would consider 'wrong' that others would not. for example, most muslims would consider drinking alcohol to be wrong, while most non-muslims would not. some people believe it is wrong to hit someone, whether or not they have hit you, others believe you have a right to retaliate. some believe that sex is a big deal and should be reserved only for marriage, others believe any activity between consenting adults is morally ok. all of these are moral issues. which view should schools teach? should they teach that killing people is wrong? how about stealing? should they put things in context, so that stealing is only wrong in a society that recognises personal property. should they conflate morality with law? that opens yet another can of worms."
1471,notsarc,"[quote=sigma]any number, even the 1000 figure touted, is most likely incorrect. there just isn't enough data to make a solid claim.

1472,notsarc,how are they not comparable? i have shown how dependency plays a role in both of them. if the rule is dependency (as we have been discussing) then with conjoined twins the dependent one should be allowed to be killed.

1474,notsarc,"that is strange the last i read bin laden absolutely hates the regime in iran, mainly becasue iran is run by the shia and bin laden is a sunni.  so iran should be held accountable for actions of bin laden ? it seems like before(iraq) people are trying to conjure up links between the real terrorist threat(aq) and unrelated nation."
1475,notsarc,"daniel dennett asks, how did just one species, homo sapiens, acquire the numinous perspective that can have such a profound influence on people's lives? he seems to think that religions evolved and originally served a 'primitive' philosophical intention - such as explaining the hidden 'causes' of natural events in pre-scientific societies. to give just one example: the rise and fall of the tides were observed, but not understood. so the phenomena were attributed to the power of a god (or gods) etc. i think this is a pretty commonplace answer, but not necessarily wrong.  why has religion survived the scepticism of the intellectual enlightenment and the rational attacks of science? the idea that some fundamental 'psychic need' in humanity is satisfied by having religious beliefs seems (to me) the most promising speculation."
1476,notsarc,"now you are just playing games. you claimed the institution isn't being harmed. i said it really is--what else would you call it if the instution as we know would be done away with? the evidence is that if the institution as we know it is done away with for something else, it will no be there anymore. that's how it's harmed. if marriage is opened up to change everytime a group with a different sort of relationship comes along wanting it to be redefined, it would become something much more open-ended, broadened to meaninglessness. if that's not damage to an institution, i don't know what is."
1477,notsarc,then where do rights come from and how do you know they exist? i commented on the part i felt needed to be commented on.
1478,notsarc,"sure, no doubt. but, there are ways to be absolutely 100% sure that you don't get pregnant. the obvious way is not to have sex, but i know you won't settle for abstinance as an answer. that's way too religious for this site i suppose. obviously i cannot propose that no one have sex unless they want children. if someone doesn't want to ever have children and is willing to undergo an operation (abortion) to remove the possibility, why can they not simply have a different operation before practicing casual sex? this is true within marriage as well."
1479,notsarc,"'would the french accept people singing the la marseillaise in english as a sign of french patriotism? of course not,' there are so many flaws in this comparison it is unbelievable. firstly, there are virtually no french citizens for whom english is their first language. second, english isn't the national language of the us, nor is it a language that evolved there. a better comparison would be la marseillaise translated into bretagne, or translating 'oh canada' into french."

1482,notsarc,"appears i hit a nerve? i don't know why you put in the 'personal baggage' line...but ok. as for you not using the word 'hatred'...i admit you didn't, i did. if you say you don't then i'll take your word for it but your posts on these forums seem to make me think otherwise."
1483,notsarc,"yea...i'd say we're on a downhill slide. do you agree with talkorigins that most mutations (like 99%) lose information, lose specificity? mutations are destructive entities. they demolish and break down what was there. granted some of these may be beneficial but ulitmately the gene has lost information. and since selection works on the level of the whole organism, it cannot stop the loss of information on the molecular level. not only that, but natural selection has an i.q. of exactly zero -- as do random mutations -- so i believe the only way for the genome to go is downward. and if the only way for the genome to go is downward, then common sense says that neodarwinism is wrong. it's not just unlikely...it's not just improbably -- it's dead wrong and the whole hypothesis must be rejected."
1484,notsarc,but you have not shown how she would be harmed by equal marriage? i have shown that her definition infringes upon my religious freedom. if gay marriage becomes a reality then in no way does it infringe upon her in any way. would you care to explain how gay marriage infringes upon her in any way? it is her heterosexual privledge and her sence of entitlement that she is protecting not marriage.
1485,notsarc,"i think your post brings up a good point, and that's that to discuss torture, there needs to be a good understanding of what constitutes torture.  what are we talking about, exactly? just listening to loud music? loud music at 125 db 24/7 resulting in sleep deprivation? physical torture? or how about humiliation, like forced nakedness? simple prisoner punishment? having to eat a different diet? i think some things could be torture and some not, depending on the person being tortured, as well. it's a complicated subject--too complicated just to throw out some all-inclusive word like 'torture' and be able to adequately discuss it."
1486,notsarc,"using these words as you have explained them above, is it your view that the fetus is a human being (person), or is it your view that the fetus is merely human? the difference, of course, is that human beings deserve moral respect per se, whereas human parts do not per se (i.e., it is immoral to kill a human being, but it is not immoral to kill a tumor)."

1488,notsarc,"did you not say, 'these people need to be stopped?' or was that still part of the article? if that was you, then that is a viewpoint that, if implemented, will directly influence public policy. you say you do not want to make this country a theocracy, right? well, do you want to make it/keep it a non-theocracy? if so, you are trying to extend/keep an ideology imposed through government. i'm not saying that is bad; i am only saying it is what it is."
1489,notsarc,"what is the big deal here? so eharmony doesn't cater to gays. (there are also gay-only services out there that don't cater to straights.) if anyone doesn't like the service, they don't have to use it."
1490,notsarc,"read the rest of the post. i added to it before you responded to make what i said clearer: why would you be maligning them if they were not bad? the intended effect is that you would deserve the same maligning you were giving since what you were doing was equally as bad. since you malign something bad, it is generally understood to mean that the speaker considers you to be as bad as those you malign."
1491,notsarc,"and how do you know?? let's see evidence of this. or, it is just one of your proclamations?? that statement says to me 'i can close my eyes to all evidence, all common sense, because i believe in god'."
1492,notsarc,"rightio. i believe that a zygote is not a person i cannot prove it, but that i cannot does not mean i am wrong does it? so you have to accord my idea some significant merit."
1493,notsarc,"that's an interesting observation. by what means are you reasonably sure? do you think the other religions have the same take on it as you do? i used to think the same: if there is only one god, then they had to be worshipping the same, just giving him different names. then i was introduced to matt.7. clearly god only wants identifying (ex.6:3, 15:3 etc.) and worshipping one way, therefore all other religions have to be wrong. just a thought."
1494,notsarc,"most of sleezy's links let to nowhere. as usual. so, one has to ask. if gays are not alowed to marry why does the sleezball expect gay relationships to be 100% monogamous? is this an oxymoron or just a xxxxx? other studies were not scientific. someone recruited 60 people using leaflets. typical christer analysis. using data from 25 years ago on some of his family hate council propaganda. sleezy is as sleezy does. maybe his time would be better spent saving his fellow republican diddlers."
1495,notsarc,"just curious, but is bassman still a moderator? i remember he and giantoreo were mods not too long ago."
1496,notsarc,"really? congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; sounds like a requirement to be neutral to me. it could be rephrased: 'don't meddle with religion! do not regulate. neither promote nor inhibit.' why would anyone have a problem with this? and we both know that the limitation of government regulate of rights and liberties is read today, thanks to the 14th amendment, as applying to all legislative authorities in the us, not just congress. no state legislature can establish a state religion either."
1497,notsarc,"what specifically did he say to lead you to those conclusions? i don't know what speech you heard, but i have heard romney's religion speech as well as read it, and i see nothing there that declares war on secularism, or intimated that it's only believers who offer anything of worth, or that separation of church and state is bad. (in fact he defended separation of church and state.) the text of the speech is here (among plenty of other places accessible via google search) for people to draw their own conclusions."
1498,notsarc,"i've spoken favorably of religious believers who stand up for gay rights against a tyrannical version of christianity. what more do you want? blood? look, i disagree with the entire concept of religion. my view is that when religious believers support something that's right, they do it despite their religion, because it makes sense to them on the basis of humanitarian instincts, not religious ones. maybe sometimes their religion coincides with humanitarianism. all i can say to that is i wish it would do it more often than it does in practice!"
1499,notsarc,"so you get to whine and moan and complain (lie) that i didn't address your points, then when i challenge you to support your points against my counterarguments, you say that you don't need to. you're a hypocrite, archie.  ignore it? bhbcu64 made a valid point and made significant elaborations. the only responses we've seen are 'you're wrong' with no explanation, and two 'why does this follow?'s, apparently due to ignorance of that pesky little thing called law."
1500,notsarc,"good questions. its not a condition, i don't agree.  jesus doesn't open the lock to the pearly-gates for some people, he is the gate. do you see what i mean? that's what he said, 'i am the way... no one comes to the father except through me'. i think its like saying you shouldn't put conditions on the way into a house, you should be able to walk in from any spot - and saying that having to go through the door is a condition. why would people not choose heaven? its a hard road."
1501,notsarc,"this is rather naive. who would willing condemn themselves to hell? many people commit sins regardless of the punishment. here's a little conversation to save time... i understand texas has the death penalty. are there any muders still going on? yes. why? who would condemn themselves to death? some people don't think they're going to get caught. they don't want to die themselves, but they just plain think what they do, they can get away with."
1502,notsarc,"anyway..... back to the topic at hand. will you sign the nogaymarriage petition? it has gained significant momentum in the past month.  there are now over 1 million people who have signed it. as well, there are now 38 states that have banned gay marriage within their borders. all that would be needed in addition to these 38 states ratifying the amendment within their state would be the approval of 2/3 of congress. send a message to congress. sign the petition.... emoticonxgood"
1503,notsarc,"of course i know that i could be wrong but i would have to be proven wrong through rational arguement, not just claims. have you ever stopped to think that perhaps you could be wrong? either way, we already discussed this issue of whether people can have opinions about abortion law. perhaps you are having a 'senior moment' and don't remember our discussion. i really don't feel like repeating this whole discussion all over again for your benefit. indeed, you do seem to repeat your questions quite often. if you don't like someone's answer, don't just repeat the question - address their answer. if you don't remember our discussion, it started pretty much around post #861. unless you have something new to say that we didn't already discuss, then i think we pretty much covered it and left it at a disagreement."
1504,notsarc,"because it shows that your data is not absolute, and that there is supporting evidence for both sides? it also stops you justifiably saying things like... the data speaks for itself. in america, guns save more lives than are taken by them. fact. did you know that in the uk, i am statistically at least twice less likely to be killed than you? fact. it works both ways..."

1506,notsarc,"no? i've looked up your name, and once separated from the historical galileo figure, yours seems to be exclusively on boards talking about gun control, and you always seem to be using the actions of criminals as grounds for calling for evermore gun control."
1507,notsarc,"so you're admitting that this law will worsen some childrens lives? so lets say they feared violence? do you think it is right for them to face their potential abusers and tell them something they don't want to tell? my point exactly. the first one said plenty. there is nothing wrong with the second. what sources that parents or children may face great bodily harm or injury if this law were not enacted have you provided? in order to pass a law, you need a little more than 'there has been little problems so far'. who is it significantly benefiting and why? oh, god forbid my argument be evolutionary and logical emoticonxrolleyes."
1508,notsarc,"i think you're missing the point. why would you want to keep people under control? to prevent them from harming other people. the men who created the commandments and the bible i believe had good intentions. they wanted to give people a reason to live their lives well, and the bible was the best and most intelligent thinking of the time (not modern, ancient). it was a good idea, however people started looking past the 'love thy neighbor' stuff and started focusing on unimportant things like homosexuality and abortion. so, my question is why is homosexuality a sin?"
1509,notsarc,"how does this change the fact that it was a defeat? guns had an effect, i don't doubt that they would - but not enough. i was using a tactic known as 'using omega's own arguments against himself'. i think that a gun ban would have a drastic effect on gun ownership levels. you have often disagreed. i'm just pointing out it's logically inconsistent for you to maintain both arguments."
1510,notsarc,"nope. dead serious. life is hard.  none. how about you? none. how about you? i have a lot more than 3 sets. how often...dont know how to count that. the service comes on tuesdays and thursdays. now....the question that actually matters (as opposed to the above that are just silly). how many decisions have i made that were so bad that they left me homeless, destitute, and with only 3 sets of clothing? none. how about you?  excellent bit of misdirection."
1511,notsarc,"i agree that his motivation for believing as he does is self serving, but is that any reason to abandon capitalism for a welfare state mentality? well, i guess if ones motivation is based in selfishness, it would be their reason. sorry, i answered my own question. emoticonxwow emoticonxgood"
1512,notsarc,"good question.  let us say that dawkins is my teacher.  in the ben stien interview , dawkins said that evolution is fact, as much of a fact, as we can know anything to be a fact... ok?!?! dawkins also says that we do not know how life originates from inornanic, nonliving compounds and he says, that, he doesn't know and no one else does either. ok!!?! well i do not accept that as an explanation - so - i guess i am not blindly following this irrational line of logic. i would have to say that - i am not being 'indoctinated'. at the same time, dawkins has nothing to teach me so i guess i am not being 'educated' either. hmmm. i guess i would have to say that in this case i am - neither."
1513,notsarc,"the scientificly proven fact that the baby has unique human dna from the moment of conception is not by my  authority.  how else would we define someone as a person? i can see alot of flaws in determining a persons rights by their size, color or level of independence."
1514,notsarc,"so who should make the choice in the scenario you propose? for me, it must always and forever be the woman. btw, why is it in your example that the man is not the one who refused to use birth control? in any case, i do not want the nanny state involved in the most intimate choice a woman will ever have to make. btw, who is simone?"
1515,notsarc,"simple answer? dc has a lot less budget than the usa government. more complex answer? just looking at the commuters, there are over 400,000 people that come to work in dc every day (see link in my last post). making the preposterous assumption that they all come in at a constant flow, just looking at 400,000 of them and assuming that you would only check them coming in, that's ~4.6 people admitted per second for every second of the working week. good luck with that. good luck with convincing people that it's constitutional, as well - airports get away with it, but only because there is such a (largely unfounded) fear of death by terrorist that they can get away with something which is constitutionally shady. a quick search gave me two relevant results almost immediately."
1516,notsarc,"well can you point to an instance, either in canada or the united kingdom, where the government mandated firearm registries have been instrumental in solving any number of vicious and felonious crimes? i'm not talking about catching people who let their registration lapse, or those who told their spouses about the location of their gun locker keys, i'm talking about serious crimes like murder and robbery and others. can you provide us with any evidence that would point to how the registries have helped solve any such happenings?"
1517,notsarc,"we are not talking about genesis as a story are we? we are talking about bilbical creation. you really are thick arent you? i know there are religious people, deeply and otherwise who accept the story of genesis as a story but that has no relevance to the thread. undisputable is only stupid because you cant provide it. certainly not as comprehensively as the aristotlian view of the universe was disproved. the horse evolution thread was fine...you have showed a little horse turning into a big horse and not one species actually evolving into another distinct species but i'll give you the benefit of the doubt. now show exactly how life originated and you're home and dry."
1518,notsarc,"how did you private insurer determine the coverage in your plan? do they ever make case-by-case determinations not to cover something? i strongly urge you not only to read the house bill and the upcoming senate bill, but also to read your own health insurance plan, in detail, fine print and all, as well as to look into their record of denying claims. it's one of those things that most people don't realize is a problem until it affects them directly, at which point it's too late."
1519,notsarc,how would a person like you explain a civil right? it has always been a right enshrined in the constitution against all infringement from without or within by any government. is that slow enough for you? too complex and complicated? cops have no duty to protect you so good luck on your own old chap :)
1520,notsarc,"once again when is my life, what i do, and who i love, who i marry, any more thier business then theirs is to me? you still haven't answered my question. why do they get a say in my life yet i don't get the same say in their lives? anyone who wants to but into other peoples lives in the way these religious xxxxxx are is just cruel and evil. it is my life my family not theirs. they get theirs yet try and stop me from having mine that is unjust. you are defending an unjust system."
1521,notsarc,"in your opinion symbiote, is it proper or not to simply assume that self avowed racists who join racist groups with well known and advertised racist agendas are exactly what they claim to be? i mean, some things just go without saying since the people themselves declare their hatred and animosity toward those who are different from themselves. it seems ridiculous to me to assert that even avowed racists can't be proven to be what they claim to be. and why isn't racism evil? how can you say it isn't wrong or bad in and of itself? i don't understand how you can say that."
1522,notsarc,"the government has no business invading into the private, legal activities of two individuals. and how is requirement able to defeat straw purchasers? if you don't feel comfortable making the sale, don't make it. it's as simple as that."

1524,notsarc,"quote: originally posted by doc jones  i don't have to 'guess again'. i posted barrett's letters and they haven't changed.  did you read the letters? he excluded kalifornia, not border states for their banning the .50 cal. in your state. prove ronnie barrett is selling or repairing leo .50 calibers in kalifornia. with such assuredness, surely you have evidence to back up that mockingbird mouth? :)"

1527,notsarc,"that's the finals tournament. are you being deliberately obtuse? there are qualifying rounds that eliminate many teams before the finals competition. you will notice, therefore, that neither scotland, wales nor northern ireland are involved in the finals competition, though you can be assured that they participated vigorously in the qualifying rounds. 2010 fifa world cup qualification - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 204 teams entered the most recent qualification competitions."
1528,notsarc,"world population above 'equilibrium'? hardly. i don`t even think there is an equilibrium to find. how would that work? is it based on food production? because if that`s the case, we are currently not even close to utilising the food production to max. resource depletion? because if that`s the case, we are constantly discovering new ways to use and create materials. the destruction of our enviroment? that is not even closely related to population (but rather consumption of certain goods)"

1530,sarc,"Then why do you call a politican who ran such measures liberal? OH yes, it's because you're a republican and you're not a conservative at all."
1531,sarc,"Spanking doesn't teach children to defend themselves against violence. It teaches them the exact opposite because they are forced to submit to these acts of violence *and* they are told it's being done out of love. Do you ever wonder what conditions some women and men to accept violence from their partner? Do you ever wonder how they could not recognize it as abuse? I'll give you three guesses. Different personalites process and categorize information in different ways. Unfortunately for many children, this is one of them. :( And unfortunately I'm speaking from experience."
1532,sarc,"WOW this seems to be an attitude of controlling womens sex lives by banning abortion.So forcing women to have children she doesn't want, his her version of the scarlet letter? Having children is selfish BTW.(from an evolutionary standoint).

1536,sarc,"aye, 'at they did and it was quite plain that they were priviledges and immunities of the people only. the packing of scotus by lincoln and later by liberal roosevelt and his hand picked crooks caused a great deal of confusion. about the same old, same old is going on now but it appears that this one may be in a great deal of difficulty? ha, ha, ha. ma, ma, where's pa? gone to the white house ha,ha, ha.(only a texan would understand that)"
1537,sarc,"feel like taking another frustration break? i already informed you that scientists (including evolutionists) have no reason to make stuff up. secondly, you say that as if there is no evidence for evolution, but there actually is. have you bothered to look at this evidence? a written article is the base for the evidence for evolution, because a peer reviewed article entails research and testing. once reviewed and accepted by the scientific community, that evidence is easily defendable for supporting evolution by just about anyone who pays attention. so stop making empty claims, and tell us two things: 1, what is your evidence against evolution and 2, what is your evidence to support id?"
1538,sarc,"and taking a stand against the wickedness of religion isn't either. one difference however is we whom do don't base our motivation and reasoning on myths and fairy tales. oh please... grow up. can't you let go about what other people do and just live your own life? i suppose not because your own life must be so miserable and stale you feel you need to butt heads with anyone who has a slightly more enjoyable life than you do. lol. who are you? the westboro jimmy cricket? i love how you toss in politics that your side can do no wrong, and is incapable of it until black bold letter stare back at you in the paper saying just how messed up and hypocritical you on the fringe right truly are."

1546,sarc,"'force our beliefs'? did we kick down some people's doors or something? you're quite deranged, you know. if i as a christian, with other folks like me, decide to vote to outlaw gay marriage, and we prevail, then that's constitutional. and if we have enough votes we can even legally do an amendment to the constitution declaring gay sex illegal in america. that would be constitutional also. the taliban doesn't like people voting and will instill their beliefs by force, not be ballot. and that's where your thinking is deranged. and dan savage is a hypocrite and is also deranged. that would be chapter 1 of romans for the sodomites to review."
1547,sarc,"apparently you need to read up on up-to-date cases of fetus viability and premature birth success statistics. that's right, and she does it after the baby is born by caring for it as well. so? i guess you'd also be in favor of it being legal for a mother to not allow her baby to live because she has to care for it after it's born too, with that reasoning. there are many, many women in the pro-life movement. my wife is one of them and she is a lot more passionate about it than i am. (trust me, you don't want to be in a room with her after you've killed a baby!) if you think this is a men versus women issue, you are sadly mistaken."
1548,sarc,i am looking for you to recognize that a pregnancy can't successfully happen without addressing the circumstances of the mother - whatever those may be. you can dismiss everything but health/life of the mother but i can pretty damned well assure you she won't. and whether you like it or not - the pregnancy can't succeed without her. get it? she is not a barbie you can bend to your will with law. do you see her? do you recognize that babies grow and live inside women? address all her issues or you will fail in your endeavors. oh - and i don't require your sympathy - my life is great.
1549,sarc,"by your logic, do i have to be a murdered to understand that murder is wrong? this 'walk a mile in my sandals' stuff is just bs. i don't have to be a woman to view abortion as not being moral."

1552,sarc,"ok to lie?? no. having people preaching 'the evolution of species from a cell to every living creature and plant life on earth', and tell me 'its darwin's origin of species, you should try reading it sometime', after i had just presented them an entire paragraph from hitler's meine kempf - entertaining! having your beloved talkorigins crew flunk the test straight-up as they were asked, 'who said the following, _________, hitler or darwin?', while going a whopping 0-3 for a revealing score of zero............ ...............priceless!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1553,sarc,"what are you talking about?!?! the constitution was written in the late 1700's we have to go by thier meaning not a modern interpretation, this is most silly. as for your quote on adams i do not see how that even remotley applies to this discussion... care to expound?"

1556,sarc,"yes, how silly of me to debate him on 'points'. i should debate him on .... what? and here you are again criticising one side, and not the other. he was insulting; you remained stony silent. because he denies that darwin ever used it. darwin did. small point but he entered into all sorts of highly spurious rationales rather than accepting this point (again you were stony silent on this) what is evolution? what is evidence? well that would be a first time. but why ask now, after several days, after he's gone by the wayside, after he made the claim again and again and again? you made no statement while he was claiming this false claim? why your sudden interest in digging all posts i've responded too?"
1557,sarc,"i agree, let him rest in peace. however... this disgusts me! how can you say his good deeds outweigh his anti-gay sentiments? i could pass out money and food to the poor and homeless, cure cancer, invent the longer lasting lightbulb, and run around shouting racial slurs at blacks while fighting to take away their rights. but hey, at least the good that i did outweighs the last part right? it's not like i am the grand-dragon of the klan right? sure, intolerance and bigotry are ok as long as you do good things to outweigh them. emoticonxrolleyes i am certainly not trying to spit on his grave...but 5 good acts do not erase 1 bad act. oppresion against anyone is not a christian value...or so i heard."
1558,sarc,i will ask you yet again who these nefarious 'gay lobbist' are that you continually refer to? how do you define 'lobbist'. merriam-webster on line dictionary http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=lobbyists are you not yourself a 'lobbyist'? many times one thinks of a lobbyist as one who is paid to present a particular point of view. with that in mind: 1) are you receiving wages during the time you spend reading and posting on this forum? i am not. 2) is the person or organization paying you those wages aware of the nature your activities here in this forum? 3) does the person or organization paying you those wages advocate the nature of your opinions and activities expressed here in this forum? 3) are you using equipment or facilities provided by some other person or organization to read and make postings here?

1560,sarc,"or get a hybrid. or carpool.  but it is quite impossible to reason financially with one who holds the most idiotic of fisical ideas.  it still amuses me that vor thinks a cd during low inflation is a good idea. hey, why is it that vor has cowardly fled from virtually every argument i met him in? btw vor, everytime you say something that is just financially idiotic, i'm going to bring up the cd comment."
1561,sarc,"yes, yes, im completely asinine. how does that improve your position? asinine or not, you have no logical rejoinder. please explain why you dont tithe. ted bundy killed young women; you failed to tithe. explain the difference according to your take on morality. you still have no answer. months and months to prepare, and here you are still unprepared. your pretense is typically human. you left your considered answer in your other suit. come. come. are we really to believe that if you could present an argument that you wouldnt? the problem is not my asininity, but that your belief in morals is an illusion. simple question: why dont you tithe?"
1562,sarc,"are you a little bit retarded or something? don't get me wrong sleazyrider i love babies, they're delicious!"
1563,sarc,to take the pis out on others? seems like the thing to do. if you're here to learn...consider your teachers... there are more effective means of acquiring knowledge and insight than to sit around and gab with your mentally defective peers.
1564,sarc,"you must be talking to somebody not in this thread because no one here likes to burn flags. how much of posts do you actually read?  poor nurglitch.  some possible outcomes of this. 1) all the 'socialists' end up in jail, for a victimless crime. 2) all the 'socialists' leave. turning america into a more rightwing, conservative society 3) other forms of dissent become more widespread, 'seditious' literature, riots, even acts of terrorism. result - more socialists in jail, lots of injury and damage. how are any of these good things? we should see this for what it really is - political 'one-up-manship' against 'lefties'"
1565,sarc,"man what have you been sniffing? an overdose on prozac perhaps? ever heard of religious freedom? this is not the crusades. who were the ones who flew planes into the twin towers? who was it who caused man,women.children to be burnt to death, or fjump to their death? who is responsile for the nyc firefighter who looks in the mirror and weeps for his fallen comrades? how dare you!"
1566,sarc,really? i was unaware of that the ritual of moloch was revived in modern-day medical abortions. seems odd not to support the punishment of such sinful infants then if you're only in favour of innocent life.  cool. does that mean i get to say rude things about you and yours?
1567,sarc,"wow, that's a huge blanket statement which you haven't bothered to qualify. guess that means it's just a personal attack because you had no better argument, huh?  just because someone does not like what society has become does not necessarily mean one hates the concept of structural society. unfortunately you haven't qualified either concept in your ad hominem attack of jake."
1568,sarc,"ok, i'll repeat what duo_maxwell has said, that you are a facist. why are you so insulted by being called that? if it quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, it must be a facist. we moderates are proud to be moderates, why don't you like to be called what you truly are? same logic here, right?"
1569,sarc,"and that has what to do with my right of dissent? as i have stated before, and reinforced by your response, i don't need a laser to follow a dimwit. it is apparent to all here that there is a great deal you don't know and the definition of seniority is the least of the lot. since i give little weight to the inquiry of a simpleton, i will ignore your question re my birth. dono"
1570,sarc,"well, did making incest illegal result in women's lifes being put in jeopardy ? because making abortion illegal sure will !"
1571,sarc,yet saddams wmd record of 20 years ago still counts? emoticonxrolleyes  pot. kettle. black.
1572,sarc,"orion, the world wants to know who your so-called 'god' is that approves of gay sex? where can we read about this divine individual, and what basis in fact is there for it????? recommendation: least you think your opinion is worth something, try basing it on something other than what the carnal liberal mindset craves. come out of sodom. come out of gomorrah. flee from the coming wrath!!!"
1573,sarc,"is this the pro-sodomite woman talking here? where does it say in the bible that defending carnal iniquity and sodomy makes one feel squeaky clean like you claim to be?  where does jesus then say that defending carnal iniquity and sodomy is something that he and god approve of? obviously you have created a carnal, iniquity-loving jesus that's different than the jesus of the bible. one more time now, preppy: where does jesus say that defending carnal iniquity and sodomy is something that he and god approve of? got a scripture where he says gay sex sin suddenly became a righteous endeavor? obviously you have created a carnal, iniquity-loving jesus that's different than the jesus of the bible. so go preach that trash to someone who's buying it."
1574,sarc,"strange. doesn't abkhazia border russia? why would they rely on 'flour' from turkey to feed people, rather than requesting aid from russia? what are we supposed to respond to? isn't georgia allowed to import military equipment suddenly? they have a huge near-dictatorship to their north called russia. russia tried to interfere with both the georgian and abkhazian presidential elections to keep them under russia's control. russia has thousands of troops stationed in georgia. the interference failed and russia has been told to get it's troops out. perhaps that is what you are really moaning about: another european state seeking to align itself with nato and the eu rather than russia?"
1575,sarc,"ah yes, bush can never be to blame. he is a god, and therefore is never wrong. ever. all praise the great leader bush, for in his infinite wisdom he has decreed that our sons and daughters be sacrificed upon the mantle of unnecesary war. who are we to question his intelligence? we are nothing but the dirt upon which his blessed feet trample. no, it is not bush we should be blaming, but instead, those dirt, murderous and depraved liberals! how dare they speak of world peace. emoticonxrolleyes"
1576,sarc,"is that canard still being repeated? ho hum, wilful ignorance is so utterly boring. so impossible to bring wisdom about under such circumstances. it just goes to show what happens when you don't know about even the recent history of the world. saddam complained to ambassador april glasspie that the kuwaitis were slant-drilling into oil pools under iraqi territory and ambassador glasspie replied, quite properly, that a dispute of that nature was not a us concern. saddam then invaded kuwait, speciously claiming that kuwait was historically the 19th province of iraq."
1577,sarc,"role confusion? jaaman, you are no scientists and certainly ot a mental health counselor. you have no idea why she is gay anymore than sciene knows. yet hhere you are explaining to a women why she is a lesbian. why don't you just say 'i don't know why your gay' and stop lying anout what makes people gay. you have no clue...so why pretend you knwo something you don't/  this is what we talked about on the other board. you spread lies and untruths that are not based in fact. where did you get this rocket science theory that a bad experience with a man, made her gay. that is silly, not to mention inaccurate.."
1578,sarc,'positive' atheism? now there's a contradiction of terms if i ever saw one.
1579,sarc,would you like some cheese with that whine? emoticonxrolleyes btw this only shows over 60+ years of liberal government incompetence.
1580,sarc,"jo bennett -  first, 'allah' must be schizophrenic not to recognize jesus as his only begotten son, and not to recognize him as divine (god - john 1:1, titus 2:13, 2 peter 1:1, etc.). can you tell me how allah got so forgetful? second, jesus said to love your enemies (matthew 5:44). allah says to kill them. salvation in christianity is by faith (john 3:16, romans 3, ephesians 2:8-9, etc.) and one can know they are saved (john 5:24). in islam, salvation is by works and you never know if you're saved until you die.  you'll never in the least convince me allah is the same as the god of judaism / christianity. you've been watching too much oprah winfrey."
1581,sarc,howard -  who do you say jesus christ is? the long awaited jewish messiah? your resurrected savior for the remission of your sins? the great god and savior (2 peter 1:1)? simple yes's or no's will suffice. p.s. you can probably buy that book i recommended on your argument at amazon.com.
1582,sarc,"oh... isn't that just soooo bad??? i mean, after all, brown is such an erudite in this matter, isn't he? his words are just set in stone... he should have just attacked the church and opus dei more so more ignorant people could believe all the xxxx he wrote and be militant atheists without an agenda beyod that of attacking religion. what is it with you and the chuch? do you even know what opus dei is? do you know what it preaches? haven't you no argument that stands on its own, and doesn't need to be founded on some attack on christianity? defend something, don't just attack what you don't comprehend."
1583,sarc,"trebor, is there any odd chance that you are some what familiar with coptic christian traditions? i don't really expect it of you but i suspect that you may have spent a wee bit of time investigating other religions."
1584,sarc,"ever read job chapter 1 (etc.) in the tanakh? your boy satan is right there and that's over 1,000 years before christianity. christ is the only way to salvation (john 14:6, acts 4:12, etc.)."
1585,sarc,am i psychic or what! didnt i predict that there would be those who would avoid my question? am i good or what!
1586,sarc,"small explosive device 3' from your butt, eh? i'm guessing that if you make a mistake, you'll be singing soprano. emoticonxwow emoticonxwow  my son and i have been mounting a kirkey racing seat in his car, getting it ready for its first outing next weekend in bama. emoticonxgood"
1587,sarc,"so, because you are ignorant, you change yoru position rather than look at the information? there is plenty of evidence there.  but, to each their own."
1588,sarc,"well, then again, we all know the kind of people the nmbla consists of. sick freaks, everyone of them. they have their reasons. chinese girls start their period at three years old hmmm? sorry for the skepticism, but i don't buy it. i can't imagine a three year old starting their period. how is a body like that supposed to sexually mature?"
1589,sarc,"only for christians. what about the many jews who do not consider those laws repealed? should their religious mandates be written into u.s. law? should bacon and shrimp cocktail be banned? why not? surely this is a 'moral issue' (meaning, according to one poster, no further logical justification necessary) to the hassidim, is it not? and surely the laws about stoning to death adulterers, disobedient children, and--yes--'men who lay with men' aren't 'dietary' rules. are we to assume those are still in effect? or have we suddenly gone all picky-choosey, i.e., hypocritically bigotted? one doesn't have to be a rocket scientist to answer that question."
1590,sarc,"i have never heard a conservative who was pro gay let alone pro same sex marriage. do you know of any? there is an old term that seems to apply 'if the shoe fits'. please i would like to know who these conservatives are that want gay people to be able to legally marry. who are they? since as you say i speak in generalities then you should have no problem listing these pro gay or por gay marriage conservatives. just because someone believes that the government should not be in the marriage busisness, as a libertarian, doesn't mean they support gay marriage."
1591,sarc,"you mean preponderance of nothing. there is no preponderance of evidence, especially physical evidenc, to support the existance of any god.  guess what? historians can't replicate historic events and personalities than scientists can either."
1592,sarc,"what did i previously tell you, i.e. well hey, moose, you're in a topic which highly relates to the bible. if you want a secular response there's plenty of those guys around. if you want to chat with me i'll usually be coming from a biblical perspective. but i'll be glad to talk with you on a secular subject if you want. what are you looking for? p.s. please hold your 'honest attempts at discussion' rants, ok? i could easily claim the same with you since you are out of god's wisdom. but i won't. what did you want to know? again, what did you want to know?"
1593,sarc,"but my definition is one that conforms to reality. i have to, because you never seem to do too well. in fact, if you had bothered to pay attention to my explanation of my use of the word ignorance in post 195, you'd have realized that i meant not 'utter stupidity' but rather 'lack of knowledge' (in your case due to completely ignoring all disliked points). instead, you simply proved my point. what's this, yet another non-response with a thinly-veiled ad hominem attack? now everyone can see why i have to answer my own posts..."
1594,sarc,"since you are so oblivious to the truth, and probably flunked science a couple of times: http://www.mala.bc.ca/~johnstoi/essays/courtenay1.htm http://newton.nap.edu/html/creationism/evidence.html http://www.thekeyboard.org.uk/the%20...g%20theory.htm http://www.umich.edu/~gs265/bigbang.htm fact listen: [ fkt ] n.  knowledge or information based on real occurrences: an account based on fact; a blur of fact and fancy.  a. something demonstrated to exist or known to have existed: genetic engineering is now a fact. that chaucer was a real person is an undisputed fact. see above. http://www.carm.org/abortion/embryo.htm a piece of my hair is of the homo sapein species too. does that mean my hair is a person? perhaps you need to get your 'facts' straight."
1595,sarc,"thats total baloney. one has nothing to do with the other. you are trying to confuse the subject with this drivel. when a powerful leader makes a decision peoples lives are effected. bush decision hurt people, period. why? so he can have the luxury of compliance with his silly religious beliefs."
1596,sarc,"so you agree simple foreknowledge is not determinism in the way i explained it? if so, can you explain that to electrolyte, who is having a terrible time coming to grips with that? he has omnipotent foreknowledge about future events, is the way i would put it."
1597,sarc,"that is an utter contradiction. he knows what is going to happen, but wants to preserve our freedom of choice? what freedom? please, explain so i can understand, this 'freedom' which gives rise to only one possible future! the existence of a god who can see the future implies we have no choice in shaping our destiny. no ifs, buts or maybes. this isn't about god deciding our future, it's about whether we can. well, that's one interpretation. another would be 'not sticking our heads in the sand'."
1598,sarc,"''they'll come up with hundreds, sometimes even thousands of products relating to homosexuality [and promotion of] the agenda of the homosexual community,' sharp told christian publication agape.' i would be fascintaed, and probably highly amused, to see what products they think are promoting the homosexual agenda. it would probably be a wonderful peek inside their rather twisted little minds. i mean, what are they talking about? astroglide? silk boxers? potted ferns? the mind boggles at what they might be afraid of here. oh noes! my son just saw a teletubbies tape on that rack, now he's going to catch gayness!!"
1599,sarc,"then why do you respond? the ignore function works quite well. 'if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out.' violence on screen or in real life is pornographic!"
1600,sarc,"are you telling me that my pubes are sentient? i agree, however i am no constitutional expert."
1601,sarc,any idea on when this will happen? i want to buy a cheaply made house when it hits rock bottom...on the water....from the bank that took the foreclosed house and is selling it for three times less than what was paid for it. :)
1602,sarc,"are you kidding? uh, i hate wasting my 1000th post on you, but here goes. i don't believe that the pm was vile and profane, because jitobear doesn't do that unless you get her really ###### off. second, you're not the most credible person on this forum. and no one has lost it. maybe in your mind, but not in reality. is this how you react when you're cornered, when your bible rhetoric fails? because its kind of pathetic."
1603,sarc,"would you rather have them be born with down's or not? it all depends on what comes out of the mothers, well, you know. whether it has down's or not is the question. i believe that abortion a couple of cells is not killing anyone, that that a new mental existence would be born in its place. therefore if a defective cell or two was aborted, and the parents decided to have a new baby and carry it to term, in my eyes they are the same baby, since one didn't have a mental existence."
1604,sarc,"and your kids go to private school yes? so you want higher teen pregnancy, more abortions and more sexually transmitted diseases?  if you are disagreeing with my statement that you want all of those lower, then you are admitting you either want them to increase or stay the same. as you have railed against abortion, it would appear you're being contradictory. make up your mind. and yet they have lower rates. funny how that works.  no. in the seven years since introduction 620,000 or so european women have used it. so that's around 88,000 abortions a year. 1.2 million happen in the us annually. as the population of europe is around the same as the us, it's not a valid point. 88k to 1.2 million is nothing.  plan b isn't abortion. try me."
1605,sarc,are you serious? emoticonxwow you might have to explain that one to me.
1606,sarc,"no, you didn't. in fact, you are only semi-literate and you are now lying in an effort to make it seem as if it were intentional. isn't lying a sin? so your intent was to make christians look like fools? good job! whether it is wrong isn't the point. the 'quote' is only semi-literate and should be embarrassing. sadly, semi-literacy is rarely embarrassing to creationists. that's nonsense. maybe if it wasn't semi-literate and didn't make me look like a fool. or even if it had some actual meaning. but not a foolish statement that conflates evolution with atheism and rocks. atheism, rocks, and evolution are unrelated. to try to relate them as some logical position is either dismally ignorant or completely stupid. hey, but no one ever accused a creationists of being smart."
1607,sarc,"'lame apologetics'? well, i guess if you say so, with your invincible assurance of being right whenever you open your mouth, it would be futile to contradict you.  at least you haven't accused me of being 'prejudiced' against science.  james."
1608,sarc,"** well, that's the kind of thing a self-confessed clown would find funny. which is probably why so many of you clowns are either depressing or scary. what else amuses you? little cars, huge feet, and rubber noses? they would be on a par with chemist's offering, in terms of wit and intelligence."
1609,sarc,"'blah blah blah'? look, you weighed in here on what i said, making an issue of whether it was internal, empatically making a point that it was action. as i said, i'm basically agreeing with you on the whole thing here about there needing to be equality in this situation, so i don't know why you're being so eager to find something to disagree over here."
1610,sarc,"and yet who gets to say what god's truth is? apparently only you. anyone who disagrees with you is a damned sinner. so i really don't think i'm that far wrong here. well, one might say that only god's opinion matters in the long run, sure. but that doesn't stop the rest of us from forming opinions now, does it? and believing that you have a better grasp of the divine will than pretty much everybody else in the world? in my opinion that's about as arrogant as you can get. but since you only care what god thinks, and you get to decide what you think god thinks, i guess that doesn't bother you all that much. emoticonxgood"
1611,sarc,and i suppose they are also responsible for the evolution of utterly insane mental cases such as yourself? and for electing gbii. and for saddam hussein. and for the drought in the south currently. and for cancer and aids. and heck why stop there why not for the devil himself. all those sodomites must have become the original demons in hell i suppose.emoticonxbouncer
1612,sarc,"well it came from somewhere and presumably changed as it went along.  careful there that ones been clearly shown to be the case - in a laboratory environment to boot. not to mention in the form of a hydrogen bomb! you mean that the planets and stars have always existed? really - so how come we see stars being made in nurseries via the hubble telescope. so you don't believe that life had an origin! wow so you think its always been present on the earth? not even the bible goes that far! and you fail to account for the observation that there is life. thats not an evolutionary theory, at least not a scientific one. kinds is a theological construct not a biological one and most creationists use the kinds thing as a support for their arguments."
1613,sarc,"hmmm. 'wow... and this op made it through the rigorous admin review process? anyway, here is a question for you to ponder about. if god made human from dirt, how come there are still dirt around?' sounds like a joke to me.  evc forum: human evolution (re: if evolved from apes, why still apes?) but we all know that arch is incapable of opening the blue colored links."
1614,sarc,"what are you talking about? cosmic? what do the cosmos have to do with evolution outside of causing extinctions?  and macroevolution is a observable fact.  when has that ever happened? abiogenesis is life from non-life. evolution cannot occur without life. your 'debate' and i question the use of that word is a train wreck and that's before it even gets put together. do you enjoy making up terms that no one in a respectable field has ever used? evolution is the change in allele frequencies over time. how can something that has no alleles, much less be alive be a part of evolution? again, this is a train wreck.  you actually think this is even close to being ready? hahahaha"
1615,sarc,"so, no answering argument, then. thought not. after all, why argue when flinging insults is so much easier? odd, though, that you should be so thin-skinned about others insulting you."
1616,sarc,"who said anything about you hating me? oh! i get it. i support gay rights, therefore i'm gay, right? you might want to trying checking those prejudices and misconceptions at the door archie, they're not doing you any favors."
1617,sarc,"jt, france has health care for everyone and a university education if you can pass the grade. are they, too, a bunch of 'socialist pigs'? seems to me you have a kind of boogie man in your head, i.e. superstitious beliefs, not anything based on reason."
1618,sarc,"explain to me how a dragon would get off the ground and fly. the sheer necessary muscle would be more then the available mass of the organism as similar to the necessary requirements to merely run for a t-rex.  how many several ton animals can fly on thermals?  please, if you think you understand anything in the realm of reason, explain to us how a dragon weighing several tons could fly.  or does he need a jet engine strapped to his butt?  hahha. you're never going to hear the end of that one."
1619,sarc,is there an analogy here somewhere? perhaps instead of having a penalty box there should be gallows or a guillotine. please ellaborate. smiley
1620,sarc,"and a few posts later you whined about ad homs. maybe you could support that? perhaps you would prove to us that we are truly vile, evil, callous, despicable people that deserve to burn in the firey depths of hell for the murders that each and every one of us has committed? or perhaps you wouldn't."
1621,sarc,"you don't win squat. name the hominid that has been conclusively identified via dna evidence as man's immediate, direct line ancestor. who is that bad boy??? name that mother or you're busted."
1622,sarc,"show me the post where i want a theocracy or eat it.  back at you.  god creates life in a mothers womb (psalm 139:13, etc.).  you can't stand the truths in the bible, can you? you have to hem and haw and do a barack obama and try to spin it away. it's not working for you, pappi. jesus is the resurrected savior and god creates life. and you can't stand the truth."
1623,sarc,i did not realize there were people who actually believed the recession was over until i got on google news today and saw this: u.s. retail sales unexpectedly drop as jobs evaporate (update2) - bloomberg.com unexpectedly? where in the hell have these people who were not expecting it been?  the sun unexpectedly rose this morning.......
1624,sarc,"http://www.4forums.com/political/cre...-fields-2.html did he ask you to come here like he did several other of his friends?  http://www.4forums.com/political/352101-post27.html t.q specifically criticizes yec. how does arch respond? by linking a site to a christian geologists. not a yec geologists website, but a christian one. (interestingly enough, one essay on that website rejects yec. who are creationists? -david dathe) why would he do such a thing if he didn't think they were the same thing?  why would he link a christian website rather than a yec website when everyone else was talking strictly about yec and not about christanity?  simple answer: he thinks the two are the same thing."
1625,sarc,"is that what penfold was saying? that is why antis can't be trusted with gun control laws! they use them to criminalize the law-abiding, for doing common sense things. however i guess that should be of little surprise to me. he is english and england has for all intent and practical purposes criminalized self defense.   uk: once more, once more into the morass, my friends...  "
1626,sarc,"yes, it's david koresh's fault that the fbi burnt children alive, right? disgusting. however evil or deluded david koresh might have been, nothing he did compares to gassing and then setting on fire large numbers of children, an act you apparently applaud."
1627,sarc,you kidding? ez can't see past the front of his cobwebbed skull.
1628,sarc,"exactly. archangel, when americans travel for health care, because they can't afford it here, and if they can afford to go anywhere else, they now high-tail to india or mexico. where the nations rank much lower than ours. didn't you hear that was one of the plans from your lovely health insurance companies next time you need open heart surgery? instead of doing anything about the united states ... take a plane to the third world, baby. :wink: ------- 61 mexico 112 india (hope you speak spanish or indo-aryan, fluently, and are quite comfortable with caste systems .. meaning, too, you don't ask the doctors any questions ... oh but what's a little plane ride? and they have mcdonald's there, too ...)"
1629,sarc,"sure. god commanded faithfulness in marriage. yet he never even raised an eyebrow at abraham inpregnating his maid, and went on to bestow blessings on him like it never happened. god commanded you should not steal. yet moses' brilliant idea of having the israelites borrow gold and jewelry from the egyptians they knew they never were going to repay seemed mildly humorous to god at the time. god commanded that noone should make graven images of him or anything in heaven. so what's the deal with the ark of the covenant? and the number of instances god commanded his people to kill, shortly after commanding them not to kill, well this could become a pretty long post.  i know you asked for one, but i just started rambling because so many came to mind. pick one if you want."
1630,sarc,"[quote=jpsartre12;365057]wasn't that your boy, clinton, that screwed the intern? or was it mayor sam adams of portland who screwed a 17 year old intern? no wait, it couldn't have been adams, that intern was a boy. emoticonxrolleyes [quote] billy boy didn't run on 'family values', yet the recent splurge of republicans who are getting caught , such senetor stanley, did. oh, and we must not forget john ensign, john foley, larry craig, david vetter, and vito fossella. billy boy sure did wrong, and definitely had his willy where it shouldn't have gone. but, yes,,,.. the religious right is definitely showing it's honesty with lies, lies and more lies."
1631,sarc,a double helping of insulting spam? i'm honoured....emoticonxgood how interesting that you selectively belittle crick's comments on panspermia while lauding his debunked tornado in a junkyard conjecture.
1632,sarc,"and what do you think obama's proposal was, death panels? why do you think that he used the ancdote if not to propose that the insurance companies should not be allowed to drop clients in the middle of cancer treatemnt? i kind of wonder what you think the healtcare overhaul is about. 1. the man was dropped. 2. his treatement was delayed. 3. he died. but suppose that obama did lie, and he did not propose that the insurance companies should not be able to drop clients in the middle of cancer treatement. still what is wrong is wrong with that idea?"
1633,sarc,anything that does not predict imminent catastrophe seems to irritate you doesnt it? my point is that eco worrying is not an exact science.
1634,sarc,yeah and i suppose being confronted with reason is a challenge for you too... i mean hey i don't call your marriage a lie or your wife a whore but you can do the same to my significant other? tidings of comfort and joy to you too scrooge...
1635,sarc,"gee, i wonder why the liberal left is so quiet? i remember when bush's dwi from decades previously came out, and you couldn't shut the hypocrites up!  it's hilarious."
1636,sarc,"everyone can see the racism. they did not deny whites their rights, they only denied freed slaves their constitutionally recognized as inalienable and therefore protected rights!  sigma. are you sure you want to continue looking like a rights denier? i am only thinking of you."
1637,sarc,"so you want to try it as a demonstration? i thought not. claims are easy to make but you have produced no evidence but words and only fiction to present.  yep, it is almost there per 100,000. meanwhile, your nation is rising by leaps and bounds and innocent people are being convicted to protect criminals. even dan rather commented on u.k. crime being much worse than any place in america. there is a reason for that...."
1638,sarc,"it's not a fallacy. cars or religion are not basic necessities. having your house put out or your fatal injury treated are, so there is no comparison. he is trying to say that the basic necessities you need in order to live should not be privatized, with the obvious exception of food. corporations can't buy the oxygen in the atmosphere, can they? i don't like the government running things either, but when private corporations are doing a worse job than any government could, its time for the government to step in."
1639,sarc,"not wrong - but your attempt to try to infer that you do not deny jesus christ has now been exposed for the world to see.  not only that, but you're a liberal, aren't you? you claim not to be a conservative, you do not oppose gay marriage, you're pro-choice; you refuse to publicly acknowledge christ as your lord and savior, so that's a flaming liberal to me.  would you like some more kool aid? :p"
1640,sarc,"your daddy plugged your hole?? is that why you are so sour. i guess you ate too many beans recently, and that made you full the holy spirit.."
1641,sarc,"Uhhhh, I just said that I DO JUDGE! So what in the hell are you talking about? You're not well. I didn't bother to adress your points about slavery because there's no point. I disagree with your claims as I suspect would most historians. But it doesn't surprise me that Christians would try to claim that they ended slavery since they also try to falsely claim they founded the country."
1642,sarc,"Wouldn't professing atheism cover that?Or were you looking for something else? I'll call mine ""Bertrand""."
1643,sarc,Not even let white people in? I can imagine why your teacher suggested a reality check.
1644,sarc,"You mean back in 1993 when Clinton had been in office for only 13 months? Do you think George H.W. Bush knew about these bombers before hand and didn't warn Clinton?But, even so, check out this link, if you aren't too damned lazy (I can't cut and paste from that site):snopes.com: Clinton Administration and TerroristsBut phobic little minds are already fixated on what they believe and you probably won't."
1645,sarc,"Calling someone a ""liar"", ""fool hardy"", ""[corrupter] of the truth"", and unobjective is considered complimentary where you come from? Odd, but OK, I'll go with it you lying brainwashed fool (hey, this is fun! I like using Archie's compliments!).Actually, my ""sick hypothetical"" was a very valid question. I simply asked you if god commanded you to kill your neighbour for his sins, sins which you had no evidence of, would you do it. It seems like a fairly simple, straightforward question to me. Why not answer it?I see a pattern here Archie. If someone asks you a tough question about your faith, you cry ""Corrupter! Blasphemer!"" and run away. Is this your idea of ""witnessing""? Is your faith that weak? Answer my simple little question, then I will answer the same one, or another of your choosing if you'd like. Tit for tat."
1646,sarc,Is North Korea a bastion of peace and good-living? Nope. Is it religious? Nope. Therefore obstacles to 'peace' don't necessarily have to be tied in with religiosity.Hope that's spelt out enough for you. Try to keep up.
1647,sarc,You've got no problem with Jim Crow laws? Nice.It IS seperate. Black people are not white people.
1648,sarc,"Hi Archie! How's the fact checking going? Same as usual?Look at Cash's posting history. You should recognize it, it's similar to yours. I even outlined it above for you.Oh, so he didn't insult Pandion in this specific instance, so I was therefore wrong to say that his usual repertoire consists of insulting those who disagree with him? No, I don't think that's the way it works."
1649,sarc,"It bounces off me like bullets off Superman emoticonXClownSeriously, this is your rejoiner? To make fun of my title? lol, how that stings... I think I have to go get a tissue before I reply ;)If you care to try and back up your statements, then we might have a debate."
1650,sarc,But? If? Isn't? But that's?Must be a Progressive prison or something. emoticonXSmilie
1651,sarc,I find it funny you think Article V was repealed yet the bill of rights references Article V for passage. So we have the bill of rights which can't be repealed but Article V which was repealed meaning all the amendments we had are unconstitutional? You've really lost it haven't you.
1652,sarc,"Of course I can't. Can you guarantee that the apparent mugging about to happen isn't some poor slob about to ask directions? Big guy, dark parking lot, bang bang. Better safe than sorry, eh?"
1653,sarc,"Atheism is a religion? Pray tell, where would I find the atheist church?Ridiculous."
1654,sarc,"Evidence? We're talking religion here. Religion. If there were evidence, then it would be science."

1657,sarc,"your ""minds""? How many do you have? Oh, and ""I wanted to see what inferior it was""? Nice example of your supposed superiority."
1658,sarc,...but you are just fine with marijuana smoke huh?I am working on the assumption that you run home to tell mommie or you run to find your teacher and report it immediately. Midgets like you got to have some backup.How and why do you always change the subject? Can't take the heat? Do you ever read headers?You got a mouth on you as big as grand canyon.
1659,sarc,"Because there are good things about every state means....what exactly? Of course there is good in bad in most everything, which has nothing to do with what I said.Yes, great food, crawfish as a staple, great fishing, bayous, New Orleans, Mardi Gras....long beads......sure, some great things. With regards to achievement or vision? I'm not seeing it. Legal gambling? That was another recent ""achievement"". What about wanting to secede from the Union? Yes, Louisiana is the consistent trend-setter for the civilized world. Oh wait, it isn't.-Mach"
1660,sarc,"BOY-HOWDY!! Why don't you let me know how you really feel? I have not tried to demonize anything. Rap music does that to itself without any help from me. Rap is the lowest form of music that I have ever heard. It is just too primative for my tastes. Once again, I am not a racist, nor am I sexist. I do my own washing. I wish you and your child nothing but the best in life. Some folks think that exposing young children to Rap music is a form of child abuse, I agree with those folks.P.S. Tell that Southern girl to find another room-mate, you sound like a horrible role model. Well, got to go wash some more underwear."
1661,sarc,"And you know what I think? I think that everyone who doesn't have sex 24 hours a day 7 days a week is denying human beings life every second. I'm sure some of those sperm would love to have the chance to breathe the air that you are breathing in vain because you don't think they should live [/sarcasm]. Why don't you think this? Why embryos? Embryos are the one thing that have great potential to cause harm in a woman, and you just so happen to choose them as human beings. Very suspicious..."

1666,sarc,"pay attention to what ? to the voices in your head ? your age is irrelevant to your recognized lack of intelligence, but being a minor would be relevant since it would excuse your ignorance.My advice to you ?keep all your life pretending in forums that you are just a kindergarten kid and therefore people would think that for a 4 year old kid you are not too dumb and of course knowing nothing is understandable."
1667,sarc,"...but it's consentual! Why do you and your Victorian sisters keep barging in and spoiling the fun?

1669,sarc,"Whew, and I thought he had speed and spread copyrighted on this forum. Lets see if you can defend those arguments, one at a time. I used to debate in the same way, but I have since learned.Would you like me to use similar tactics? I am prepared to nuke you with speed and spread."
1670,sarc,"No more of a poison than alcohol (actually far less), should we start lacing that with strychnine? ***I can see it now****Excuse me bartender...what are the drink specials?-We got Bud Light bottles for $4.00, Jagerbombs for $7.50, and this new drink called Convulsions on the Beach.

1676,sarc,"Are you suggesting the pollsters are bias? Nooooooooooo, that couldn't be. You think they were trying to sway the election? Noooooooooo, that couldn't be.

1678,sarc,"What the heck did you have for breakfast today, huh? A bowl of nails and terpentine to wash it down? Talk about a foul mood. You've been to half a dozen threads just this morning launching personal attacks at everybody you come across, and most of them have something to do with 'I'm glad there aren't more people in the world like you,' or 'I hope you're the only ones the terrorists kill so we can get back to making this nation great,' blah blah blah. They invented things like Midol for moods like yours.Just because someone doesn't agree with you doesn't make them stupid, or misguided, or immoral, or dishonest, or any of the other snipes you've been firing off. Lol, and you're telling me to not throw any hissy fits."

But I congratulate you for finally admitting that this is a trolls thread. That is more than I expected from you. And as for me reinforcing your contention about conditional christian love ?

1684,sarc,Really? Why don't you go out and start randomly hurting and killing people and see how far that argument gets you in court.
1685,sarc,"Waxy, please read this. Maybe it will help you. When you said the proper way to say it was, ""....tell me I'm wrong, at least do it grammatically."" you made absolutely no sense. Do something grammatically? You obviously have to use grammar when you write a sentence."
1686,sarc,"No more hypocritical than somebody actively harping on me for citing the Huffington Post, but then HAVING NO negative comment for the RNC embracing NewsMax...But here's an idea.You probably wouldn't vote for me cause I cited Huffington Post, right?So logically, one should ALSO NOT VOTE for Republicans who embrace NewsMax, right???emoticonXDonnoNah. I don't expect that kind of consistency..."
1687,sarc,"Now you're just being an butt. The word Dungarees is a coloquialism. Do you know what that word means? Also that's what jeans were called before the word ""jeans' entered the venacular.

1696,sarc,I have an entire New Testament. You've got what - a mouthful of denial? When you get to the level of the NT works let us know.
1697,sarc,"Tell me genius, how is me accurately and correctly pointing out your mistake colluding to misdirect anyone? Either you are again using words you don't know the meaning of to make such an inaccurate statement, or you're just lying. So which is it penfold, are you ignorant or just being dishonest again? emoticonXConfused"
1698,sarc,"So you think it is a good idea for public schools to assume the role of parents? Perhaps you would support a balance then. Given what you say here, you wouldn't think it a bad idea for the New Hampshire School System to take a field trip to the local Catholic church would you? You know, so kids can know what resources, agencies, and organizations are available to them in the event that they may need to interact with them in the future.The School Board apparently gets the message, however. According to the article, it has instructed school administrators to investigate the matter, and determine whether disciplinary action is necessary. I would think it is."
1699,sarc,"Now settle down charlie, and try to think rationally, just for a second. Have you ever heard of a tumor growing into a sentient life form as a fetus does? I'd appreciate a link documenting such an occurrence so we pro-lifers can start planning save the tumor rally's."
1700,sarc,The VPC has a political agenda. The FBI? That is like saying I believe Coke taste better than Pepsi because the Coke commericial says so.

0,notsarc,"So we agree..... What I want to know is why the vocal homosexual 'lobby' insists on the term ""marriage?""   emclean, the sanctity of marriage would not be the only thing about marriage to be (harmed?) changed. The whole definition of marriage would change, too."
1,notsarc,"""The Civil War was fought to establish the principle that each person owns his own body - a principle that the pro-life crowd is trying to destroy.""   Each owns his own body? Are you talking about the woman or the child in the womb?"
2,notsarc,"You know, your comparison of those that fought to end segregation, to those that fight to enact gun ban and gun control laws, is nothing more than a cheap and dirty tactic that does nothing to address the issue, and everything to suggest that breaking the law is alright if you're a politician or legislator.   There's a very large difference between people like Rosa Parks, and the mayor of Philadelphia; gun ownership is protected by the Constitution, segregation wasn't.   The fact that you're comparing those who instituted civil disobedience for good reasons, to those who want to violate state laws to pass their own laws because they think they know better and have a right to do so, just shows that you can't address the point at hand."
3,notsarc,"Actually, selection occurs by differential reproductive rates. What this means is that organisms which reproduce more will have more offspring than the others (obviously). Therefore, traits that help organisms reproduce will become more prevailant."
4,notsarc,"Then should not your challenge be re-worded to say ""What might be the best...""   Because at present we are not at a stage where by we know everything about 'pain' therefore in the current climate, rather than what might be known down the track, I think I have met the majority of your challenge. After-all, you are insisting now on what 'you can measure', and we can't measure all that there is about pain, at present."
5,notsarc,"Well, I don't believe in evolution. I believe in things for which I have no evidence. And while it is true that everyone has bias, using correct science and the process of peer review works to eliminate. Not all is perfect, and people are people, but overall the system works. Not a lot of bad science gets through. In the case of ""creation science"" we know that there is no science involved. Only talk that sounds scientific. There is no hypothesis, prediction or testing. Only ad hoc stories constructed of selected bits of evidence to support the foregone conclusion."
6,notsarc,False. See above.
7,notsarc,According to Gallup about 8% of the U.S. population is atheist. Another poll by CUNY found that 7.7% of those polled responded that they had no religion.
8,notsarc,Good old monkeys! What can't we learn from them   Since we are in the Creation vs Evolution section I'm guessing that your debate here is that monkeys and humans show some similar ways of thinking such as in this experiment. It does seem like further evidence that evolution did take place between our two species although it isn't a case cracker by any means.
9,notsarc,"Technically, all syllogisms need two premises, first of all.   ""Step two"" and ""step three"" were a dilemma, not separate steps. Learn to read.   Dilemma:   You only read Scenario 1, which was:   step two -God can create a rock he cannot lift -   Step three - God cannot lift the rock   conclusion - God is not all powerful   Scenario Two was   - God cannot create such a rock   - Therefore, there is something God cannot do   - Therefore, God is not all-powerful   The only case in which God could truly be all-powerful is if he can somehow both create an unbreakable rock and then break it, which defies the Law of Non Contradiction and is thus absurd. Thus, the notion of all-powerfulness, which leads to such a notion, is also absurd."
10,notsarc,"Sorry, but that's not in the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Try again."
11,notsarc,"Because everyone is equal in the eyes of the law, and rightly so. As for moral standing, you see no problem with equating his immoral behaviour with your own response. Most would."
12,notsarc,"And that's when her career and popularity took a nosedive.   Now that she's no longer playing the activist, she's becoming popular again."
13,notsarc,"A more precise term would be ""broaden,"" since nothing about the definition pertaining to the people currently covered by it would be affected, ""diluted"" or altered in any way anyone has yet demonstrated. Nothing about the definition that pertains to people who already are, or can be married changes one iota. Their rights, benefits, and protections remain exactly the same. The only ""change"" would be to other people, people who have no connection to, nor impact on, the marriages of anyone else: the gays who'll marry if the legal definition is broadened to encompass them. And the only ""change"" in that regard will be the fact that they are encompassed by it, nothing more. No substantive aspect of the definition as it currently stands changes in the slightest.   The change is not in the definition itself. It's in who it applies to."
14,notsarc,"What is your point? Should we revert to old laws that allow for slavery?   Over the history of mankind we have struggled to understand God. God has revealled part of Himself to us, but it is difficult for the limited mind to know the unlimited mind.   The US had laws enabling this? Does this mean you weren't a democracy then?   When you were a child, and had total awe of your parents, and believed what they told you, were you less of a person then?   Surely you understand that what your parents taught you then, was a part of you growining and becoming an adult.   God for instance calls Himself 'Father'. This isn't because He has 'male sex organs' but because it is the best way for us to understand His relationship to us.   Likewise, the Jews made laws in order to best live according to God's Will. They did make mistakes, and got bogged down in the law. Jesus came (as promised by God) and liberated us from the entrapment we had set for ourselves.   Surely you don't advocate that we should return to a strict observence of Mosaic laws?"
15,notsarc,And that didn't have a thing to do with my point.
16,notsarc,"Same thing happened in Rwanda. First they put the names of all Tutsis on lists. Then, the Hutu came around with machettes and took them off of the lists....permanently."
17,notsarc,"Don't you think this would fit the 'Creationism is nothing but lie's thread a bit better? Although I notice The Skeptic making disparaging remarks about your examples, it seems he attacks you more than deal with the well documented   examples you have."
18,notsarc,"Well that may be your contention, but medically that is not necessarily true. Maybe being gay doesn't mean you are suicidal or depressed, but there is more of it going on in the gay life than in the hetero. That in itself is a wake up call. Depression and suicide are harmful, even if it doesn't touch you personally. If it were as simple as you say the APA wouldn't be re-evaluating ""reorientation therapies"" would they and with positive critiques too. You wouldn't have prominent gay activists like Camile Paglia deriding the gay community for being malcontent when those unhappy with being gay seek and desire the way to be hetero."
19,notsarc,"just how i said it...   opinion...   like, what you think   of it"
20,notsarc,"Hmmm... so, barren women can not have a valid point of view nor women in the stage of menopause because it does not affect them personally. Perhaps you should tell the moderator to institute women only Forums, men only Forums, gays only Forums…. etc"
21,notsarc,"Well, the first part is true but I'm not sure I understand what you are saying in the second part. Science does not claim that intelligent design is false because science lacks the tools to examine the concept. ID is just another unsupported assertion outside the domain of science (and logic for that matter). ID has reached the stage of unsupported assertion without evidence. Science has better explanations."
22,notsarc,"Actually, natural selection tends to preserve a species with only minor changes in a stable environment. But environments tend to change. I don't know what that ""incipient organ"" junk is supposed to mean. Is that another way of saying ""what good is half a wing."" Well, check out a penguin to find out. Look at a seal flipper. It has the same bones, arranged in the same way as a monkey. What good is it for a land animal? And what does ""fully functional"" mean? What function? Perhaps the new organ had a different purpose - take the clawed hands of fossil birds for example. They were good for catching prey and climbing, just like they were for their dinosaur ancestors. But those clawed wings also allowed early birds to fly."
23,notsarc,"thatisnt stupid, its what teh bible says. teh dinosaurs are heavier thatn humans so they sunk and humans foated. the arc protecid the rest ans they died later when humans kiled them tehy still see dinos today in congo so some survivd."
24,notsarc,"Actually it wouldn't. Since there is no rational, believable evidence for creationism, it wouldn't be any more believable if evolution were disproved. As an example, I dare you to start a thread in an appropriate forum and give us tested evidence for a global flood as depicted in Genesis. Good luck."
25,notsarc,He is a hell of a lot wiser than thee.
26,notsarc,"It depends on the particular situation. Some adoption agencies ask about it, and some don't. Most social workers who do home studies are aware that they have gay clients doing adoptions. Some adoptive gay parents are out about it, and some keep it quiet.   There are currently some foreign countries that require adoptive single parents to sign an affadavit that says, ""I am not homosexual."" Those are the rules of some foreign countries, notably China, not the United States or any state.   China has recently placed greater restrictions on prospective adoptive parents. They have sharply limited the opportunities for single people to adopt, and it looks like they may prohibit single-parent adoptions entirely. They have also instituted a weight requirement for all adoptive parents. In the case of a couple, their combined weight has to be below a certain figure or they are not allowed to adopt. No fat people allowed to adopt, which cuts out possibly most Americans."
27,notsarc,"Because guns are the best method available on the market. Settling for second best when you could have the best is just stupid.   Better locks? The best they'll do is slow down the person seeking to harm you, their effectiveness is contingent on the strength of the door they're on.   Alarms? So somebody will know that you're in danger, what then? That won't get the police there any faster than dialing 911.   Non-lethal weapons? Somethings non-lethal is a non-option. Brandishing a can of pepper spray won't cause an attacker to flee for their life, it won't hold them at bay until the police arrive to arrest them, it won't stop a violent individual from across the room, and it sure as hell won't affect somebody that's doped up on narcotics.   And stun guns are more useless than knives, because as I've said before, you need to get right up against your attacker to use them. You have to get within stabbing distance to shock them, do you really want that to be your best option for protecting yourself? The idea is to keep the bad guy away from you, not let them get right next to you.   All of these non-lethal devices, they set up the false notion that the life of a criminal intent on hurting or possibly killing you, is worth more than your own life. That belief is stupid and should be done away with. Ask any woman that's ever been raped if they feel that their attacker deserves to live more than they do."
28,notsarc,"Wow. A very unusual and distressing story, and probably why saline abortions are no longer used.   It is very unfortunate for her to have to live with that disability."
29,notsarc,"Since when were proteins no longer structures? A basic freshmen tool for teaching is the phrase ""structure defines function."""
30,notsarc,"The only person who can take away your sin is God. No human can ever cleanse himself of his sins, so get over it."
31,notsarc,Should free speech require registration?
32,notsarc,"That should be, ""duh"".   I knew what you meant. A bit of humor is ok.   But I guess you don't have anything to say about the implications of this study."
33,notsarc,"What is astounding about it? If we had been aborted, we wouldn't have known anything about it. Untold billions of conceptions have been spontaneously aborted. Do you shed tears for those, too?"
34,notsarc,"No I do not say that the creation of energy and matter   did not coincide the creation of the laws that govern/regulate   them. What I say is that the laws are not the RESULTS of the   existence of energy, matter etc."
35,notsarc,The biblical end has got to be near. This was a Doctor who spends all of his life saving people's lives.
36,notsarc,"How do you know none of the ""children"" were actually gang members engaged in illegal activity, and that fact was simply excluded because it wasn't considered newsworthy?"
37,notsarc,"Upon reviewing the golden rule ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you"" I see nothing of any other 'side.' It's very clear--treat others the way you'd want to be treated. No one wants to be treated badly, so if you follow the golden rule, you'll be benevolent."
38,notsarc,"No, I'm saying it's OK because abortion is legal in this country. I was just pointing out that it's also legal to execute a convicted killer, and it's fine and dandy to declare wars where many people will die. ""Thall shalt not kill, unless there is a war"".   Legally there is a difference. But let's just toss that out for a second. The end result is exactly the same. Eyes fogged over no longer care whether it was fun or self defense.   It's only time it's your call, is when it's suicide."

41,notsarc,"So then the law is flawed because criminals could just as easily get their hands on select firearms, ban or no ban. You've just admitted that the bill did nothing and thus there's no justification for it to be reinstated."
42,notsarc,"Since I was there, I'll give you an objective rundown:   1.) Dawkins didn't ""crash"" anything. He watched the movie without saying a word and participated in a Q&amp;A session with the producer at the end --a session that the producer deliberately started.   2.) There was no ""sneaking"" on any level. PZ, his daughter, and I all registered our names over the internet for the event and selected the option to have up to three guests come with us. We registered our real names, our real addresses, our real telephone numbers, and our real emails, and we all received confirmation emails approving our registration.   3.) What possible reason did they have to deny PZ a viewing of the film? Dawkins and I pressed the producer Mathis on this issue, and he said it was about money -- he wanted PZ to come back in a month and pay his $10. But this makes no sense. PZ was paid $1,200 for his interview. They thanked him for the interview in the credits. If money was a concern, they could have paid him $1,190 and given him a free reservation. Just the fact that he was in the film should have been enough to warrant a seat at a pre-screening event.   This all begs the question: What in God's name are they so bloody afraid of?"
43,notsarc,"To clarify: is it the womans choice whether the guy is prosecuted after he has been named, or is it the states? By what you've said so far, it seems that all this law does is give woman the power to punish men if they get pregnant by them; despite the fact that the woman was just as consenting as the man at the time of the coitus.   There are also contraceptive paths for women that don't involve condoms. If a woman gets pregnant because she forgot to take the pill that morning and always relied on that rather than on condoms to stop her getting pregnant, why should the man be punished?   The message here should be simple. If you don't want an abortion, and aren't currently in a position where you can support your children, don't have unprotected sex. At the moment, it is the woman's choice alone whether she has an abortion or not, so it is the woman who has to look after the child if she is single after its birth. If you want to add men to that equation, you have to add them in both places - give them the legal right to 'have an abortion' (force their partner to have one), and make them legally responsible for the child if they do not do so. Then you have an entirely connected couple from coitus onwards; both consenting to sex, both choosing not to have an abortion and both caring for the child after birth. I doubt that that law would be a popular one, either - but if you are going to force a man to take equal legal responsibility for a child, you have to give them equal legal opportunity to avoid it."
44,notsarc,From your own link it is very clear the NRA DID NOT say that or publish that. Your clearly very wrong.
45,notsarc,"Oh. You just lost me. The fact is, Jesus warned his followers that they would be persecuted for his sake. Read Matthew 10:5-42, if you care for the full text. Basically he told them they would be beaten, thrown in prison, crucified, and put to death if they followed him. And that is exactly what happened to the disciples and all those who gave a witness for Christ as Lord and Savior.   The various Roman emperors in those years of the early church sought to kill every Christian they could find, men, women, and children. Christians were crucified by the thousands, covered in pitch, and sit afire to provide light for the emporer's lavish garden parties. They were killed in the arena by wild animals and tortured to death in numerous ways. They were called martyrs, which now means one who dies for a cause. The word is Greek and means “witness”. These witnesses for Christ were killed for their faith. How many Christians would we have today if they had to die for their faith? In spite of everything that the emperor did, they could not kill the Christians fast enough. More were believing in Christ every day, and eventually even the Roman emperor himself became a Christian and Christianity was embraced and sanctioned."
46,notsarc,"And it's only wishful thinking that they haven't. You are in no better position than I am. You don't know anymore than I do. Science has admitted that antarctica was much warmer several thousand years ago...not only that but the following map shows that the continent was not frozen. And if it was not frozen several hundreds years ago....and it was not frozen 4-5,000 years ago, as it was stated on this next seal link, then it's pretty safe to say that animals and humans could have both been there in recent history (within a few thousand years.) I agree this is no proof that it was attached, however, it is proof that the weather/temperature was DRASTICALLY different on antarctica than science has admitted.....and there's got to be a reason for this drastic change in temperatures.   http://www.world-mysteries.com/sar_1.htm   http://news.nationalgeographic.com/n...ent-seals.html   In an Antarctic ""ghost town,"" freeze-dried whiskers, skin, and bones provide evidence that the South Pole was a much warmer place not too long ago, a new study reveals.   ""We thought, This is really strange. If they are elephant seals, what are they doing here?"" Hall said.   The discovery, scientists say, is the first hard evidence for a warming period in the region between 2,300 and 1,100 years ago.   An earlier warming period, between 6,000 and 4,000 years ago, has been recognized by other researchers and is believed to have been widespread, at least throughout the Southern Hemisphere. (so widespread that there wasn't snow on the ground and it wasn't frozen over!)"

50,notsarc,And you think this a good thing? It just shows the weak cowardly position of the creationist.
51,notsarc,"No I don't . I want children (at least my children and family) to be placed in a school where they do not have to worry about one of their classmates pulling out a tech 9 and going on a rampage in the library. I don't think that is too much to ask. I think eliminating the risk of this makes a school a much more effective place to learn. How many people do you think actually learned anything at Columbine the day they came back to school, or perhaps were they a little distracted. I'm all for the government giving you and like-minded extremists your own school (hell, even your own state...why not) and letting you all carry guns into schools and every other place you want to. As long as when a gunfight breaks out at your school in Rottencrotch Nebraska, I don't have to see all the parents on TV crying and bawling about how could this tragedy happen here, and saying that something should have been done, this never should have happened. I think there is a time and place for guns, but I don't think that guns belong in schools."

67,notsarc,"But it took a lot longer to develop. My point was that only after about 5000 years of human civilization did empiricism as science develop. Religion, supernaturalism, and mythology trace back into prehistory. What we know as science didn't even begin to exist until the late 1500s and 1600s. Before that it was OK to do science like Aristotle did - no experiment, only thinking about a logical answer. Thus, heavy objects fell faster than light ones and any fool could tell that the sun orbited the earth.   But science is more than an inner way of thinking. It is a process and a method for learning about the universe. It is called methodological naturalism. That is not to say the science asserts that nothing exists except what is natural. It says that science can't study the supernatural."

74,notsarc,"Well ... I don't think it's a light choice for anyone. (Although I'd imagine, for someone who might be developmentally disabled, for example, it might not mean as much. And I suppose some may not care at all.) I don't think it's a decision women necessarily struggle over, either, however. Nor should they. For many women, the course of action that they need to take is quite clear.   That is, whether or not someone 'should' have a difficult time with this decision, I don't agree. And, I don't think women's motivations in getting abortions, or their personal behavior ITO becoming pregnant are anyone else's concern. Or even if they do have an abortion *blithely*. (Distinguishing from policies about public health education.)   I just think people have to do what's right for them. Finding that or reaching a decision -- well, people are different and have different lives. They have different understandings of biology, different health issues, different relationships, different economic positions, different religious views, or none at all. The circumstances around the pregnancy, different.   I don't agree with the ""potentiality"" issue either. If *someone* isn't there *yet*, they're not in existence, period. I think there's just an understandable human reaction to the beginning of life being taken. It's not ""potential"" life. It's life all right. But there's no individual except in our imaginations.   To me, viability, sentience, the development of the nervous system and the brain, and the experience of pain in a fetus during the third trimester begin to mark the ethical boundaries. But those, too, as indicators, are not absolute. And the woman comes first. It's between her and her physician. It's not my job to judge whether she suffered appropriately enough or not. And I don't think anyone should have go through any demonstrative motions one way or the other for the anti-abortion camp. It's none of their business."

76,notsarc,"So you're admitting openly that what is a normal occurrence within the human species is offensive to you. That you find repulsive the very intimacy expressed by your own parents that led to your own existence. Do you see how that innate bitterness against the normal and right feelings that have led to the healthy continuation of the human race is ultimately anti-humanity? Why do you hate the normal propagation of our species Matt? Can't you see that if you were given the power to recreate the world in your image, then the world would cease to exist within one generation? No matter how pro-gay you are, how can you be so anti life in good conscience?"
77,notsarc,"Actually, qualified biologists know no such thing. In fact, I've never known one who would agree with that assertion. Can you give us some peer reviewed references to support your assertion?"

85,notsarc,"If that's truly what the organization says, then it's a hypocrite of an organization."
86,notsarc,Certainly it does.
87,notsarc,"Yes, that's all true, and it makes complete sense. But in doing this, the Court may have created a situation where plaintiffs can argue that California is denying people the equal protection of the laws, by allowing some people to be married to same-sex spouses and not allowing other people to be so married. If that is the argument that the plaintiffs make in their federal lawsuit, this could be interesting. The courts might have to interpret whether allowing some people to be married and not allowing other people to be married violates the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to the U.S. constitution. And then they might have to decide whether this means that all same-sex couples must have the right to marry, because some of them can be legally married. In other words, this situation may be an opportunity, because no one can argue that this is a case of apples and oranges of same-sex couples being different from opposite-sex couples. Now you have same-sex couples who are legally married and same-sex couples who cannot be legally married in the same state, which can be argued to be denial of equal protection of the laws. I don't know....it could be interesting. Maybe things won't play out this way. We'll have to wait and see."
88,notsarc,So then women who are pregnant shouldn't be allowed to   1) Smoke   2) Take any kind of drug that could possibly harm the child   3) Drink   or do any otherwise legal action?   And VOR takes another giant step towards fascism.
89,notsarc,"No, actually they used the Bible as a basis for their morality. They then applied that morality to the design of a system of government that they wanted to create.

94,notsarc,"How is that silly? You do realize that the vast majority of firearms used in crimes are stolen no? And many of those are stolen from legal buyers.

95,notsarc,"So sorry, Anastasia...that's a horrible thing to face. And now, using that excuse? What!   If justice was swift for the guilty then he would not have escaped only to do it again.

But, I am glad you didn't let it (revenge) effect you to the point of taking his life yourself.   If it would have been my father, those many years ago, I cannot say that I would have waited, nor would have accepted that lame excuse of retardation. I could very well be in prison myself."
96,notsarc,I believe studies have already been done on that subject.
97,notsarc,"You are distorting my view. I certainly do not think that I am ""god"" or that everyone has to revolve around my standard. However, I do think that morality has to have a rational basis behind it. This is my particular rational basis.   My moral code certainly isn't my own invention but is based on the moral codes which I have often heard expressed by others, as well as the moral code of the German philosopher Kant (often referenced in secular moral discussions). Most people from childhood are taught morals at least partly from the same points of view I use. After all, how often have you heard the phrase ""How would YOU like it if that happenned to you?"" or something similar. That is essentially the same as my basis of morality. It seems to be very common. Even many religions use a similar basic appoach - ""Do unto others..."". Of course, we all differ enough in our psychology that we might have some differences in how we would expect to be treated by others. So, this approach that I present would not lead to the same result in all people. Also, this approach depends on the capabilities of the person to see the big picture and to be able to fully see things from the other person's point of view. Since we are imperfect in these skills, it certainly helps to have moral discussions, moral mentors, etc. who can enlighten us in various situations. It is not a perfect method but at least it is not arbitrary since it is based on reason. Note that the famous German philosopher Kant gave a similar secular moral code in his Categorical Imperative: ""Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law"".   Your view doesn't seem to be based on reason but on a blind trust in a religious authority that tells you that a particular set of rules is right and must not be questioned. For those of us who do not hold the same beliefs as you, those rules often seem quite arbitrary. Sometimes some of the reasons behind those rules are illucidated, often not. Sometimes the rules are the same as those derived by secular reasoning, sometimes not.   Personally, I would prefer an imperfect moral code that at least is based on reason and is refineable to one that is immovable and based on arbitrary standards.   On a last note, there certainly could be moral codes that are based neither on religion nor on some version of the moral code which I have presented. If so, I would be quite interested in hearing them."
98,notsarc,"And many of those countries are having problems with it. Furthermore, we aren't even proposing what other countries have."
99,notsarc,"Well, the slavery analogy for gay rights is past it's applicability at this point--one was a property issue (also rooted in deep prejudice), the other is a morality issue. Many people oppose gay marriage out of morality and NOT prejudice. The same can't be said for slavery. There are many ways that the analogy doesn't work and that's just one of them. In fact, it could as easily be an analogy to reverse it and say that the ones who did the enslaving were analogous to gay rights lobbyists and the abolitionists were analogous to those who seek to protect marriage. After all, the plantation owners were the ones really fighting for ill-conceived rights--rights that they shouldn't have had."

102,notsarc,On what grounds do you seek to redefine the institution of marriage from it's accepted standard in this country?
103,notsarc,"(Note the key word ""also,"" which admits that it's human).   As for the rest, This is more of the sort of ""defensive rationalization"" I talked about earlier, i.e. when people find it more rewarding to self-righteously defend their wrongdoings and thus shirk their responsibility to others, than to shoulder the burdens to those they have harmed, and thus they act in self-absorbed narcissism and sociopathic dissociation, while likewise waxing arrogant in self-deceiving affirmation of their own ""brilliance"" and other superiority to do as they please, by simply denying said consequences however obvious-- illustrated here, by simply calling a fetus a ""parasite"" and thus daintily strutting off away from one's obvious duties to it, despite admitting it's also human.   However, a human being forced into dependency on another for its life, is not a ""parasite,"" but a VICTIM, and thus has the right to aid from the ones responsible for that dependency.   Since you've admitted that it's human, then the remainder is plain; it also has the right to aid from the one responsible for its dependency, i.e. the man and woman in question who proximately caused it to be in its dependent situation through their willful actions in full knowledge of that risk.   Here, the doctrine of Strict Liability would apply, in that normal sexual contact carries the inherent risk of pregnancy.   This doctrine already applies to men, and should likewise apply to women who choose to abort in spite of their responsibility to the prenatal human in question, created and made dependent on her for its life through her intentional actions."

115,notsarc,"Actually just as many atheist help the needy.   Of course a person would need to be open-minded to realize it. Here is one such atheist charity. If you were open-minded about such things then you would have learned that both Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, who have each individually made the two largest charitable donations in American history, are both atheist (Oops, bet that's gotta kill your argument, huh?) and they can rightly claim credit for spurring many other ultra-rich to also be charitable.   Ted Turner, the multi-billionaire, has also donated millions to others, and guess what grizzly6626, he's an atheist too!   George Soros, also a multi-billionaire, financier and philanthropist, has also donated millions and is also an atheist. The list goes on and on. You just don't hear about these people donating because they tend to do these things quietly, and not with a lot of *cough* religious *cough* fanfare.   Didn't mean to wake you up grizzly6626   BTW - many catholic charities are known to turn the needy away. I've heard many accounts about how when some people first got married back in the 1970s, that catholic charities wouldn't help them out because they were not ""good, church-going catholics."" Basically because they didn't go to church every week (and put in their money filled envelope) the Church didn't consider them worthy of help.   You see, it isn't because religion makes people morally better than atheism. Rather, it would be because churches often organize charitable activities and encourage their members to participate, while atheists, simply have no comparable social structure. It's not that churchgoers have a superior moral sentiment, just that because of their increased social structure they naturally have increased opportunity.   There are countless amounts of people who are atheist that donate from the heart. They do not 'band together' into groups like religions do, and they do not advertise their charitable works like religions do, but they donate from the heart just the same. Here is a partial list of many such individuals who just happen to also be atheist. But it goes MUCH further than that though. There are a few organizations formed by atheists for the sole purpose of donating to those in need. One such organization is called S.H.A.R.E. - Secular Humanist Aid and Relief Effort. Here is a recent story about them helping those in need. So, when someone ignorant and closed-minded like grizzly6626 tries to convince you that 'only religions' donate or help those in need, you will now know that it's simply not true, and that people from all beliefs, even those that don't believe in God, help others in need and donate from their hearts, because they know it's the right thing to do for their fellow man in need"
116,notsarc,"Pregnancy is always harmful to the woman's body. However, if the pregnancy is desired then the changes are welcomed by the woman.   To a woman who does not want to be pregnant then those changes are very unwelcome and are a bad thing. Pregnancy is always harmful, but the perception of what is happening changes depending on the woman.   You do not understand that whether or not pregnancy harms the woman's body is objective, but whether or not the woman wants the pregnancy anyway depends on the woman. You are mixing the two."

But that's just not true. In the Dover case the court concluded that ID isn't science any more than creationism is. In fact, it was clearly demonstrated that the motivation for ID is an effort to disguise the fact that it is nothing more than creationism without the mention of god. Basically, if you scratch an IDer, you get a creationist."
122,notsarc,"So there's no need to be outraged or question a candidate further just on the basis that he represents the lesser-of-two-evils to you? You're using the fact Palin is there to avoid needing to take Biden to task for HIS statements. If, hypothetically speaking, Palin wasn't there at all and Biden had made the statement alone in a stump speech, you would just leave it at that and not take him to task for his position???   Frankly, if he's the candidate you feel best supports gay rights, I would think this statement on his part would be MORE alarming, and all the MORE cause for concern.   So Biden was against gay marriage there too?   If he's against your right to marriage, knowing why might very well give insight into whether he would change on it at some point or actually be anti-gay in OTHER ways too! Frankly, I find this idea of not probing further to at least try to get some insight into motivations on issues to be pretty odd, let alone not criticizing someone for an anti-gay view just because the other candidate is more anti-gay."

124,notsarc,"Proof that evolution is ""right"" is not necessary to prove that Genesis is not science. Genesis is an inspired poem, and contains truth in its message, but it is pretty obviously a work of poetry, like a song. Look at the repetition, and all the metaphors! Poetry does not imply fiction. THere are many historically valid poems. Plus, when read figuratively, Genesis poses no conflict at all with science.   Evolution is not the only science that demonstrates Genesis can not be read literally. What about the speed of light from the stars, geology, genetics, comparative embryology, etc. The only stumbling block between science and faith is a strictly literal interpretation. For most of us Faith and science work together!   see: songofgenesis.org for more detailed information."
125,notsarc,Whether a fetus is a person is not something open to consideration. An apple is not an orange. The reason that we have two words to apply as labels is simply because they absolutely are not the same thing. It is that simple.   Suppose that a fetus is frozen and implanted in a female 22 years later. Is it of legal drinking age at birth? Obviously not. We currently have the technology to actually do this.
126,notsarc,"No. You're missing the point. Al wants you to think all we have to do is stop emitting CO2. He wants you to fear something that he knows how to fix...so you'll give him prizes for being a genius and solving the problem.   Al Gore is a shyster...just like Michael Moore. Documentary, my XXX!   Tell me, what has caused the global warming on Mars?...Jupiter? I understand the temperatures there have been rising more in the past few years than before. Think it could be resulting from their industrial age?   ...and he's pretty much a hypocrit about what we should do. Check the stats on his personal home. Check the emissions rating of his antique private jet. He claims to be doing his part by leading a carbon neutral life...which means he merely paid for permission to continue polluting the earth with his inefficient means of private transportation and his energy sucking home.   He claims that sea levels will rise 20 feet or so shortly, yet he bought a million dollar condo near sea level in California.   We should all decrease what we spew into the air (and what we send to landfills).

The film claims that melting snows on Mount Kilimanjaro evidence global warming. The Government's expert was forced to concede that this is not correct.   2.	The film suggests that evidence from ice cores proves that rising CO2 causes temperature increases over 650,000 years. The Court found that the film was misleading: over that period the rises in CO2 lagged behind the temperature rises by 800-2000 years.   3.	The film uses emotive images of Hurricane Katrina and suggests that this has been caused by global warming. The Government's expert had to accept that it was “not possible” to attribute one-off events to global warming.   4.	The film shows the drying up of Lake Chad and claims that this was caused by global warming. The Government's expert had to accept that this was not the case.   5.	The film claims that a study showed that polar bears had drowned due to disappearing arctic ice. It turned out that Mr. Gore had misread the study: in fact four polar bears drowned and this was because of a particularly violent storm.   6.	The film threatens that global warming could stop the Gulf Stream throwing Europe into an ice age: the Claimant's evidence was that this was a scientific impossibility.   7.	The film blames global warming for species losses including coral reef bleaching. The Government could not find any evidence to support this claim.   8.	The film suggests that the Greenland ice covering could melt causing sea levels to rise dangerously. The evidence is that Greenland will not melt for millennia.   9.	The film suggests that the Antarctic ice covering is melting, the evidence was that it is in fact increasing.   10.	The film suggests that sea levels could rise by 7m causing the displacement of millions of people. In fact the evidence is that sea levels are expected to rise by about 40cm over the next hundred years and that there is no such threat of massive migration.   11.	The film claims that rising sea levels has caused the evacuation of certain Pacific islands to New Zealand. The Government are unable to substantiate this and the Court observed that this appears to be a false claim.

130,notsarc,"Originally Posted by Symbiote   a) In medicine, the use of antibiotics, the understanding of what causes resistance, and what kind of treatments can be used to avoid resistance. The knowledge that virii (like the bird flu) can easily evolve over time to spread through different organisms, resulting in preventative measures to prevent deadly diseases effecting humans.   ender Krum:   This seems to be micro, not macro, evolution. I am still having trouble combining micro and macro evolution. Could someone address the following statement from wikipedia on micro-evolution?   ""Typically, observable instances of evolution are examples of microevolution; for example, bacterial strains that have become resistant to antibiotics. Because microevolution can be observed directly, both pro-evolution and some anti-evolution groups agree that it is a fact of life.""   Walking-fish:   The mechanisms of mutation, gene flow, genetic drift and natural selection that work for microevolution below the species level, also work at the macroevolutionary level (why wouldn't they?). However, some biologists put more emphasis on the role of mutations of developmental genes at the macro level to push the changes that lead to higher taxons. The most often quoted example here is that of Stephen J Gould, who proposed that the jaws evolved in fish as a result of such genes causing a shift in the position of the first 2 gill arches relative to the others so they could be free to evolve as jaws. I think that these drastic genetic changes would be the only discernable difference in the mechanisms between micro &amp; macroevolution.   As for the ""typically observable"" examples of evolution, I'd like to add that observed speciation events cross the threshold between micro &amp; macro. Also, lineages in the fossil record are easily observable. Genetic markers are, likewise, observable evidence of macroevolution. So it is perfectly legit to say that we can indirectly observe macroevolution by way of this kind of evidence."

132,notsarc,"Well since posting on this thread has died and this seems to me to be the most interesting atheistic theory, I want to get a bit of clarification.   First, what do you mean by being allowed to cease providing for it at any age, but never allowed to kill it? By this do you mean that to cease providing for during the first trimester is not killing it? Is that because it is not alive at that time?   If I follow you (and I'm not sure I do) should the mother be allowed to have the baby removed at some point during the third trimester, after which it must be kept alive (and perhaps put up for adoption)?"

What I haven't seen, either from you or from any of the articles, was what the firefighter's answer was or why he refused to answer.

But rather than accept that fact, evolutionists argue that creationists are ignorant of a subject when, in reality, they (creationists) were simply telling lies."
142,notsarc,Don't expect your misrepresentations of the findings of those studies to sink in. I'm not that easily fooled.
143,notsarc,"believing that god doesnt exist or acknowledging the fact that evidence to support the existence of god has never been found does not equate to science being anti-religious or that science hates religion. in fact, the one thing that both science and religion have in common is acknowledging that belief in god is not based on observable evidence, but rather an individual choice to apply faith in something which cannot be seen or proven. on the one hand, religion continually reaches that in order to believe in god, you must have faith that god is real despite a marked lack of evidence for god's existence. science concludes the same thing: that people who believe in the existence of god do so solely by faith, despite the lack of observable evidence to back this belief   the bottom line is that science does not make religion obsolete by reiterating the fact that there is no evidence for god. religious people also already knows this, and believe in god regardless"
144,notsarc,"First, I think you may have misunderstood the ""pro-life mantra"" seeing how many pro-lifers think it permissable to disconnect life-support systems in certain circumstances, which necessarily results in a person's death. But nevertheless, I think we agree that for purposes of the abortion discussion, it is a closer analogy to assume the violinst is only connected for nine months, and no longer than if we assume the violinist to be connected for some other arbitrary period of time. Am I correctly discerning an agreement on that?"
145,notsarc,"Why would that even be expected? When you consider that it is important to maintain some sort of consistency in study populations, obvious mutants are excluded from the breeding stock. And yet, there are frequent observed mutations. In fact, my elder son once observed two mutations in a single fly in one of his populations. One fly had no wings and white eyes."
146,notsarc,"What do you mean by this?

Also, what would you say to the response that our current law provides that juveniles are sufficiently developed enough to have the responsibility, without parental involvement, to decide whether to obtain an abortion? Is it not a conflict to say juveniles should not be eligible for the death penalty because they are not morally developed enough, but at the same time say juveniles are morally developed enough to decide whether to obtain an abortion without involving their parents?"

155,notsarc,Well I'm glad its no problem for your son. No child deserves to be harrassed.
156,notsarc,"Catholics have a different belief. The goal is to always save both mother and child. If the fetus dies during the attempt to save both, then that's what happens. For instance, with an ectopic pregnancy, the goal isn't to kill he fetus, the goal is to save both mother and fetus."
157,notsarc,I see I jumped the gun. That was well stated.

159,notsarc,"No. We don't agree. For one thing your faith isn't a theory. Creation as described in Genesis is a myth, in fact, two myths. Furthermore, a scientific theory doesn't mean ""wild guess with no foundation"". That seems to be what you want the word to mean. In science a theory is an explanation for observed facts that has been tested. You see, a theory is predictive. I'll give you some examples of scientific theories. The germ theory of disease, the theory of gravitation, the heliocentric theory, tectonic theory, atomic theory.   Moreover, you are wrong that science cannot observe actual evolution of life. It is done all the time. While it may be debatable that a virus is alive, the recent case of SARS making the jump from civets to humans after a mutation is evolution."
160,notsarc,"He was using it as an example. He was saying that if something in your life causes you to sin, get rid of it!   BTW, thanx for giving me the references to your verses! It is really annoying to have to search through the Bible to find verses that people quote without references."
161,notsarc,So what? I don't care! Gun ownership is an individual right and that's the end of it! You don't have to exercise a right hundreds of thousands of times a year for it to be protected by the Constitution.
162,notsarc,"Following the original purpose of this thread, I will summarize my own views on abortion. (Note, this is copied from an older survey on abortion beliefs - a thread in the abortion forum called ""Survey of views on abortion""):   For me, the question of abortion rights comes down to a balance between the rights of the mother and the rights of the fetus. On the side of the rights of the mother, there is a very important right to the control over one's own body and to not be forced to carry something as important and taxing as a pregnancy against one's will. Some may say that, in agreeing to have sex, a woman is agreeing to a pregnancy, but I strongly disagree. A pregnancy is a possible outcome of sex but only has a very small percentage chance if birth control is used. It would be like saying that you agree to be mugged if you walk in a bad neighborhood. The great majority of sex acts - for both married and unmarried women, religious or non-religious, conservative or liberal - are not done for the purposes of having children but are done for emotional and/or purely physical reasons. Pregnancy is the goal for only a minority of sex acts. So, women are not agreeing to a pregnancy when they have sex. In the case of unwanted pregnancies, it is a significant burden that they never agreed to. If they are forced to carry such a pregnancy, it would be a strong imposition against the rights over their own bodies.   On the other hand, one has the rights of the fetus. What rights the fetus has depends on your belief system and priorities. For me, the most important thing when it comes to the rights of any human being is whether or not there is a mental existence - at least a rudimentary mind. I believe that I did not exist until I started to mentally exist and that applies to all others. My view is that, once a mental existence begins, the right to life of a fetus kicks in and takes priority over the mother's rights over her own body, under most circumstances. The neurological view is that a mind cannot exist before the third trimester. Therefore, I would allow abortion-on-demand for the first and second trimester and restrict it in the third trimester. For that third trimester, I would limit abortions to those that are done to mitigate a significant risk to the mother's life or physical or mental health (ex. leading to, say, paralysis or strong possibility of suicide, etc.) and, in case of severe incurable deformations of the fetus discovered late, to end the life of a fetus that would otherwise strongly suffer (i.e. mercy killing). Otherwise, I believe abortions should be restricted. If a woman has not decided on an abortion by the third trimester, she should have to carry the pregnancy to term (minus the perviously mentioned exceptions). She would have had ample time to decide.   Lastly, here are a couple of links which describe the neurological view of a mind not existing before the third trimester:   Part 4 of http://www.2think.org/abortion.shtml   http://7e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=21&amp;id=162"
163,notsarc,"This past Saturday, my partner and I had a commitment ceremony or wedding if you say care to say.....In my state it is not legally bindingm we did it anyway.....it was more about the emotional commitment two people make to each other in the presence of their friends and family.

I was too moved by the moment and all I could do was cry....   I love my partner with all my heart....So I wanted to get through, I thought about our taxes (didn't work).

167,notsarc,"Clearly this is true. There are a multitude of denominations from every religion. This is as specially true with Christianity because the texts do not explain how all the ceremonies are done. Baptism was performed in areas where full immersion could not have occurred but the best explanations of baptism paint a picture of a full immersion. The Church of Christ believes one must baptize in the name of Jesus, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost thing was while Jesus lived. Because the practice of speaking in tongues was used by the first church, some believe the art must stay in the church.   Most of the complications to Christianity is simply because the followers really believed Jesus would return. No one wrote a book on the Religion.   The Religion changed a great deal through time. King James was no saint and he had clear reasons he would not allow some letters into an authorized version he would sign on to.   One letter spoke of the sin of Slavery. This was clearly at odds with King James. Other items would have direct negative effects on the kingdom and I'll let others find the reasoning behind the withdraws."
168,notsarc,"Actually, I think Kronos is right in this case--at least from the standpoint of most consitutional scholars. Of course the framers didn't envision the wording to be used in this way for this purpose--this is what's simply called a ""loophole"", in this case anyway. It's why there has been an effort in recent years to close the loophole with a constitutional amendment defining marriage."
169,notsarc,"First of all rape is one of the most under-reported crimes so it makes sense that abortion due to rape/incest is also under-reported so that makes your assumptions and numbers off.But of course you are missing the whole point.You are not the one being raped so it isn't YOUR choice.I don't need you making choices for me or telling me what is and isn't good for my emotional health.If one gets raped and DOES NOT want to be pregnant who are you tell them they have to be? Abortion should be legal for everybody who wants one not just rape/incest victims,for the simple reason that no human being has the right to substain life by using the body of another why should a fetus have more rights than actual persons?"

""You're not telling people about God, you're guilting them and putting them down. You're drawing an imaginary line that separates ""us"" from ""them"", and you're cutting yourself off from other people. When Jesus ""evangelized"" (I believe with all my heart he would hate that word), he made honest friends, not with the purpose to ""convert"" them. He didn't hand them a track and scare them into being a Christian. No wonder people hate Christians, for God's sake I'm starting to hate Christians.""

181,notsarc,"yes, on the grounds of ""mostly likely"" we can make reasonable assumptions. but we must still treat them as such.   part of the catch of God's existence is that no evidence of his existence cn ever be found. if Jesus actually physically performed observable miracles, even 2000 years ago, then it would surely proven that the supernatural can and does (or did) exist in reality. however, even jesus's ministry contradicts the faith theory. how can God expect faith from those who haven't observed on the grounds of those who have? if people can observe the manifested power of God in reality, then they have physical evidence that God exists. but this conflicts with the nature of God from a biblical standpoint. in other words, the bible cannot claim that physical evidence for the existence of God can exist, and then that it cannot exist, without contradicting itself. what we end up with is the predicament that ANY physical evidence that could possibly support God's existence is evidence against God's existence (at least from a biblical standpoint)"
182,notsarc,"Yes. I believe it's a matter of personal individual freedom.   If purchased legally, and not used to commit a crime, what harm comes from handgun ownership? I don't own one, but I own many other guns. If they can ban handguns, what's to stop them from banning shotguns, or even BB guns?   I don't believe in a nanny state, taking away my toys ""for my own good"".   Waxy"
183,notsarc,But you are smart enough to realize that the ban on gay marriage has nothing to do with it.
184,notsarc,"Well, not completely, but yes, quite the same. However, this is irrelivent- she wasn't a person, because she was in a coma. Does that give me the right to kill her? Of course not!   What about fetuses born in comas? Can we kill them?   What about people in vegetative states? After all, they arn't perfect, so let's kill them!"
185,notsarc,"To me, part of the point of the ""please, no scripture"" comment would be to forgo any insistence that we worship God just because the bible says to.   A person could insist that sons pay some form of homage / respect to their father on Father's Fay, but I would argue that it's not reasonable to do so in every case. For example, if the father was physically or sexually abusive, or the father abandoned his children, those would be reasons to fore-go any Father's Day formalities.   And ""God"" could be viewed as the absent father. Suppose we assume that he created the earth and life on the earth. What's his involvement been since then?   Should we worship him just because he's God?   Or, depending upon how one sees God, is God a being unworthy of worship and idolization?   And along those lines, utilizing the Bible as a reference could be a double-edged sword. The ""God"" of the Old Testament ordered slavery, misogyny, genocide, women as spoils of war, ..."
186,notsarc,"Even new Justice Sotomayor, who claimed she ruled by precedent will be bound by the Heller Decision if she remains true to her purported philosophy. The debate between Sui Juris and Res Judicia should no longer be an issue with the liberals on this RIGHT! It either applies to all or it applies to none which would result as Justice W.O. Douglas wrote: ""a revolution"". It is in the government's (federal especially) best interests to keep our soldiers employed in foreign countries. BTW, I think the court decision in Nunn vs. State of Georgia did the best summation of this right!"
187,notsarc,You think open carrying of loaded handguns in public will become fashionable in CA?   I think if anyone took to this they'd find themselves asked to leave establishments routinely.
188,notsarc,And what does Marc do?   Try to change the subject.
189,notsarc,"The Brady Campaign whines more than they act. Making handguns legal in Chicago wouldn't make them happy. Sending the national guard in wouldn't make them happy. They don't have a solution for the problem, but they're right there to whine about it.   They're just like the Federal Government; they find something simple and complicate it."
190,notsarc,"Oh, I LOVE semantics games"
191,notsarc,But the military is pretty much all a volunteer thing. It's not a hiring process--employer/employee thing. That arrangement lends itself more to the soldier not volunteering for service in the first place.
192,notsarc,"When will it stop? Never. They will take every gun, every toy gun, disarm the law enforcment community, give us Nerf batons so we don't actually hurt the criminals, and say that this kinder gentler way of doing things will help. In the meantime murders will go through the roof, like in Australia, rape will escalate, breaking and entering will become common place, and cops will die by the minute. They will not only confiscate the guns, but then charge the owners of those guns for being terrorists. It won't end. In order to establish true dependency upon a government you must force the populous to rely completely on the government for every aspect of life including safety."
193,notsarc,"Be wary of names. 'junk' DNA is not rubbish ... it's called 'junk' because we don't know entirely what it is used for... But just look at all the blank spaces on this post. They are nothing, but they are keeping the words in order.   Evolutionaries are putting too much faith in names of words - such as human embryonic 'gill slits'   or   'transitional' fossil"
194,notsarc,First of all not all Astronomers believe that.   All though it is a very long way to the closest star we really don't know how far stars are away from us it is not possible to know. It is an educated guess at best.   If you base your beliefs on science you will almost always have to change them so are they really beliefs?   Time and distance are 2 different entities. On the other side of the world it is a diffferent day.   A light year is the distance light would travel in a year if at the speed we have computed it to be on earth. How gravity affects light in space in pure specualtion as almost all of the cosmological theories are. Black holes were created to explain the big bang. There are lots of astonomers that are convinced the big bang is a myth.   If the stars were created near the earth and then streched out as the Bible says they were the relationship of time and distance would be quite different and would explain how light from a distant star could be seen.   No one really knows the answer so it is a matter of faith what you decide is true.   Both are possible according to science. The powers that be in science are atheist and get the most press. This does not make them right by default.   There is a very good book on this subject Starlight and Time if you are interested in what a brilliant scientist who believes in Creation has to say.   I will be suprised if you are.   I have read Hawkings and have him on audio and video.   To be fair you should take some time and study the opposing view IMO.
195,notsarc,So you're actually claiming that it is a lie to say that the UK has a lower gun crime rate than the US? Even if the police were miscounting crimes it's still a huge and unjustified leap in logic to conclude from that that the UK does not have a lower gun crime rate.
196,notsarc,"If logic was invented by man that would mean that when people did not exist neither did logic. That does not sound logical to me. Most people believe there is life eleswhere in the universe (I'm not saying I do but I just want to illustrate a point). If logic was invented by man does that mean aliens elsewhere in the universe do not have logic to guide them?   Just a question.   ""In Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge."" (Colossians 2:3)"
197,notsarc,And folks that refuse to see the legitimate ones put us all at risk. Touche.
198,notsarc,"Well, all I can say then is that no action is just about as bad as failed action, and IS as bad in terms of anything current. Either way you don't have gay marriage. You have a majority in Congress right now, and you're not demanding much change just because of fear of backlash? Yeah, there would be backlash. Heck, the Civil War was the ultimate backlash, but that didn't stop abolitionists from demanding more than TOKEN change, and it's a good thing they did. It's your gig, though, so do what you want. I don't see much point in laboring this discussion any more; I'm just pointing out my observations."
199,notsarc,You only say that it won't make a change because you support the effects it will have.
200,notsarc,Genes transfered horizontally are as subject to selection as anyother form of gene. Once intergrated into the recieving genome they are simply one more heritable element and if they alter the phenotypes (many are either neutral or even inactivatee) then of course they are subject to selection. Why do you think otherwise? Remember that horizontal transfer is a rare event roughly on a par with ordinary mutations.
201,notsarc,What about the pain and death inflicted upon the innocent women and girls forced to give birth? Have you no regard for them?
202,notsarc,"You may see a vast differene, many do not. The ""moral"" grounds for many is simply the justification for their homophobia.   So now it's a massive nation wide government conspiracy to stifle free speech?   Canada stifles and oppresses religious freedom?   Honestly Jyoshu, where do you get this stuff?   This is utter BS, if you can find ANY proof of the Canadian gov't stifling free speech on this issue, religious freedom, or any other issue for that matter, please post it. If not, retract your BS statement, and admit that it's a fabrication.   I honestly don't think I underestimate it at all. I come across a very broad spectrum of people in my line of work, from one end of the scale to the other. The most common negative response I get is from those that are opposed to homosexuality in general and respond along the lines of ""I don't like, I don't want to see it, but rights are rights, as long as it doesn't negatively affect me, I don't have a problem with it/I don't really care."" I have come across a couple of people who were strongly opposed to the use of the term ""marriage"" but were fine with allowing homosexual ""civil unions"".   I think you overestimate how big of a ""moral issue"" this really is for most people.   Waxy"
203,notsarc,Please off one scientific piece of evidence in support of biblical creation.
204,notsarc,"Man, these guys can't even get into the science before they're outright lying..."
205,notsarc,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahahahahahaha. The deliberately out-of-context quotes again that directly contradict the conclusions of the authors.
206,notsarc,"What would you know about fair and balanced?   I know a lot of truths about gays. Do you want me to start posting incessant threads pointing them all out?   And I am the moderator for the formal debate forum, not the entire board. Want to debate me on the benefits of gays on society vs Christianity?"
207,notsarc,The main incentive for a male child is that in China you can only have one child without severe penalties and a female child means the family name is lost.
208,notsarc,I think such a move would qualify as a recognized declaration of war.
209,notsarc,Obviously not about abortion.
210,notsarc,"the reason why premise 1 can logically stand is that God is first of all defined as the ""greatest possible being"". no matter what reality we are considering, such a thing as the greatest possible being in that relity must exist. ""greatest"" is a superlative, compared to all other beings that exist   its like ""the oldest man alive"". no matter what scenario, such a person as the oldest man alive will always exist, therefore such a man (that fits that definition) will have a necessary existence"
211,notsarc,"Yep, he dodged it again. Care to explain your views on Creation in the Tanakh for the folks here?"
212,notsarc,"Well right there, you used an oxymoron, ""Great"" and ""Evangelist"" got together about as well as Military Inteligence.   Secondly, as I stated before...you left too many other questions unanswered about the ""Preacher."""
213,notsarc,Yes. The first one isolated was a frame-shift mutation on a plasmid. A fairly common source of useful mutations in bacteria.
214,notsarc,I'm glad to see you've finally come around.
215,notsarc,Actually your posts are providing increasing evidence for just how simple folks can get.
216,notsarc,Simple. The big government people will tell you that it's in everybody's best interest. The criminals will just kill you without debate.
217,notsarc,"And for good reason. Electrical engineers in general have a pretty poor track record when discussing issues that have nothing to do with... electrical engineering. Examples: Walter ReMine, Fred Williams, etc."
218,notsarc,"But I would have been interested in hearing how you explained the above points. My post was a quick hack job, looked up in a few books that I have along with stuff that I remember from my reading. I may have made an error and would be interested in hearing about it. Maybe I can defend my point of view, maybe I can't.   If you put time and effort into a response, why delete it. Redundant posts happen. ss/ww won't pay attention anyway and maybe he would respond to you. He runs from me because he always seems to make himself look like a fool and he realizes it."
219,notsarc,And Eisenhower:
220,notsarc,"Cornell's writings consistently place him within the collective right camp. Even the arguments that are attributed to him which start this thread show his collective right desire.   His claim to neutrality in the individual/collective right debate is as disingenuous as his interpretations of the SCOTUS opinions in both Miller and Cruikshank:   Greatest Threat to Second Amendment?   Greatest Threat to Second Amendment?   Whether ?neutral? or not, Cornell has proven himself capable of distorting SCOTUS opinions when he does not find that they suit his collective right tastes."
221,notsarc,How many opponents of liberal gun laws live in urban areas?
222,notsarc,If the fetus is human is not relevant? So if everyone says it is human then it still doesn't have a right to live then huh? Do you really support the killing of an innocent life for whatever reason? Do you really think placing one human over another is good (in this case women is more important then baby)?
223,notsarc,"Because when something passes every experiment thrown at it and when something fits observation better than anything else, then it's as near as damnit fact. We can get pedantic over this if you want, but the conclusion that reaches is that there are no facts."
224,notsarc,"uh, yeah, that was their intent! Under color of law no less. The truth always seems to be your worst enemy doesn't it?"
225,notsarc,A taste of what could be our future if the left has its way.
226,notsarc,"Well then this doesn't answer my question.   If you have 10 doctors for 100 people (this is just an example) and only 50 of them have health insurance and each doctor gets paid $100 a year then your health care per capita is $10 ([10doctors x $100]/100 people). If you change it to 100 people with health insurance you now have $10 per capita as well because you population did not change. Health care costs are shown per capita and not per person insured: Per Capita Health Expenditures by Country, 2007 &amp;mdash; Infoplease.com   So again, if you go from $6,000 per capita per that website given above to say Switzerland levels at $4,100 per capita then where did that money come from?"
227,notsarc,Oh you little tramp!
228,notsarc,"If atheism is a religion, than yes and atheism. If it's not then no.   _________________"
229,notsarc,"And I would like to know why that is. I asked the question in post #2 and got no answer. Are laypersons lacking in intelligence so much that it's hopeless for them to be on the same communication level with scientists? Since they share the same society, put their pants on one leg at a time in the same way, eat, sleep, and share economic processes in comparable ways, it seems to me it would be beneficial for them and laypersons both to understand each other when they use identical terms. (like the word, “theory”)"
230,notsarc,"And, what percentage is that? How was the poll conducted? Who conducted it? How was the determination made about who was a 'scientist'?"
231,notsarc,"Well, yeah, if science hasn't provided an explanation for a phenomenon, then all we can do is shrug and submit grant proposals."
232,notsarc,"Well, those who keep using that story can't see the real sins of those cities. They are so sure that it was rampent homosexuality which lead to their destruction. Even though we know that before the Angels were ever sent God had spelled out why he was going to destroy them. He sent the angels because they promiced to find even one righteous man. They failed in that because the angels were attacked for being foreigners. Noone who abuses this story is ever going to admit this fact. They can't see past the supposed homosexual issue."
233,notsarc,"Because I don't feel like copying and pasting articles into a forum when they can be easily accessed online. But for a quick summary: The CCR-5 gene mutation is present in about 15% of caucasians, with 1% having the homogeneous version. These 1% are completely immune. The heterogeneous people possess some immunity."
234,notsarc,Because...
235,notsarc,Yes. Only the ignorant think not.
236,notsarc,"Well, really, they both compensate and reciprocate for one another, you could say."
237,notsarc,"No. I am a student and I personally don't have much money. So how could I help them? I have very limited money of my own. I help when I can, but sometimes with my present finances I can't do much. If I had enough money, as I assume you do, than yes I would help them as much as I could. This is just an example of where people feel compassion. And as I have said before, Dawkin's has trouble explaining how the universal feelings could come about through evolution. We would not expect mutated pondscum to produce feelings and morals, ethics, etc."
238,notsarc,"No they don't. We didn't have a tyrannical society back in the 1830s when without a doubt personal autonomy didn't exist for some. The thing is, you don't have absolute personal autonomy now either. And it still doesn't answer my question about where the right came from, you just said there had to be one."
239,notsarc,"Look over the Heller ruling again. All nine judges agreed unanimously that the Second Amendment protected a right that was wholly individual in nature. The only disagreement was whether the right still applied today.   And no, the individual states and cities shouldn't be allowed to set their own standards for a constitutional right, that flies in the face of the 14th Amendment. And worse, you're arguing for precedent that would basically allow the various states to not respect your other rights; they could ban the shirt you choose to wear because it's offensive to some small, insignificant minority somewhere."
240,notsarc,"and thus a reason to support balanced reporting.   true, there are indisputable facts. say 3000 died.   but the interpretation of the facts are subjected to bias. the 3000 deserved to die as collaborators vs the 3000 were innocent and did not deserve to die."
241,notsarc,"Just like no one is really ""for"" abortions, but they think that it's the woman's right to decide. Maybe that's like when congress gave the President the right to decide to go to war, even when they were supposed to declare war."
242,notsarc,"Sure.   The woman is a person, and individual, sentient human being. She has the same right to control her bodily resources as any other person does. As such, you can no more force her, against her will, to provide bodily resources to an embryo or fetus, than you can yourself be forced to give of your bodily resources against your will.   Even if somebody is bleeding to death, and your blood can save their life, they still don't have the right to force you to safely give them of your blood.   Each person have that right to control their bodily resources. If you want to force the woman to remain pregnant, you are forcing her to give of her bodily resources against her will. When you don't insist that everybody else be subject to such requirements, then the argument is hypocritical and misogynistic.   And, of course the US Supreme Court agrees with this, thus ruling that per the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution, the woman has the right to privacy, to control her onw body."
243,notsarc,"Certainly science has provided part of the answer with their finding of the Mitachondrial ""Eve"", suggesting that one person can have all the DNA necessary for all the variation in human populations.   One of the standard rebuttals you hear is ""How did the Kangaroos get to Australia""? I don't know if that's covered in the Bible... if God transported them or not."
244,notsarc,"The other forest does not photosynthesize all year round, the other forest is also in just as much danger as the rainforest. For some reason, radical environmentalists choose to place undue emphasis on the de-forestation of rainforest rather than global forest as a whole."
245,notsarc,"Prove it. Got any credible scientific or sociological studies? NOPE, ya don't. Didn't think so."
246,notsarc,"Really? A lot of people say that every answer makes more questions. In some ways we seem to know less now than we did at the time of Newton, in that we are less certain.   And Newton's laws deal with what happens in a vacuum with no resistance, not direct human experience   At any rate, my point is that you can't see all the evidence as piling up support for 'science' as 'science' is moulded to fit that evidence. Not a criticism of science, btw."
247,notsarc,"Well, if you don't want a reaction, I would prefer if you not use the word ""god"" since it is loaded with so many other meanings and conotations than those you say you mean.   The choice between our two stances is indeed one between choosing a moral stance based on reasoned analysis (imperfect as that may be) and choosing a moral stance based on blind faith (i.e. not supported by evidence) in a moral code dictated by a religious authority.   You say that my moral code is a code that puts faith only in myself. That is not true. I very openly acknowledge that if I never had input from the outside - moral codes which were presented to me with the reasons behind them - then my moral code as determined solely by myself would have been meager indeed. I have had a wide range of influences which have helped determined my moral code:   - The moral codes of my folks during my upbringing   - The moral code of the moderate form of Roman Catholicism I grew up with   - The moral codes generally accepted by the moderate Democratic part of society   - The moral stances of friends   - The moral philosophy of Kant and other philosophers I have read about   I am sure that I could even come up with more than that. From all of those, I have gleaned a morality that works best for me, where my moral code seems to be quite a common one. The moral rules which I accepted were typically the ones which gave the reasons behind them and whose base assumptions I agreed with. The moral rules which I rejected were typically the ones which gave no supporting reasons or whose base assumptions I disagreed with. I suspect that you assume that if a morality is not grounded in religious rules, then it becomes based on selfishness. That is not true. We are all inspired by heroes that sacrifice themselves for others - be they secular or religious (as Jesus himself can be viewed as a hero).   There is a lot of overlap in morality between secular morality and religious (mainly Christian) morality - against theft, murder, etc. However, I find too many of the religious rules very arbitrary (such as the anti-Gay propaganda, some religion's ban on contraceptives, the idea of the infalibility of the pope, etc.) that I certainly will not follow religious rules blindly. Furthermore, so much of religious morality was determined simply by religious men who were set in the local morality of their time and attached that morality to the religion. Even if Jesus was divine, it would be very hard today to know how to throw away all the junk morality that was added after his time and extract the pure origin."
248,notsarc,"Whether or not the 2nd Amendment was written to provide for the protection of the States from a foreign invasion, or border dispute, or Civil War, it is clear that the objective of the 2nd Amendment is to address the basic provisions and control required to form a militia reporting to the President.   One of the provisions to form a militia is explicitly stated in the   2nd Amendment as the unrestricted Right of the individual to own guns.   At that time in our history, when a militia was formed, it was expected that individuals would bring their own gun(s) to the militia. That provision is THE IMPLICIT PURPOSE of the Right of the individual to own guns.   Within the 2nd Amendment, there are NO OTHER IMPLICIT, NOR EXPLICIT purposes pertaining to the unrestricted Right of the individual to own gun(s).   In other words, the 2nd Amendment does NOT IMPLICITLY, NOR EXPLICITLY suggest or expand its purpose beyond what it required for a militia, and the control of a militia.   The 2nd Amendment does NOT provide an individual the Right to own gun(s) for the PURPOSE OF providing for: food, self-defense, target practice, a hobby as a collector, or fun..   Therefore, ANY OTHER PURPOSE OR REASON for the possession of guns that has been attributed to rights under the 2nd Amendment is based entirely upon thoughts and purposes that were NOT IN THE MINDS OF the Founding Fathers when the 2nd Amendment was written.   The Founding Fathers knew many people required guns to provide for food, income, and home-defense. Yet, the Founding Fathers did not separate the purpose of the unrestricted Right of individuals to own guns for a militia, from the SOLE PURPOSE of owning guns for the creation of a militia.   The Founding Fathers did not write the 2nd Amendment in a manner that   would even suggest that the Right of an individual to own guns had purposes beyond a militia, that would provide for: food, self-defense, target practice, a hobby as a collector, or fun..   We may therefore conclude that, any reason or purpose for an individual owning a gun, OTHER THAN for a militia, is not provided for under the 2nd Amendment, and that current gun laws for private ownership of guns is mistaken.   Justifications or reasons to provide individuals with a Right to own guns for a purpose or reason other than a militia, would have to be based on some Amendment, other than the 2nd Amendment, to determine if any such Right exists for individual gun ownership exists.   That the Founding Fathers did not write all Amendments with the explicit and specific Rights of individuals for every condition and circumstance is self-explanatory, as the size of the Bill of Rights and the Constitution would be enormous, and the Founding Fathers would still be busy writing the Bill of Rights and a Constitution if that was the case.   However, the Founding Fathers were very careful in their use of words and phrases, and in the logical composition of a Constitution, and that they decided not to specify other purposes exist that justify individual gun ownership, beyond a militia, in the 2nd Amendment. That decision would appear to be intentional.   Although it might ideal to understand all that the Founding Fathers had in mind, when the Constitution was written, it must also be understood   and concluded that what was the basis for a rational giving the Founding Fathers reasons to create an Amendment, and chose specific terms, phrases, and specifics, may not exist today, nor even be of any importance.   For example, individuals need not carry guns from their home to where our troops will gather. Today?s ?militia? provides for the a militia?s need, and an individual?s need for guns. What the Founding Fathers once wrote with respect to an individual possessing a gun for the purpose of a militia and the remainder of the 2nd Amendment requires revision or elimination."
249,notsarc,"Apparently, all them dinosaurs were just too dumb to climb to higher ground or swim (despite the fact that animals are among the first to do so in disasters - example would be the tsunami in Christmas 2004) All of this also avoids the flying reptiles such as the Pteranodons.   Also, apparently humans are unique in that they are the only ones whose corpses bload and float to the water's surface.   What garbage will they come up with next?"

251,notsarc,"Yes...if you ignore people, they eventually go away...except for me, of course."
252,notsarc,"why the comparison of gun owners yo violent killers and serial rapists? What law have I broken? Since we are doing comparisons your anti-freedom agenda is very similar to the bazi gun control laws of the 1930s, it is like the jim crow laws of the US. Your agenda is one of racism. This is insulting, ignorant, and shows your true colors as an enemy of freedom."
253,notsarc,I say that you need to take into consideration the number of criminals that'll disregard the lock and try and break down the door anyway. That's why smart people don't rely exclusively on locks and security systems for their own protection.
254,notsarc,"The definition of manslaughter is when one's actions, which end up killing someone, display a reckless disregard for the dangers of the situation. That's not a proper legal definition, but it'll do.   Now, you want to argue that pro-lifers would be forced into the counterintuitive conclusion that ALL miscarriage is manslaughter, and thus their position is ridiculous. I'm saying that they would only be forced to admit that a very small portion of miscarriage is manslaughter, and a portion that they would probably be willing to make a case for.   I'm not saying ""miscarriage is not manslaughter,"" but only ""miscarriage is not always manslaughter."" For example, if a woman took perfectly good care of herself and did nothing dangerous, but had a miscarriage anyway, she would obviously not have committed manslaughter. If a woman had one drink with dinner, but she was carrying a very unhealthy fetus and it died, then she would not have committed manslaughter, because that was not reckless. I pointed out the ""you-shouldn't-be-drinking-and-having-unprotected-sex"" argument as a position somebody might hold, but I think that it would probably be judged as unrepresentative of the definition of manslaughter.   So obviously, miscarriage cannot be manslaughter in the sense of ""every instance of A is an instance of B."""
255,notsarc,"So even though you can legally conceal carry right up to the gate of the national parks, and you can legally hunt within the parks, somehow concealed carry in the parks will become more dangerous?"

257,notsarc,"Well, you have ""proved"" that the U.S. health insurance does not have any higher administrative cost than Medicare or the rest od the industrialized world. I think your problem is that you are convinced in your head that that in our healthcare there is no waste. And you are trying to square it with the obvious fact that our cost is the highest with nothing to show for it. You will have to admit that there is waste.   For example we have 5x as many MRI scanners than we need, we perform too many tests, we have high adminstrative cost. All these costs will be reduced. There will be fewer of these things PER INSURED. I do not know how many times I have to repeat this before you get it. The volume of this work PER INSURED will decrease. Do you understand that?"
258,notsarc,I hope I have already begun to change your mind.

260,notsarc,"Well, kind of a boring thread, since everyone agrees, but since I'm new here, I may as well weigh in. Hubby and I have three grown kids and one teen. The grown ones all got the same going-to-college gifts. They got a safe car, a laptop, an emergency credit card, and a personal firearm. I felt this especially important for our daughters."

262,notsarc,Exactly.   It seems that anyone can dream up hypotheses in evolutionary psychology.   Here's what Coyne said:
263,notsarc,"Here's an interesting one:   Lipoprotein Lipase S447X: A Naturally Occurring Gain-of-Function Mutation.   Brief Reviews   Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis &amp; Vascular Biology. 26(6):1236-1245, June 2006.   Rip, Jaap; Nierman, Melchior C.; Ross, Colin J.; Jukema, Jan Wouter; Hayden, Michael R.; Kastelein, John J.P.; Stroes, Erik S.G.; Kuivenhoven, Jan Albert   Abstract:   mdash;: Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) hydrolyzes triglycerides in the circulation and promotes the hepatic uptake of remnant lipoproteins. Since the gene was cloned in 1989, more than 100 LPL gene mutations have been identified, the majority of which cause loss of enzymatic function. In contrast to this, the naturally occurring LPLS447X variant is associated with increased lipolytic function and an anti-atherogenic lipid profile and can therefore be regarded as a gain-of-function mutation. This notion combined with the facts that 20% of the general population carries this prematurely truncated LPL and that it may protect against cardiovascular disease has led to extensive clinical and basic research into this frequent LPL mutant. It is only until recently that we begin to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the beneficial effects associated with LPLS447X. This review summarizes the current literature on this interesting LPL variant.   This one provides rather good protection from hardening of the arteries.

PRIJAMBADA, SEIJI NEGORO,* TETSUYA YOMO, AND ITARU URABE   Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Engineering, Osaka University, 2-1 Yamada-oka, Suita, Osaka 565, Japan   Through selective cultivation with 6-aminohexanoate linear dimer, a by-product of nylon-6 manufacture, as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO, which initially has no enzyme activity to degrade this xenobiotic compound, was successfully expanded in its metabolic ability. Two new enzyme activities, 6-aminohexanoate cyclic dimer hydrolase and 6-aminohexanoate dimer hydrolase, were detected in   the adapted strains.   http://aem.asm.org/cgi/reprint/61/5/2020.pdf   We thought it would take roughly a million years for bacteria to evolve enzymes capable of digesting nylon (because the compound is so different than any they were able to digest) but it took less than a century.

267,notsarc,So what? If somebody wants to die then they'll kill themselves no matter what.
268,notsarc,my my you are up on the current events. Thanks for shedding light on this for everyone here.
269,notsarc,So the founding fathers and their work is basicy viewed as an authority based on their competence?
270,notsarc,Please explain this statement.
271,notsarc,"Well now, there you go. . . .RIGHT ON!!"
272,notsarc,"This was a comment on the physics book that has biographies of great physicists that were Bible believing christians. Right. Many believed in alchemy (they were wrong), harmful effects of night air (they were wrong), spontaneous growth of maggots from rotting meat (they were wrong), rats arising from grain (they were wrong), and the Bible (they were wrong). If it is important that Newton believed in the Bible, why isn't it as important that he believed in alchemy and did not believe in the divinity of Christ.   There isn't any such thing as science from a Christian perspective. Either it is science, or it isn't.   You claimed to have studied evolution. You didn't. Why would you tell us that you did?"
273,notsarc,"You know, I would be fine with that as long as it were truly a middle ground. If that term were used equally among straights as well as gays.   But it's just a term. The same as with the term ""marriage.""   It's just a term. Just a word.   Personally I feel the government needs to get out of the business of marriage altogether.   Let the legal term be agreed upon unilaterally."
274,notsarc,"WOW simone, are you kidding me? You will use this story as an example of how dangerous giving birth is on this American forum by referring to a story from Sub Saharan Africa? And you consider this a rational argument? Here's another quote from your link: Fistulas are a scourge of the poor, affecting two million women and girls, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia   So tell us, PLEASE!!! How is this an argument which justifies abortions in America where Fistulas is virtually unknown as a result of child birth? Tell me how this quoted section below applies to any aspect of medical care in the USA.   The women filled most of Ward 2, a long, one-story building with a cement floor and two rows of closely spaced beds against opposite walls. All had suffered from obstructed labor, meaning that their babies were too big or in the wrong position to pass through the birth canal. If prolonged, obstructed labor often kills the baby, which may then soften enough to fit through the pelvis, so that the mother delivers a corpse.   Obstructed labor can kill the mother, too, or crush her bladder, uterus and vagina between her pelvic bones and the baby&#8217;s skull. The injured tissue dies, leaving a fistula: a hole that lets urine stream out constantly through the vagina. In some cases, the rectum is damaged and stool leaks out. Some women also have nerve damage in the legs.   One of the most striking things about the women in Ward 2 was how small they were. Many stood barely five feet tall, with slight frames and narrow hips, which may have contributed to their problems. Girls not fully grown, or women stunted by malnutrition, often have small pelvises that make them prone to obstructed labor."
275,notsarc,"We Americans do not care the government of the UK now under the control of sharia law hates freedom.   America is a Constitutional Republic where the Bill of rights secure our freedom.   I seem to recall you brits coming over here and demanding we lay down our guns and it did not go so well. And neither will it go well for any us politician's that try it as well. America has no reason to listen to people in the uk about gun control and now Knife control when its shockingly clear that criminals can still get any gun they want. Not to mention the fact that history has shown that time and time again what happens when the government wants its citizens to turn in the tools of freedom what happens.   ""God grants liberty only to those who love it, and are always ready to guard and defend it."" - Daniel Webster   ""Government is not reason. It is not eloquence. It is a force, like fire: a dangerous servant and a terrible master."" - George Washington   ""With reasonable men I will reason; with humane men I will plead; but with tyrants, I will give no quarter, nor waste arguments where they will certainly be lost."" - William Lloyd Garrison   # ""If gun laws in fact worked, the sponsors of this type of legislation should have no difficulty drawing upon long lists of examples of crime rates reduced by such legislation. That they cannot do so after a century and a half of trying that they must sweep under the rug the southern attempts at gun control in the 1870-1910 period, the northeastern attempts in the 1920-1939 period, and the attempts at both Federal and State levels in 1965-1976 - establishes the repeated, complete, and inevitable failure of gun laws to control crime."" -- Senator Orrin G.

277,notsarc,"But if the repeated tests just confirm the same errors or misinterpretations of the results, all of the independent reviews in the World wont make a difference."
278,notsarc,"Some apply logic, some do not. So much for contradictory thinking.   What evidence do you have that suggests logic exists outside of the human mind? Hold the mythology, please.   from infidels.org -   The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines logic as ""the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference."" Logic will let you analyze an argument or a piece of reasoning, and work out whether it is likely to be correct or not.   It's worth mentioning a couple of things which logic is not.   Firstly, logical reasoning is not an absolute law which governs the universe. Many times in the past, people have concluded that because something is logically impossible (given the science of the day), it must be impossible, period. It was also believed at one time that Euclidean geometry was a universal law; it is, after all, logically consistent. Again, we now know that the rules of Euclidean geometry are not universal."
279,notsarc,"You are free to disagree with the article, Chemist99a, but it was written by a scientist. You are quite free to believe biological complexity is the result of ""natural selection"" somehow organizing a bunch of genetic accidents into complex biological systems.

281,notsarc,President Obama!? What did I win!?
282,notsarc,"Well, in the case above, it was step-by-step. First, an existing enzyme was modified to a new use, and over time, became refined to work better and better. This is the way evolution works. Nothing is de novo; it's always a modfication of something else. Second, a mutation produced a regulator that only allowed the enzyme to be produced if the substrate was available. Again, this was refined by natural selection over time. In the end, the newly-evolved system was irreducibly complex, because all three parts have to be present for the system to work.   And do show us your numbers proving that such processes can't produce new information. If you don't know how, I'd be pleased to show you how a mutation changes the information in a population."
283,notsarc,"I believe abortion is murder and should be illegal. The only possible circumstance when an abortion should be an option is when the “LIFE” of both the mother and her unborn child is at risk. When both lives are going to be lost, it is better to save one as opposed to losing two. The holocaust on the unborn children of this country is something that we should be ashamed of as a country."
284,notsarc,Uh...yeah? Is there some other way than evolution this can happen? Evolution encompasses speciation which results from evolution taking different paths when populations are separated by some factor in their environment or geographically.   Are you saying you believe that the species have all somehow resulted from a common genome yet at the same time rejecting evolution as an explanation?
285,notsarc,"I would say that the soul is that part of us that is immortal. It is our essence. Our personality may impact or is impacted by it, but I would say it is far more. Indeed, I would say it is what psychologists call emergent downward causality.   As for the role of God, science has not disproven any of it. Science has explained how things occur but that does not eliminate the possibility of god nor does it limit what god does. We would simply not be understanding gods fit in the science of it. That makes sense given that god is considered infinite and we are finite. I think the soul is what gives us the possibility of even imagining the infinite. The idea that we can see beyond what we are or even to conceptualize such things gives a clue that there is more to us than meets the eye.   I do not see why God and science cannot coexist. Even evolution and creation. Forget planting evidence. That is too far fetched. I would rather think that it is more likely that what God says actually fits the evidence even though we cannot understand it. I do not know about God or ""not god"" (if you will) but if there is a God then the idea that he is beyond what I can actually conceive and yet completely conceivable makes sense for that kind of being. It should be an apparent paradox to me. If it is not, then my concept of God is faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr to small to be of any use to anyone.   Huck."
286,notsarc,"Well sigma, which is more painful??   Being burnt with salene for 30 minutes to an hour and if that doesnt work after the 3rd time, being born prematurally and laid on a table and starving to death.....   OR   A woman sticking a clothes hanger up and accidentally killing herself but intentionally killing the kid within her?   seems to me that people dont really care about how the baby feels. It has just as much feeling as the mother."
287,notsarc,How many court decisions have said that it is unconstitutional to regulate guns in any way?
288,notsarc,"What basis do fundamental rights derive from? In other words, how can we tell whether something is a fundamental human right?"
289,notsarc,"So, your saying an eyewitness would mean nothing. Yeah right."
290,notsarc,"No, but the Roman persecution of Christians, covering Christians in pitch, Roman garden parties, witnesses for Christ being killed for their faith etc. is as irrelevant as it gets. Just be careful, that's all I'm saying. There is a place for that topic."
291,notsarc,"Actually, not at all true. The organisms of the Cambrian look little like modern animals. It is only the major phyla that are recognized by the derived characteristics. For example, the cordates first arise in the early Cambrian, along with primitive inverebrates. You can safely say that no animal living today looks much like any living then. For example, there were no amphibians, no reptiles, no insects, no birds, and of course, no mammals.   Your shotgun approach isn't actually worth answering in any detail. It isn't even your work."
292,notsarc,"Sure you do . Because like any reprobate, what is wrong, is right to you; and what is right, is wrong to you. So of course you consider anything i believe to be wrong. But just so my original statement isn't lost to your attack, here it is again so it can be clearly interpreted without your tainted condemnation.   Archangel The ugly reality of life in America today regarding the secular humanist Left is that they support free speech as long as you agree with them. If you disagree with them, you are branded as a religious zealot who's determined to take their rights away. What they don't want you to ever realize is that it is they who are tearing at the traditions and customs that America was built upon and gained us the respect of the World at large. And it is their corruption of the morals and values America once represented that is the cause of so much hatred and disrespect from the rest of the World today.   So thanks to the liberal immoral left, we are seen as the moral evil of the World. Not because of the Religious Right as the Left would have you believe."
293,notsarc,"Nobody I know sanctions adultery. There are already serious consequences built in against it. As far a same sex marriage, I know of nobody that is suggesting legal penalties for it unless one considers the refusal to legally recognize it a legal penalty. Certainly nobody has been jailed or fined for attempting such marriages. Privately performed ceremonies as such are not punished."
294,notsarc,"And when supersport says that the fossil record was created by god to test the faith of the people? He could make his hypothesis unfalsifiable, and he wouldn't care that it would be unscientific."

This is a metaphysical debate that is decades old and it simply depends upon your point of view for the purpose of the discussion at hand."
296,notsarc,You know how those anti-gunners are?they just kinda get stuck in that same old revolving door.Can't come up with anything new so they rehash.
297,notsarc,"You know, that sounds exactly what you are doing. I guess you are as foolish as they are."
298,notsarc,Really? What evidence is that?
299,notsarc,"23,000 firearms were handed in when the UK had its gun ban. According to your logic those people that handed in their firearms can still be prosecuted because they took possession of a firearm prior to the ban. I don't think so."
300,notsarc,"You're right, I think he has made such comments. Sorry. I think he's wrong and went too far."
301,notsarc,"Do the words ""govt. by the people and for the people"" not matter to you at all? Furthermore, to say that the constitution shouldn't be allowed under the vote of the people itself in unconstitutional, since that's the only way the Constitution CAN be amended. (2/3 of states)   A country that uses judges to determine such sweeping things as redefining marriage is a ""legistocracy"", which we are quickly turning into as a nation. Even though judges are supposed to interpret the constitution, it's still putting the fate of the people in the hands of individuals regarding their laws. This is not very far removed from monarchy. Personally, I think our founding fathers and the Constitutional framers are rolling over in their graves right now."
302,notsarc,"Well, if you breed them, you could get taller monkeys with less hair (and other humanlike characteristics). Even so, it would take a long time."
303,notsarc,"President Obama has correctly characterized the Bill of Rights is a list of negative Rights against government.   The point is, that the only rights that the government, and or any anti-gunner, or department has, is the infringements we grant them through laws etc.   Taking the info in this article at face value. What was a legal practice to do just yesterday landed this guy in a jackpot for not knowing what or how the Govt. is going to interpret the law to mean today. This is a common problem with, and not to directly pick on the ATF, but gun dealers complain about this all the time. EVEN an FBI agent himself cannot predict, nor curry a favorable interpretation.   What kind of country and legal system do we want? Surely you can see that this kind of stuff is not in ANY WAY Shape of Form, fair to do to a Right that our Constitution says is Inalienable. Or to a person who was an impeccable reputation.   Would you like to be treated in this manner?   The article says, what he did is not illegal, but in the hands of someone with an axe to grind, maybe they didn't like him, or maybe the prosecutor is Anti-gun etc, lands this guy in a jackpot!

To be able to put into question the love of another human being is simply not only alarming in nature, but damning to the very definition of love, equality, and freedom in creation of man....   And to trump this as a question of morality only serves as a mask to curtail the prejudice objections one personally has to a ceremony, right, and relationship that person will not even be personally affected by...."

310,notsarc,"Well, Google is your friend here - try fossil and see what you get. Alternatively click the link in my sig and look in the archive section at Talk Origins.   It is not possible to break fossilisation down into such simple notions as ""one big preservation event"" and lots of ""little preservations"". If you can think of some examples of fossils then we can examine them more specifically as what can be said about the circumstances of their preservation.   I've been a bit vague here as it is a) such a broad subject to describe succinctly b) I'm tired and c) I'm full of cold   No doubt someone who isn't under the influence of b) and/or c) will chime in as well with more details while I pull round.   Now, where was my hankerchief......"
311,notsarc,"Well, I am a creationist, and I would hope I can think logically (it's generally a good quality for an accountant and tax attorney to have). The difference between microevolution and evolution as an explanation for the beginning of a species is simple. In microevolution a species is simply adapting to it's environments. In evolution as is usually meant by the word you are talking about the formation of an entirely new creature from inorganic compounds. If this is possible I pose a few questions for you.   1) Why have no new creatures evolved from inorganic compounds in human memory?   2) How did these inorganic compounds decide that some creatures should evolve, while others of the same species did not? Why are there not some apes that have evolved into humans by now? Why didn't all apes evolve into humans?   3) One of my favorite pieces of confusion from evolutionists involve fossils. How do you know how old a fossil is? Every evolutionist I have asked has stated that fossils are dated by the rock layer they are found in, but if you then ask them how the rock layer is dated they answer that it is dated by the fossils that where discovered in it! That's a classical example of circular reasoning.   I am not a scientist, so I cannot present all the evidence against evolution as clearly as someone with a scientific education and background might do. If you are truly interested in learning more about the creationist arguments against evolution you can check out the article located at http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs2004/1106ng.asp. This article also has many links to other articles with even more information."
312,notsarc,"What, specifically, are you witnessing? A baby being born? A prayer apparently being answered? A near miss? Mysterious coincidences that you interpret as being the work of God? Or do you see dead people rising up out of the grave? And people walking on water? And people turning water into wine and feeding a crowd with a small amount of food?   What kind of miracles are we talking about here?"
313,notsarc,"Yep. Here in the U.S., the 5.7 ammo is the ordinary hollow point for Civilian use. It does not penetrate. It is not Armor Piercing."
314,notsarc,"Among the icons (idols) of modern mysticism there is one that reigns supreme. It is the myth of evolution. We scoff at the gods of the anchient pagans as if we were untouched by their superstition and yet we mystify our science with the likes of Darwin, the high priest of natural selection. Darwin taught a fable that started in a warm little pond and through a process that has became known as gradualism (minute changes over eons) all life arose out of a primordial soup.   Life is not chaotic it is orderly and requires replication. Without this you just have a lot of chemicals mixing in an infinite variety. The reason that life must be derived from life (biogenesis) in the minds of most is that this is the only way we have ever seen it happen. ""You can imagine anything you like but you can only understand the truth"" as Newton said. Now if amino acids are the mirror image of nucleic acid sugars and this in true of all living things then we are limited to this as fundamental to life. This in my opinion is the fundamental first step and it cannot happen peicemeal, it all has to happen all at once.   One more thing, evolution is a biogenesis theory and actual evidence for abiogenesis is rare and fragmentary just as it is for every other aspect of the single common ancestor model."
315,notsarc,"I'm afraid you're wrong, as I created you in my universe, and implanted in you a belief that you were a god. It lead you to make statements about the truth of your own beliefs, which I'm afraid are just self-beliefs with no real evidence.   Sorry."
316,notsarc,But I think that is the point. What if you didn't agree with the germ theory of disease? Does that mean that it shouldn't be taught in health classes in our schools? Should it be replaced by the bad humors of night air theory? But not everyone agrees with that theory either.
317,notsarc,You haven't proven anything. All you have done is spew your same old drivel which ignores what I actually say and reinterprets it to mean what you want it to say. You must corrupt what I say since you can't accept the truth of my beliefs and win your fallacious argument.
318,notsarc,"But I don't hear you saying things like ""baseball is always harmful to the player"" or ""baseball is something no one should have to go through.""   You see, if pro-choicers only used the 'pregnancy-is-bad-if-forced argument, they might have a point, but they often don't add the last part.   Besides, no one ever forces a woman to get pregnant in the first place."
319,notsarc,Who swings from Christmas cake to chrismas cake?   Tarzipan!
320,notsarc,"No it doesn't, as abortion WAS a legal option in this case.   This was not a legality issue, but an education issue."
321,notsarc,"You are getting to a more complicated area where ""mental existence"" no longer matters. I've explained earlier that it isn't exactly the same as ""self defense"" so I don't think a similiar response is needed. Furthermore, you are saying mental existence is not solely the thing that gives you value but rather it depends on outside influences and chance.   At some point it just seems like the stance on abortion is that the woman is more important no matter what. This is why I claim some will rank humans above other humans...a dangerous precedent which we have tried before."
322,notsarc,"Sure, here ya go...   Radiocarbon Dating"
323,notsarc,"Because of the rare nature of fossilisation, we don't expect to see perfect transitional lineages through millions and millions of years. I really don't think there are any scientists that think there SHOULD be millions and millions of transitions, because of the nature of fossilisation.   Science is like a detective story. If you wanted to solve a murder, for example, you take a look at the evidence. You have a gun, spent rounds, dead body etc. To convict someone of a murder, you need fingerprints, blood on clothes, DNA and such to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person you are accusing actually shot the deceased and you can convict WITHOUT an eye witness.   It's the same for science and the fossil record, because there is no-one around who directly observed animals undertaking large changes over time. But if you take a look at the fossil record, molecular biology, geological time etc, this is what it shows. From what we understand from the last 100 or so years of evidence and investigation, biological evolution is the best scientific explanation we have for the diversity of life on earth.   3 questions for Calligirl.   For the 4th time. What would be YOUR definition of a transitional form?   When calculating the age of this earth, how precise do you expect or want scientists to get?   How many transitional fossils would you LIKE to see in what period of time?   I really don't think this will progress if you can't tell us what it is you would like to see."
324,notsarc,OH? What U.S. Code governs that? What does it say?
325,notsarc,"Oh, so you were not in any way talking about evolution in these posts? Then why are they posted on the c vs e board?   Please, that's just pathetic."
326,notsarc,"But you haven't looked. You may claim that your god did it, and no evidence to support or deny that can be offered. The assertion relies on miracle and has no suporting evidence. But when you start talking about how your god did it, your claims can be debunked by facts. Certainly the mythology of ancient nomadic herdsmen is not accurate. If you look at the world and the history of the world the is evident in the geologic strata, then you can see that the earth is very old, and you can see a succession of organisms through time. When considered with other fields of science from genetics to biogeography to physiology and anatomy, evolution becomes apparent."
327,notsarc,Actually they do. Whether or not you think they should is another matter entirely. Did you not notice where the article came from? From a paper in India.

329,notsarc,"No I don't think that tying your tubes is abortion. I only think abortion comes into play when there is actually cells forming to make a baby, and you get them scraped out, or abort a baby before or after the third trimester. Plus I heard that if you tie the tubes, when you decide you want a baby you can untie the tubes, to conceive a baby. But burning is another thing. But unless there is actual cells forming it is not abortion"

I will use a bazooka if there is tank comming down the street. The immediate threat I am thinking of is a felon with bare hands on parole. That is exactly what the anti-gunners are trying to limit me from doing. Limit my right to self-preservation from a felon on parole.

It's no more challenging than shooting fish in a barrel, and no more satisfying than destroying a child's faith in the tooth fairy.   But I do take offence at you characterizing my ability to reason logically and to think with some originality as being nothing more than 'manipulation' and sophistry."
336,notsarc,"So are you saying that if one person prays for another person who is sick, that if the praying person believes enough then some power of belief within him is great enough to heal another person who has no such beliefs, but that isn't a miracle that can be attributed to God, but is just something the person praying accomplished because they believed enough ?   So when I laid hands on my 9 month old daughter and prayed for her healing in Jesus name, when she then within 5 seconds opened her eyes and went from completely listless with a 103 degree temp to wide awake, happy and affectionate as she smiled at me with bright little eyes, are you saying that something within me transfered to her to bring about that instant result ? If that is true, then you must admit that something supernatural still happened, it's just that the power to heal transfered from me instead of from God whom I asked to heal her in Jesus name.   Now mind you, I totally reject that, as I know it was God healing my daughter because I know rationally speaking, that I have no supernatural powers within me. And I truly understand how difficult it is for someone who has never personally experienced a miracle to not be skeptical about miracles or the supernatural, and maybe if I had experienced only one in my life then I too might question if it really happened.   But I have had numerous Angelic interventions that cannot be denied. And the personal spirit filled contacts with my heavenly Father on a daily basis is more than one such as I am can even fully appreciate or comprehend. Because you see, I am a sinner and completely unworthy to be in Gods presence at all, yet He has lived within me and fellowshipped with me each and every day of my life since I accepted Jesus as my Savior in August of 1975. And if you want to believe me, 2 of the Angelic interventions I experienced happened before I was even saved in August of 75. So as it is written, before the foundation of the World, God Knew me. And while I was yet in the womb, He knew me. And while I was in the womb, He knew the number of hairs on my head. So also, even before I accepted Jesus and was born again, my Father in Heaven knew me, loved me and protected me until the day of my salvation.   This is why I'm so adamant and stubborn in my belief and can not be moved by any unbelief. If I denied Jesus and Gods truth with all of the personal and first hand supernatural experiences I have had, I would be less worthy than the greatest evil doer and unbeliever in the world to receive Gods Grace and Love as I have. I have prophesied, spoken in the language of the Angels, been supernaturally saved from drowning, been saved from a violent attack which may have led to my murder as I had 5000 in cash on me at the time. But my Guardian Angel intervened and ran the muggers off and they never found the money. That was just one of the interventions and all I did when i saw the trouble coming was say within my mind, ""Lord Jesus, help me"". Nothing I did stopped the attack, nor could it have as these people had murder in their eyes. I had never seen such cold blooded hatred in any persons eyes before as was in this one guy. And yet within seconds I saw that rage in his eyes turn to abject terror as he looked past me, then he said to me, the next time I'll kill you and they ran away like total cowards. When I turned around to see who had scared them so much and looked exactly where they looked when they looked over my shoulder, you know what i saw ? Absolutely nothing. There was nobody there at all, no human anyway."
337,notsarc,The question is illogical. By declaring the existence of an all powerful God then saying God cannot do something is not a comment on his powerfulness but rather the direct representation of his nature. Your question by its very statement does not test wether or not God is all powerful but wether or not God is comprehensible. See another thread for that topic.   The statement that God is all powerful defines his nature. To state then that he cannot do something outside of his nature as proof of the non existence of his nature is circular in logic.

So who are you people to even judge the intelligence of those who will ultimately be proven to have known the truth regarding our origins, to the lies that you so proudly defend?   I say this only so you pseudo intellectuals will have some personal introspection to consider rather than just assuming that you'll get the correct answers by leaning on human understanding. It is incredible that you can't even see that you are bankrupt when you rely on unprovable assumptions that are based on preconceived notions, that have been both failing and conflicting with all of the new discoveries made in each generation to follow, thereby forcing the need to redefine the parameters by which evolution works every 10 years or so.   So evolution isn't a science, it's a working piece of fiction in progress that is constantly being tweaked and shaped to fit the preconceptions no matter what new evidence is discovered that contradicts it."
349,notsarc,We agree!   Excellent!
350,notsarc,"In point of fact, the low birth rate in most of Europe is not due to the availablity of abortion, but to good sex education and the ready availablity of effective contraception to everyone who needs it.

353,notsarc,"Jurassic Theropods like Compsognathus had hollow bones.   http://www.cbv.ns.ca/marigold/histor...gnathuspic.jpg   Therepodian dinosaurs show clear general skeletal affinities with modern birds such as long limbs, hollow bones, foot with 3 toes in front and 1 reversed toe behind and a long ilium.   Coelophysis, from the late Triassic was one of the first theropod dinosaurs.   Deinonychus and Oviraptor from the late Triassic to the Cretaceous were bipedal advanced theropods, larger, with more bird-like skeletal features: semilunate carpal, bony sternum, long arms and reversed pubis. Striking detailed similarity to birds.   There is a gap in the fossil record here although Protoavis could belong here, unfourtunately, the fossil is poor.   Archaeopteryx from 225 Ma, shows a mosaic of reptilian and avian features, with the reptilian features predominating. The skull and skeleton are basically reptilian (skull, teeth, vertebrae, sternum, ribs, pelvis, tail, digits, claws, generally unfused bones). Bird traits are limited to an avian furcula (wishbone, for attachment of flight muscles; recall that at least some dinosaurs had this too), modified forelimbs, and -- the real kicker -- unmistakable lift-producing flight feathers. Archeopteryx could probably flap from tree to tree, but couldn't take off from the ground, since it lacked a keeled breastbone for large flight muscles, and had a weak shoulder compared to modern birds. (Wellnhofer, 1993)   S. santensis from 138 Ma was a better flyer than Archaeopteryx. It had a short trunk, claws on the toes, flight-specialized shoulders, stronger flight- feather bones, tightly folding wrist and short hands.   A not yet named bird/dino from 131 Ma has a reptilian pelvis and legs, with bird-like shoulders. The tail is medium-length with a fused tip.   Then there's Hesperornis, Ichthyornis, and other Cretaceous diving birds. There are many fossils. Their skeleton is further modified for flight showing fusion of pelvis bones, fusion of hand bones and a short, fused tail). It also still had true socketed teeth, a reptilian trait.   There are others and this is by no mean exhaustive. This is just to show that there are very good transition lineages.   Although no modern birds have teeth, chicken bills can be induced to develop teeth, indicating that chickens still retain the genes for making teeth.   There is also an intriguing fossil Microraptor gui that has flight feathers on both the front and back legs.   http://eur.news1.yimg.com/eur.yimg.c...2567138235.jpg   I can provide more info on any of these if you wish.

The problem is there is no faith in evolution, faith is a belief in something with no proof. Evolution has proof. Therefore it cannot be a faith based idea. A typical creationist attack is to misrepresent their target by creating a strawman of it. They then declare it is wrong and by proxy, the actual theory wrong.

377,notsarc,"Then a man who needs an artificial heart to survive is a new species of man. That is the analogy I gave, and you ignored.   In both cases; human and bacteria, before the advent of a human product, a particular group of individuals from each larger group would die off.   BUT along come a man-made invention that allows those certain portions to live on which otherwise would have died. In once case - nylon, the other, the artificial heart. You call this evolution.   Nor is it 'natural selection' at work either, as in both cases the thing that enabled them to survive was not natural. What you have advanced as a proof of evolution actually proves what? Natural what? I suppose people with cochlear implants are new species too because they've learnt to hear.   Another view of this nylon-eating-bug is given...   ""Finally, Mr Cerutti is out of date about this new nylon digesting ability allegedly from a frame shift. New evidence shows that the ability was due to plasmids [e.g. K. Kato, et al., ?A plasmid encoding enzymes for nylon oligomer degradation: Nucleotide sequence analysis of pOAD2?, Microbiology (Reading) 141(10):2585?2590, 1995.] In fact, more than one species of bacteria have the ability, residing on plasmids. This suggests that the information probably already existed, and was just passed between different types of bacteria.""   ""All that would be needed to enable an enzyme to digest nylon is a mutation causing loss of specificity in a proteolytic (protein-degrading) enzyme. This may seem surprising? How would a loss of information create a new ability? Answer: enzymes are usually tuned very precisely to only one type of molecule (the substrate). Loss of information would reduce the effectiveness of its primary function, but would enable it to degrade other substrates, too. Since both nylon and proteins are broken down by breaking amide linkages, a change in a proteolytic enzyme could also allow it to work on nylon. If this process were continued, the result would be a general enzyme with a weakly catalytic effect on the hydrolysis of too many chemicals to be useful where much selectivity is required. To put it into perspective, acids and alkalis also catalyze many hydrolysis reactions, but they also lack specificity. Indeed, an inhibitor of a protein degrading enzyme also inhibits the action of the nylon degrading enzyme""   http://www.answersingenesis.org/home...e7-24-2000.asp   Talkorigins gave their usual doubletalk   ""Whilst this particular case does not ""prove"" evolution, it is consistent with, and supportive of, the theory of biological evolution.""   Why do they say this? Because it's still a bacteria. It's not like it suddenly became a large multi-cellular organism. But it might just prove that this bug was so well designed that it can cope with newer situations. One site does say that it, the bacteria, had the capability already within it of change ? not resultant in ?mutations?, but more like switching on previously dormant apparatus. http://members.tripod.com/aslodge/id89.htm   One poster on another forum summed the problem up like this...   "" In order for species to advance there would have to be a net information gain, which isn't the case with nylon eating bacteria.   The bacteria gained the ability to digest nylon, therefore was able to survive in a new environment. Two distinct advantages   But, the bacteria lost its ability to survive in its old environment, eat its former diet and suffered a 98% loss in efficiency. Three disadvantages.   So by taking two steps forward and three steps backward, where is the net gain?   If nylon eating bacteria was ""proof"" of evolution, we would still be pond scum, but with the ability to digest whatever happened to become the primary food source.""   http://www.christianforums.com/t52336"

Just because all of science contradicts your childish belief in mythology doesn't mean that all science is evolution. Because cosmology contradicts your mythology, it must be evolution. Because astronomy contradicts your mythology, it must be evolution. Because geology contradicts your mythology, it must be evolution.   And that is why creationists are such scary people. Their morality comes from a book and threats of eternal punishment. The fundamentalist christian morality is so shallow that they are unable to conceive that others can actually have a higher morality based on self respect.   And that is meaningless babble.

Later, in the renewal of interest in the adequate teaching of science in the U.S. in the 1960s, there arose more modern ""creation science."" It began by adopting the flood geology of the 7th Day Adventists as the base.   Creation science begins with the assertion the the creation stories, the flood story, even the mythology of Job and Jonah, are literally true. Creation scientists then attempt to distort the evidence to support this particular version of the Bible. When creationists realized that the biological evolution of species does occur, they decided that God had created original ""kinds"" and then allow hyper evolution after that.

I don't have to like the choices someone else makes, and I don't have to agree with it, but while I have that right, I also believe that people should have the right to make those decisions. Are these anti-abortion people going to step in and pay for the cost of having the baby, raising it, etc..??? Maybe some of those are the issues people consider when having an abortion. Maybe the woman was raped. I see the point when someone said that the baby should not be punished for that, and I agree with that, but the rape was committed against the woman's will... she didn't ask for that to happen, and if a pregnancy results from that, that is also against her will, so why should she feel that she has to have the child? What does she tell the child when it decides to ask who its father is?? The child could still be born and given up for adoption, and that is a good idea, but maybe the woman will relive the rape throughout the pregnancy by being reminded of it on a daily basis.... all I feel is until it happens to you, and YOU are forced to make these kinds of choices, you shouldn't judge anyone else for the choices that they make."

Do you know how sick and E Coli infection can make you? Sodomy is akin to having sex in raw sewage."
408,notsarc,Stop trying to muddy the waters. I was talking about developed nations with lower murder rates.

I cannot hope to summarize what this is all about, please refer to:   Philosophical Critiques: The Human Person - 3   One could also consider the social development of an infant, inasmuch as humans are, in most cases, very social animals.   According to primatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, the human species is specifically developed to be part of a social system and a newborn infant comes ready made to push all the buttons of the system:"

412,notsarc,"What a condescending attitude you have. In case you haven't noticed, you are a very small part of the human race that you smuggly hold in contempt. (Thankfully small!) Your mission should be to improve it, not to stand back and claim you are better than everybody else, as you seem to do.   Killing innocent people of any age is wrong. Children are no exception, they are just the epitomy of innocence.   The ""pretty sick"" applies to your own deluded thoughts.   Rest assured, I will not mourn your death or the deaths of any of those you may have taught your insane values. You are  !"

414,notsarc,Can't say.
415,notsarc,"Well, that just means I'm a more capable lump of cells now than I was when I was first conceived. I started doing what most embryos do when they are first formed, and that is develop. I'm still developing. I can't seem to stop it. I think my body has stopped growing (in height anyway), but seem to keep filling my brain with more and more experience.   The point I was trying to make is that since there is a continuum of existence between conception and death, there is no line you can draw (save birth, which may or may not be considered an arbitrary boundary to personhood) that would constitute some sort of a change in what you are.   I started as one cell and continued to grow and develop, which I am still doing now. If I am a person now, I was a person when I was the zygote.   If we are going to talk about aortion in this society we should be honest about it and not try to mince words when it come to killing a baby. I'm not ""anti-choice"" but I think we should honestly recognize that an embryo is a living human individual that dies when it is aborted. That thought turns most people off so they have to make themselves believe that an abortion is not a killing since the embryo wasn't a person. Logically, it is a killing. A life was ended. The question then becomes, is it murder? I don't happen to think that, but it is really quite subjective anyway."
416,notsarc,"You believe two things that are incorrect: that you have refuted evolutionary theory, and that we will now accept intellegent design because of your attempt."

418,notsarc,"I think I, and the other members of what I'll call the ""scientific community"", must be masochists of sorts as well, we continually return to these threads and bang our heads against minds that are stone walls - completely impervious to reason or logic.   I think, no, I know, that there are two main reasons why I return to these threads. The first one is simple, I'm amazed at the scientific illiteracy of the average YEC, especially when science is often their justification for belief.   The second and major reason is simply my fascination with how the mind of the Creationist works. Their desperation to justify their faith is so powerful it drives them to completely abandon mainstream science and logic in favour of an isolated coccoon of reality. The insecurity in their faith that the entire pseudoscience of creationism betrays is the most ironic part.   As you say, most quickly realize that they're in over their heads, that what they've been told in their churches doesn't stand up to scrutiny in the real world. So, rather than continuing down a path that will bring them no good, they retreat and bury their heads in the comforting sand of ""not knowing any better"". However, there always seems to be one or two that are so deeply entrenched, that they simply can't retreat, they've got too much invested.   The psychology, more than the science, is fascinating to me.   Waxy"

420,notsarc,"Nope. Not part of evolutionary theory. It would be stupid to claim that increased genetic variability would ""disallow"" any portion of the population from breeding."
421,notsarc,"Sorry, sometimes sarcasm is quite hard to read."
422,notsarc,"1. From what I have learned, different locations breed different surroundings. Human ancestors were migratory pack animals. Where they went, they encountered new types of pressures, causing them to change over time.   2. Different selective pressures. Different areas can lead to different pressures. Some mutations also occured etc. Things like that.   Evolution doesn't HAVE to occure non-stop if there is equilibrium. Not everyting is always changing, as far as I learned. Barring mutations that cause significant changes over a lot of time, Apes, Chimps, Monkies wouldn't really change all that much. There's no real pressure to do so. They are already well-adapted to their surroundings.   Actually however, there really isn't that much difference between some of the great apes and Humans. Take the Bonobo Chimps, for example. They have 98% the same DNA as Humans. They are the closest to HOmo Sapien.   3. Niches. Related to above. Crocs, for example, don't evolve that much because they are a very successful animal design and they found a place in which they can thrive for generations with little to no changes. Other animals can do the same.   4. As well, humans didn't come directly from Apes. We all evolved from a common ancestor who did all of the above.   http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/species.html   Here is a time line of hominid species   http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-speciation.html   http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/speciation.html   Evolution doesn't lead to a higher species, as well. There is no hierarchy in nature. Each species is equally as well ""evolved"" depending on it's environment etc.   A Human is no more evolved than a Chimp or better than a Chimp. Evolution doesn't lead to progression, but merely change. It's not getting better toward some high standard. Humans just like to think so."
423,notsarc,"You are correct, but contingency must be in place to deal with it when it occurs.   Look at what happened in Eire with ""Case X"" in 1992- what happens when a country with the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe has to face up to the issue of pregnacy as a consequence of rape:   http://www.prochoiceforum.org.uk/ireland6.asp   Pages 12-13 of this EU report (Adobe Acrobat reader required):   http://www.newr.bham.ac.uk/pdfs/Repr...m%20Bremen.pdf"

425,notsarc,"I know this is an old posting, but I thought I would add to it. I have built several 1911 clones. Press forge the frame (and slide, sometimes), then mill the parts. I use a CNC mill (about $750,000). A lot fo guys, though, use a $300 minimill from harbor freight. A setup for press forging the parts (press forging is the better modern alternative to drop forging) will set you back less than $200, if you are a good scrounger.   Gun building is probably a more common hobby than you might think. It is hard to tell exactly how many people are doing it, because a homebuilt gun requires no registration, permit to build, or any of that other XXXX (unless you are building an NFA firearm, which is a machine gun). There is even a yahoo group about building your own gun. Fro the faint of heart (those who don't want to forge or cast theri own reciver/frame) there are a bunch of places that will sell you an 80% finished reciever, which doesn't count as a firearm from a legal viewpoint.   I always buy my barrels since it is too much work to do the rifling. In a pinch, it could be done, it just wouldn't be a competition grade barrel. Of course, most firearms you buy don't come with a stock competition grade barrel."
426,notsarc,"The purposeful taking of life regulated by the government is something that is decided by the people. The people decide what determines what is allowable and what is not. When it is acceptable and when it is not. This is done in agreement, obviously not unanimous. Theses laws are created by the view of society at the time. Our society permits the ability to change those laws as our values change.   You may call it murder, but you are wrong. There is no logical argument you can present to make your view correct. To suggest that legal abortion is anything else is an expression of your frustration why others don't share your views. There is no logic in your argument it's pure emotion and an immature understanding of how to cope with problems that don't go your way.   If you think your view is indeed the view that is best for the people then be thankful in the US the opportunity exists for you to effect that. I can assure you though lieing about it, sensationalizing it, bullying people about it isn't going to get many people to consider you.   Please do us both a favor before you go off on a discourse of the rights, or feelings or value of the fetus remember what I said about we as a society decided what is acceptable and what is not. We make these laws for ourselves for that reason, because we do attempt to value life. That attempt does not always satisfy all of the people all of the time, but it never will.   I don't need a formula to understand how our society functions nor do I stomp my foot and throw insults or intimidate people who don't see you being right. Nor would I justify behavior that from anybody else concerning something of less import would be unacceptable. If you don't like the law, then do something about it. If this is what you deem to be the best and most effective way to do that, I suggest you find a to become comfortable with it."

434,notsarc,and a quote from jitobear:
435,notsarc,"Because feeling safe isn't the same as being safe.   The people on the airplanes of September 11th felt safe just before the terrorists took over. The Virginia Tech victims felt safe before they knew about the killer that managed to slaughter 32 innocents. Everyone involved in any major massacre has always had plenty of reason to feel safe right up until the killings took place. But the fact remains that none of them were safe. If they were safe then they wouldn't have gotten killed.   Feeling safe is nothing more than a false sense of security that can be destroyed at any given moment. I'd rather not be a victim of some violent incident and mistakenly believe that it could never happen to me.   I'd rather actually being safe as opposed to just feeling safe. Feeling safe is just that: just a feeling, it's not anything tangible, it's not something that will do you any good if somebody decides that you're going to be their next target."
436,notsarc,"State-level governments are largely worthless, in my opinion. It is complete absurdity to allow Constitutions to be ammended based on the vote of the people. People as a whole are largely biased, uninformed, and care only about the wellbeing of the majority, persecuting the minority any chance they get. Simply put, the will of the people is too often to benefit the majority and persecute the minority, and this can be seen everywhere throughout history. The will of the people often deserves to be not only ignored but put in a little can and crushed, for the voice of the people is not the voice of the people at all; it is the voice of the majority.   I cannot know the intentions of the creators of the California goverment when they created their judicial system, but if it was anything like the intentions of the founders of our nation, then the judges are doing precisely what it was intended to do: judge laws which persecute the minority, assuring that the government cannot engage in such persecution without a whole lot of effort and not having to fear retaliation. If the point of judges was simply to give in to whatever pesecution 51% of the population wishes to force upon the other 49%, then our government would be tyrannical in no time.   You may feel that a bad precedent was set, but I consider it a far worse precedent for a judge to have given into the majority, to ignore what he feels is a destruction of freedom and equality, simply because it is popular to do so. I would also recommend that the California Constitution be judged based on the fact that it likely has conflicting statements, for example, it may state that everyone must recieve equal protection under the law, of which this is a clear denial.   The California judge would probably not have the authority to refer to the Federal Constitution; it would have to be taken to the Federal Courts for that."

It has also been tested on items for which the age is known through historical records, such as parts of the Dead Sea scrolls and some wood from an Egyptian tomb (MNSU n.d.; Watson 2001). Multiple samples from a single object have been dated independently, yielding consistent results. Radiocarbon dating is also concordant with other dating techniques (e.g., Bard et al. 1990)."

462,notsarc,"If we were created in God's image, then it would make sense that equally our emotions are a reflection of God's emotions. That our emotions are imperfect versions of his.   Of course I would personally say that when man invented god, they felt the need to give him human characteristics in order to make their invention more understandable. And to assist in the oppression of others by the ever-present threat of an 'angry god who will smite you'. An 'ambivalent god who is above that sort of thing' just isn't as good at convincing people that whatever you say is right."

Religion has been used to push extreme political viewpoints, selfishness, racism, destruction of whole cultures, hatred, and ignorance. Wow that's something for you to be proud of eh grizzly6626? Through religion, televangelists have become pimps where cash is more important than integrity. While I haven't seen any atheists with bombs strapped to themselves, we've all see plenty of religious fools blowing themselves up each and every day.

470,notsarc,"The quad 50 full automatic anti-aircraft gun is designed to oscillate on it's mount. This is so that the bullets will come out in a pattern. This pattern along with tracer rounds helps the shooter guide the blizzard of bullets at the aircraft. Even this only works at low altitudes. Modern planes typically fly at ~30K feet. That's more than 5 miles high! A perfect bullet, or one that is fired in a vaccum with an initial velocity of 2800 fps will only go ~25k feet before gravity alone will have reduced it's velocity to 0 fps. The odds of hitting something that is moving at ~900 fps at any distance with a bullet traveling at ~2800fps are slim to none. That is why anti-aircraft guns are full auto, not a semiauto or anything that a citizen has access to legally."
471,notsarc,"Yeah, back in the Late 60, because The Black Panther Party was publicly armed, and had publicly advocated Offing the Pigs, our law makers granted the police the law that said it was illegal for anyone to transport any firearm within Ohio. They did it with the understanding that they would not abuse the privilege that was granted for their protection. Well, 40 years went by, and new officers seeing this law on the books started enforcing it. After all, why not, It is the law, and their is no excuse for the law! Period!   Well, Ohioans for Concealed Carry and a bunch of others, decided enough was enough, and contacted Ohio law makers who took it off the books because it wasn't being used, as agreed upon!"

477,notsarc,"But your proof didn't claim that God could do anything possible. Maybe only one person could build a computer, maybe one person could make a car, maybe one person could run the mile in under 4 minutes. That doesn't mean that God can do ALL of these things. It means that whoever we define to be the greatest being, we can call him god and thus he exists. Of course this wouldn't be sufficient to Christians as this says that God is probably mortal and has the limits of being a physical being."

Rather than go with the slightly bizarre 'well you're not King David are you...' type response, I could see it being fairly reasonable that God 'knows' people who are born. He might 'know of' the various individuals who are misscarried, die at birth or are aborted but what exactly does he know in relation to them?   Do our souls have their own personalities completely seperate from our mortal ones that are shaped as much by our souls as genes and experience - or does God 'know' them through the billions of other possible universes, i.e he knows them from somewhere/when they didn't die. But if that counts then that means our souls are spread out over an infinite number of copies of us. If so then surely the threat of Hell is irrelevant, either we are doomed because clearly some version of reality has us being evil (I've seen enough TV shows to know that this is pratically 100% certain.) or the soul is something seperate from us and our actions?"
482,notsarc,"So would you care if abortion were outlawed. If so, what would be bad about allowing a view that places objective value in human life to be the basis for making law?"
483,notsarc,"So let me get this straight - you admit that you are wrong, and you want me to provide documentation to prove this admission correct?   How about we both simply agree that you were wrong and move on."

Science will never be able to disprove any god because of some flaw science happens to point out. The best individuals can do is, when people try to reason that such perfect organs imply a designer, point out that the design isn't all that perfect after all.   If you want to try and debate flaws in design are evidence against a god... well go ahead... but then i'll just know if i'm ever looking for an easy debate victory i'll just try to find you. At the very best all you are doing is showing that the idea that God created all things perfectly probably isn't true... and even then someone can just point out that apparent flaws we see are simply the ineffable will of god."

491,notsarc,I disagree for the same reasons I have been giving all along. There may be some legislation that was passed that has kept corporations small (Anti-trust) but did it really benefit the society?
492,notsarc,And the answer is: we don't know. Maybe it came from nowhere. Maybe it was created. We don't know.
493,notsarc,"I'll have to apologize here, SoC. I confused you with another poster who also used Christ in his handle. You didn't run from the topic because you weren't the OP of that thread. Sorry about that.   If you'd still like to approach that thread, I'll respond and provide the link, but all readers should be clear that my accusation that SoC scampered away was mistaken, and any willingness to address the arguments would be solely to SoC's credit."
494,notsarc,"Different sort of penetration, so no."
495,notsarc,"Actually, evolution occurs on the level of the population: individuals don't change, but populations do. See the examples above."
496,notsarc,"Because the Iliad and Odyssey do not claim to be divine does not mean they should be placed under a different threshold as the Bible. Otherwise, it's special pleading on your part, and thus logically fallacious.   This is one of many inconsistencies between skeptics in regards to the scrutiny of the Bible. They are unwilling to put the standards they have on the Bible against other books similar in age. If they did, there would not be a single book left standing."
497,notsarc,"I don't have the time nor the funding to put this in video form like Harris and Dawkins. I don't think many, if any, Christians really do - satire about atheism isn't a strong Christian practice, not nearly as strong as atheist satire about Christianity, it seems. Maybe that's what made Poe's Law so notable in the beginning of this thread."
498,notsarc,Not heard that before! made me laugh almost as much as your lettuce eating Tyrannosaur
499,notsarc,"So you're saying that the theory of evolution is similar to ####, in that they both make large messes when they come into contact with fans?"
500,notsarc,"again, please review the definition of an atheist   humor cannot be observed by apparatus that test the physical realm. it is an abstract and intangible quality. so is beauty, artistic ability and pleasure. yet these things exist and are as real to an atheist as it is to a theist. an atheist does not need a devine revelation to appreciate intangible qualities or account for their existence. they can be detected through mental processing, and communicated so that others can agree on the quality and identify it when it is present.   being an atheist does not preclude belief in the existence of intangible and abstract things. it just precludes the belief in god and a spiritual/supernatural realm"
501,notsarc,"It is worse then that they just don't get it. Once you put some civil rights on the ballot nothing is off limits. Freedom of speech, religion, assembly ect.. they are all up to be voted out of existence for an unpopular minority by the majority. They just don't get it."

503,notsarc,Another oft-repeated lie.

505,notsarc,"Like the docking simulation, in development there is a pre-existing fitness landscape (the womb). Both processes converge on similar endpoints each time it is run, both process are biased to a few endpoints and both processes reach local optima (e.g. skin cells) after the process id complete.   http://mybroadband.co.za/vb/picture....pictureid=1857   Figure 1: Similarities between development and a docking simulation employing a memetic algorithm.   There are certainly many parallels between our own designed simulated docking runs and the development of life."
506,notsarc,No. You've not understood what I said. I don't know how to make it perfectly clear to you...the reason the skin color vs. homosexuality analogy is not valid is that one is in 100% of the cases studied a result of uncontrollable genetic inheritance and the other is generally not.
507,notsarc,"Just on my way out, saw this, and YES! I have long believed that this is the heart of the matter, and have tried to make this point with little success from time to time.   I have never seen a direct response to this. Ever. Even in threads where the discussion has carried on in detail on both sides, this concept is totally ignored.   There was a similar, brief hiatus leaning towards this point in one of the threads over at IIDB where creationist spammer Afdave is rapidly losing his dignity and proving himself predictably ignorant in all fields of science including the philosophy of same.   It got really interesting for a bit and the guys over there looked to have actually got through to him for a bit, but then he predictably went into full Gish Gallop mode in order to bury his own cognitive dissonances underneath wave upon wave of standard AiG/EvoFairytale strawmen.   Just my two pence; this is a fascinating psychological point that should be discussed."
508,notsarc,"So, you would vote to legislate against it? Ok, now that thats cleared up, why do you consider sex to be so bad? Sex is a healthy part of a relationship or marrige, and i would not go to these lengths to minimize it. Sex has a small risk of ending in pregnancy, and an even smaller risk if using a condom, and even smaller than that if the woman uses a contraceptive. Then, if EVERYTHING fails, there would be abortion in the extreme circumstances that it does result in a pregnancy. I doubt that criminalized abortion will reduce sex. It will only cause suffering and fear for women.   I thought we were out of the dark ages already."
509,notsarc,"I think your idea has merit. However, before I would fully endorse it, I am interested in how you see it being implemented and administered from the standpoint of equal protection under the law."

513,notsarc,"You either did not read my post thoroughly, or are intentional misrepresenting me. Post 250 (which I had actually read before starting this thread) is nothing but DamEtel rambling about homologies between vertebrae embryos. That has absolutely nothing to do with the unexplained homologies that the Denton talks about. Evolution simply cannot, reasonably speaking, account for the homology between your arm and leg, among other examples."

516,notsarc,"The Sun was crucial in the evolution of most life on the planet, but it may not have been the main cause of the very beginning of life. There are hypotheses that energy necessary, chemical catalysts available, Carbon, Nitrogen, Hydrogen, but not Oxygen apart from being part of the Water molecule. There are tectonic activated hot springs and chimneys in the deep sea. There is an availability of Sulfur, heat energy, and the triggering of a Sulphur based metabolism. It was internal energy from up welling and down welling of hot magma which in turn was fuelled by core radioactivity. Some even speculate that the very centre of the core may be pure Uranium.   However, there is no need to debate the Second Law of Thermodynamics. It is a ruse by Magical Creationists who deliberately and in my opinion deceptively make Earth a closed entropy system.   Cuchulainn   PS: Fundies have an obligation to show why the fires of Hell are exempt from the 2nd Law. I already know the answer. Hell is imaginary and imaginary things do not gain entropy."
517,notsarc,"They aren't afraid of that. That a government agency would actually be financially competitive is ridiculous.   The only way it could compete for customers would be by running at an enormous loss or legislating away competition.

522,notsarc,"Actually, it's not conjecture. The genetic makeup of the several subspecies of arctic foxes bear it out. The dominant allele is rare because it is less adaptive. The dominant allele is most likely ancestral. But even foxes below the Arctic circle show differences in their fur between summer and winter. So yes, foxes that were able to change color in the north had a differential reproductive advantage over those who couldn't."

524,notsarc,"I think you fail to take into account that for most opposers of abortion, they genuinely feel they are trying to save lives by their opposition. In many cases it's not a matter of trying control sexual prermissiveness in society but preventing lives from being killed. Disagree or not, you can't separate the anti-abortion message from the fact that it holds to the view that abortion is a form of murder."

529,notsarc,"So a free society is one where the goverment does not have tabs on their citizens? How could then the goverment work when it does not know who they actually govern? The foundation of economics is that you have correct data, else it´s the beginning of corruption not freedom.   And since when was there a dichotomy between freedom and socialism?   Further how does the usage of identification ease the rounding up of suspects?

537,notsarc,"Oh, don't be so hasty Bear in mind that at the scale upon which bacteria operate, molecules are significant physical structures. The bacterial flagellum, for instance, is an outboard motor constructed directly out of proteins, which are in turn directly, physically translated via RNA from DNA sequences. The physical shape of the folded molecular structure of those proteins is what makes the motor work. So there's nothing abstract about the relationship between DNA and the organism's physical form or abilities."
538,notsarc,"Obviously not. If the right to life trumps all other rights, then it follows that the mother's right to life and the child's right to life cancel each other out.   Mind you, if it's her choice then the pro-life movement endorses such heroism, right?"

It is interesting to note that creationist computer software developers/programmers cannot seem to agree on the implications of 'mutations' when using such analogies - one such person, C.K. Lester, declared that computer programs can accumulate up to 30% 'random change', just like DNA (hypothetically) can, therefore, the computer analogy is a good one. But programmer R. David Pogge declares that even a single altered bit in a line of computer code a million bits in length would destroy it."

An agnostic, or atheist teaching establishment can become satisfied with one path of scientific theories without searching for others. There may be more to be discovered about thermodynamics, cell structure, irreducible complexity, the decay rate of the earth's magnetic field, radiometric dating, the fossil record, and countless other things that a teaching establishment may not be interested in exploring, if it's comfortable with it's interpretation of current data's indications that the happenstance origins worldview is correct.

And your anaysis of the FL situation is completely removed from reality. FL requires a vote of over 60% for an amendment to pass. It wouldn't pass at 59%, let alone 50.

559,notsarc,"First, are you not forcing your beliefs on me when you lobby for, enact, and support a law that legalizes an act that I see as murder?   Second, forcing someone to believe as I do is in no way the essence of Christianity. God gives choices (which is another debate) to man. We must simply choose right or wrong. Jesus wants us to influence, not force. Jesus said to His followers in Matthew 5:14-16, ""You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven."" If I truly believe in Jesus as my Lord and Saviour (and I do), then I must follow His command to influence (not force) the whole world. It doesn't do any good to only preach to the preached."

Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.   You've rewritten Biblical Christianity. 2 Timothy 4:3-4 (New International Version) - For the time will come when they will not put up with sound doctrine.

Although, this article was of course written after the coelocanths were re-discovered.

Sorry, I know you're looking for more substantial personal feedback, but this is some good basic information that doesn't rely upon a billion links.   You also might consider asking this question on iidb.org, and maybe Dr. Meert will respond to you personally.   More importantly, let us not get hung up on analyzing the raw empirical data only. For example, if I use a stopwatch to time how long it takes for light to flood the room after I turn on the switch, and I come up with 0.06s, you can't argue with my empirical data: I timed it at 0.06s. The fact that human response time is comparatively lousy and that a stopwatch is awful for extremely short time intervals is more significant that the stopwatch reading itself.

There's no point in writing an argument, summarising it and then leaving the thread before I've had a chance to respond to even your argument (never mind your summary). If you are going to simply ignore any criticisms of your reasoning, then I struggle to see the point of you repeatedly requesting a one-on-one debate in the first place - you essentially regress your argument to the 'because I said so' that you are (presumably) hoping to avoid, it's just that there's slightly more detail."

Your house of cards is built on a rhetorical slight of hand, trying to persuade by implying somehow that abortion being legal, which it is, in the U.S., right now, should not be allowed.   TIP: Trying forming a reasoned argument without such a weak premise, else, your entire argument is just as flawed, which it is.   Abortion is legal, for the right reasons.   A conscious, human, U.S. citizen, has rights.   Cells, without consciousnes, that are not citizens, do not have rights, are not individuals, and are not humans.

588,notsarc,"In other words, you think a Supreme Court decision should only shut down the debate if it's a decision you agree with. Roe v. Wade and Heller do share some striking similarities. For example, Scalia stated in Heller:   ""Nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on long-standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.""   However, the text of the Constitution has as much to say about such restrictions as it does about abortion. I've heard that Scalia has been criticized for making such a statement because there is no clear historical precedent dating back 200 years of banning felons from owning firearms. So neither the text of the Second Amendment nor tradition justifies such restrictions. It is an example of judicial lawmaking."
589,notsarc,"First of all. Excuse me for my english writing-skills.   Being a Norwegian citizen with free universal healthcare, it is pretty hard to understand why many of you Americans are so afraid of a little more govermental influence in the healtcare-business. Everybody knows that healthcare costs money. So why accept that a large ammount of your money is going right in the pockets of the insurancecompanies? Shouldn´t your money result in healthcare and not in profit for some greedy company?   To be honest I´m happy to be Norwegian instead of American.   When I get sick I can go to any hospital and get the best treatment available without having to worry about the costs. What´s wrong with that guys? Of course it comes at a price. We probably pay higher taxes than you. But I do not pay for insurance, and bottom line I think most people are better off this way. At least I´m getting healthcare for my money without supporting insurancecompanies that makes a profit out of peoples health-issues.   Any comments?"
590,notsarc,"The 2020 Global Food Outlook answers this as it says that a greater demand for vegetables will correspond with higher prices of vegetables in developing countries. Many articles acknowledge that starving people cannot afford much of any of the food for sale around them, and a greater demand for meat does not necesarily mean a decrease in demand for vegetables as populations grow globally. Since increasing meat consumption is irrational because it will not feed the poor and it will do even more damage to the environment, again, the solution proposed is to support the initiative for developing nations to become more self-sufficient in growing plant foods for themselves."
591,notsarc,"Yes, I believe there will be a lot more to come (as you said, just look at the ""hobbits"" that were recently discovered). I love this sort of look into the migrations of everyone over the last 160,000 years or so."
592,notsarc,"Oh, he doesn't want abortion, huh? If you take the Old Testament to be true, you just lied here.   Let's look, shall we?"
593,notsarc,"Hmm . . . funny, I don't remember ever hearing a pro-lifer say that pregnancy was a wonderful snuggly thing or the best thing in the world. What I do see is pro-lifers like myself wondering why pregnancy is protrayed (in the form of a generalization) as so horrible by people such as yourself who just described it as ""unbelievably"" hard to go through, or a ""life threatening condition"" like malignant cancer. You didn't qualify it by saying ""some"" pregnancies are life threatening or unbearable. Maybe yours was, but how can you say that for every woman in the world? I know for a fact that my wife's pregnancy was not ""unbelievably hard to go through""--she's told me otherwise and I believe her. Sorry, but I believe my wife over you.   What you did was use unfounded generalizations, which is exactly the sort of thing this thread is about."
594,notsarc,"""refuted?""   O'rly?   First they start off defining evolution as ""moleclues to man"" despite what evolution actually states. That further proves my point about strawman. They don't discuss what evolution actually is. Furthermore, the whole notion that increasing capacity and adaption is not increasing complexity is insane. If I take a simple structure, modify it to form something more complex, is that not a change in complexity? The whole idea that modifying DNA, changing it, removing and adding isn't actually changing anything is retarded.   And they are separating macro from micro. That's an invalid argument given that macro is nothing more then the aggregate of micro. A billion tiny changes makes a few large ones.   The second idiotic article cites Natural genetic engineering. Despite there being absolutely no evidence of this occuring anywhere."
595,notsarc,"I believe that the vast majority of people, if they are well-informed about responsible sexuality, have access to contraception, and are of reasonably sound mind, would much prefer not to experience an abortion and would take precautions to avoid such a possibility.   It is rather tiresome to hear careless and irresponsible talk of whorish women who seek to become pregnant solely so that they may exercise their right to an abortion.   I have never met such a woman. To be sure, there are unbalanced individuals who are riddled with guilt over sexuality and these individuals are incapable of being sexually responsible. I don't associate with such people and since I have never encountered such a person, I must believe that this sort of person comprises a very small minority.   But with the amount of bluster and piffle to the contrary, I must wonder whether or not such blusterers have any connection at all to what really is."
596,notsarc,"yes, but adam wasnt created with hereditary information or from sperm and egg cells. adam was the prototype. any subsequent humans should be born following the fashion in which adam was made. otherwise adam could have been shaped like a goat and still bear human children, because god could have formed him into whatever shape or lack of shape he wanted, yet put the genetic information in him to produce human offspring. why should adam's children look like adam? wouldnt adam's children be born the way adam was created, or not?"
597,notsarc,"To each his own...if you got it - flaunt it. Think of all the pretty, fashionable gun rigs that would spawn. Darn sinjin, you might have to get an outfit to get a date Course if you carried concealed like say, Mike Hammer, you might have to get a bowler or little CS hat?   Think of all the jobs it would create. Leather workers. Engravers. Gun finishes. More stylish guns. Corner gun stores and ammo at the local grocery, mail order business and on and on and on.   ""Posers""? That is about all there is in kalifornia now isn't it? It doesn't bother you to watch scantily clad women...or men, whatever your preference is; why would full free exercise of a right freely stated in the Constitution be any different?   Oh, and on topic, end the pathetic pleas of the brady cowards and howls from VPC calling for discrimination and getting sued for demanding a Starbucks or any other emporium banish a citizen exercising a right."
598,notsarc,"Well, HRC estimates that the costs would be negligable and that some governments would actually save money. They site many studies on the issue, which I have not taken the time to look up, as I think this sort of statistic is worthless. It is unreasonable to ask same-sex couples to pay for the marriage of opposite-sex couples without asking opposite-sex couples to return this payment. Still, you seem very concerned about it, so I will provide this link:   http://www.hrc.org/Template.cfm?Sect...entDisplay.cfm   It is an interest group in favor of gay rights, yes, but that doesn't make them wrong. I did have a link to an actual study on the topic, but I cannot seem to find it. I'm sure if I scoured the Internet more, I could come up with something."
599,notsarc,"But poetry will never be taken seriously in political decisions. Atheists have a lot to like in songofgenesis, don't they?   another quote"
600,notsarc,"You're thinking is right on, sinjin.   Although it's kinda hush-hush, it has been determined (especially in the more charismatic churches) that when one ""goes further"" in religion the other feels alienated and problems/troubles that probably would have never risen in their relationship oozes out. A new circle of friends emerge which make the one that is &#8220;left behind&#8221; feel closed out and closed off. Arguments then seem to erupt daily and most of it over who is doing the &#8220;right thing&#8221; according to that religion, followed all too often by divorce."
601,notsarc,If guns laws don't affect criminals then how do you explain the low rates of criminal gun use in nations like the UK?
602,notsarc,"Well, actually society has said that 18 is the dividing line. It can then also say, that under certain circumstances, for a particularly bad person, in some cases it will be considered if the person is 16 or 17. That's why we have all the judges and lawyers, etc..."
603,notsarc,"A soul has a consciences, it can be emotionally moved from different states of being. This is how the Bible can say ones soul is moved; saddened; joyous. Etc.   I think therefore I am. Meaning a soul is emotional and so it really has no body. The soul is what we ask the Lord to preserve.   1Peter 1[9] Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.   Hamburger does not have a soul, it is dead meat. People eat brains and all the pieces of an animal. No soul. The soul is consciences. Under some conditions it can return, not after death or before a brain though. We know that to be impossible. Fetuses do not get emotional; there is no mind to speak of. No soul there to trouble.   If you?re on a machine and a doctor determines your brain is dead, the soul is not there. The body could see hell or heaven and there is no emotional effect. No soul for that.   Read the Bible. Don?t listen to fools; you?re a person with a soul. Use it."
604,notsarc,"Well said.   With this religion, the gap is very wide between the ""average guy"" and ""authority"", because their clergy is more involved in politics than the clergy of Christianity, or the Creator himself. It fits with more Democrats being evolutionists, and more Democrats favoring bigger domestic government."
605,notsarc,"i'm impressed! this is a very precise description, in regular english   and yes, the deduction in 9 seems presumptious if all we state is God has a ""possibility of existence"". how this was cleverly cleared up (from the same source site) was simply a trip back to the definition: ""greatest possible being"". the ""greatest possible being"", by definition, MUST have a possible existence. in otherwords, we cannot assume that there is a possibility that the greatest possible being does not exist. yeah, it sounds like the whole ""proof"" is pointless because your premise is already the proof   just keep in mind that for the purposes of this proof, God is defined as ""the greatest being possible"". as long as that definition is maintained, the proof works...   does that mean that God exists? hmmm...."
606,notsarc,"You SERIOUSLY need to take a basic biology course so you can stop sticking your foot in your mouth   An egg is NOT larva, and larva is NOT a caterpillar, and a caterpillar is NOT a butterfly - much the same as a zygote is NOT a embryo, and a embryo is NOT a fetus, and a fetus is NOT a baby, and a baby is NOT an adult.   I challenge you to prove that a larva is exactly the same as a butterfly. If you can't even do something as simple as that, then you'll never understand the process/transformation of what a human has to go through, and THAT in and of itself should give you a clue as to how much in denial you are in, and how much you have to twist the truth around just to justify your version of events. Deal with it!"
607,notsarc,But the point is why are there relatively few creationists. The reason is that the creationist position cannot be defended in open debate. That is why creationist boards censor opposing views. On boards where creationists are not protected there are few.
608,notsarc,"Well, I have heard people on the pro-gun side say that most defensive gun uses don't involve firing even one round. So limiting the capacity would probably have less of an effect on the ability to defend yourself than on crime. So why are people from the gun lobby always whining about restrictions like this? When semi-automatic rifles were banned in Australia, hunters welcomed the law. They saw it as a challenge because it takes greater skill to shoot an animal with a bolt action rifle. Not so in America where some gun owners like to use guns that could take down planes to shoot small animals."
609,notsarc,"This joke is based on some reality, ""the conquest of the North Pole is traditionally credited to Anglo-American Navy engineer Robert Edwin Peary, who claimed to have reached the Pole on April 6, 1909.   Anyhow, not all jokes are completely true, how many stand up comedians have you heard??? If you were to nit pick every joke out there (being politicaly correct etc) there would be no jokes left!"
610,notsarc,Because it shows that Ockham was arguing against what Hi_Its_Me says the Razor is.
611,notsarc,"I'd say no to the first part, and yes to the second. The ""information theory"" argument is something that gets brought up on forums alot, generally by people who don't know what information theory is, but I've never seen an ""official"" ID person claim it as a central argument.   The basic argument is that stuff, from the universe, to people, to eyeballs, to DNA, is too complex to have ""just happened"". Someone, (and they won't say God, cause their not trying to be religious here, oh no...) must have designed them."

613,notsarc,"Not if they give him the death penalty, then it's apeals till your ears bleed."
614,notsarc,"Problem is, you think requiring a woman not to kill someone is ""treating them as breeding animals"". Kind of an odd thought."
615,notsarc,"So he failed to follow procedure? So was one of the procedures to assist the child in holding the gun while the gun was being fired and to not stand at a distance? If that's the case then the instructor at the firing range was also partially at fault because it was also his responsibility to supervise the child. And I just found this:   ""SPRINGFIELD, Mass. - Authorities in Massachusetts are considering whether criminal charges should be filed in the death of an eight-year-old boy who accidentally shot himself with an Uzi submachine-gun at a gun show.   ""Hampden County District Attorney William Bennett says he hasn't been able to find any law that would authorize a child to possess or fire a machine-gun.""   Criminal charges possible in boy's Uzi death, Massachusetts authorities say - Yahoo! Canada News   So not only is allowing children to fire machines guns irresponsible it may also be illegal."
616,notsarc,And an even funnier thing is it won't affect his wallet at all.
617,notsarc,"Because you've presented no credible evidence to support the claims that private transactions are an established and major source of firearms for criminals.   If you can't prove it's broken, you don't have grounds to call for fixing it."
618,notsarc,"This is retarded. A species would be defined by the genome, not which organs work the way they are supposed to or not."
619,notsarc,"You know Brady, you've said a lot of stupid stuff over the years. I even remember finding a post of yours where you said all guns and gun owners should be registered, but sex offenders shouldn't be.   This latest post of yours is just another senseless and stupid rambling of somebody that's so hateful and fearful of an inanimate object that it's impossible for him to function in our society and can barely handle his own needs."
620,notsarc,"Because you people keep wanting one restriction after another after another after another. Nothing is ever good enough for you, you always want more than ever. Well we don't want to abide by your wishes, gun ownership is a recognized right, and your hatred of rights won't be tolerated. We're not going to just stand by and be painted as the bad guys because you have the mentally disabled belief that banning gun ownership will reduce crime, and anybody who disagrees with you want to see people killed."
621,notsarc,"Well, to say it has no mental existence doesn't really tell the whole story. The fetus WILL have (more than likely) full mental existence in a very short time. It seems to me that if you ""view humanity with mental existance as important"" you'd also view as important that the unborn baby WILL indeed reach that point, in all likelihood."
622,notsarc,"Because violent crime and violent criminals is something that I can't control. Heart disease, that can be worked on with good diet, exercise and medicine if necessary. It's manageable, controllable and can be avoided. You can't do that with a violent criminal."
623,notsarc,"Why is it when Creo's don't believe something, Evo's always think because they have studies or what have you that we Creo's have to accept it as proof. I mean you don't accept anything as proof from Creo's. If Creo's did some carbon testing and did it accurately and got some anomaly's, you'd still reject it. I didn't lie not even by ignorance. I just don't believe it's true, but I take it I'm not allowed my beliefs . What fact has disproved my worldview, my worldview is intact as it ever has been?"
624,notsarc,"Oh, we don't have to - sorry, I wasn't clear enough there. What I'm trying to do is correct your misapprehensions concerning common descent. You said this:"

628,notsarc,"We can add to this list, Singin's desire of criminalizing gun owners who don't report gun thefts in a required time and to lock up all guns in a manner that will prevent thefts. He of course says that does not mean jail, but aiding and abetting and straw sales already require serious jail time. and straw sales is already a Federal Offense with either 5 or 10 year jail terms. So we are talking about Very Serious jail terms regardless of what Sinjin might say in order to sell the idea. And one more thing the Anti-gun forces want but won't say it now."

642,notsarc,But you can't. You may imagine it but you can't present evidence that supports your position. You can only argue against what you don't understand in the first place. I generally make it a rule to keep my mouth shut unless I have actually had the integrity to educate myself about the basics of a topic. You don't seem to do the same.
643,notsarc,"Why conception? When a mature ovum leaves the ovary, it has every potential of turning into a human being. How dare I stand idly by while that potential life is wasted, unfertilized? No; clearly, it is my duty to try to reach that ovum with my seed. God said to be fruitful and multiply, so I am just following God's will."
644,notsarc,"Actually, that story was an invention after the fact. It never happened. At least that is what the witnesses who were there said. Why do christians feel that it is OK to invent such stories to support their point? Isn't that lying? Isn't lying wrong?"
645,notsarc,"If a child comes in for an abortion and fears abuse from her parents then law enforcement should be notified. The only people protected by opposing notification laws are abusers and pedophiles. No elective, invasive medical proceedure should be performed on a child without the consent of a parent or judge.   If a minor is allowed to have an abortion without consent the parents/ guardians will have no idea whats been done to this child should complications arise, they wouldn't be able to give this information to a ER doctor or the childs pediatrition."

647,notsarc,"Well, now this is the question that really matters, and the answer is a long one. But to state it as simply as possible: denying same-sex marriage hurts many people. It forces same-sex couples to pay for the marriage of opposite-sex couples while no one is forced to pay for their marriages. It denies them access to raise children and ability to cover their children and spouses with their medical insurance, along with the many other benefits of marriage. It uses the law to teach the people that the lifestyle and religion held by same-sex couples is wrong, and this forces them to feel the disapproval of society.   There is no reason to perpetuate these harms. I have heard many arguments opposed to same-sex marriage, but there is not even one of them that justifies these harms. In fact, I would even say that there is not one argument against same-sex marriage that makes logical sense at all. Thus, even if same-sex marriage brought no benefits, there would be no reason to keep it illegal; a free and equal society does not deny rights or benefits to anyone, unless it has a very good reason to. And there just isn't any reason to deny rights and benefits to same-sex couples."
648,notsarc,"And he accomplished all this human carnage without a gun. This just proves that if it was possible to eliminate all projectile firing weapons from existing on earth, men would find a way to commit atrocities against his own kind just as he did before such weapons existed if murder was in his heart. Guns are not the issue, the corrupted heart/nature of humanity is."
649,notsarc,"Maybe you'll have to clear up the difference between ""understanding"" and ""knowing."" I know what I think the difference is, but I need to know what you mean when you say ""I understand that there is definitely no god.""   Personally, I understand that we have no verification one way or another.   All I know is that I don't know one way or the other."
650,notsarc,Because? The conventional big bang is just as unlikely as God. Therefore your claim is wrong.   However the current believe mainly among physicists and astronomers is that there is no end and there is no beginning to the universe. Expansionary theories along with contractionary theories that are being observed have led many to believe that the current universe was born from the death of the last universe. There is no end and there is no beginning.   You are out of your league.
651,notsarc,"I believe that's true, and as a ""believer"" (creationist), here is what is hard to understand about that; In Matthew, 12:30, Jesus says ""He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters"". It is safe to say that both creationists and theistic evolutionists would accept that statement from Jesus, and would seek to be ""with"" him, while agnostic and atheists would consider themselves ""not with"" him. Yet theistic evolutionists are comfortable to (usually politically) be ""with"" agnostics and atheists, and separate themselves from creationists. If they're genuine Christians, knowing about the warnings in the Bible about false teachings, how can they be comfortable with that?   Miller laments in several places throughout the book that atheists use evolution as a weapon against religion, and that it shouldn't be that way - that it causes more strife between the two than should exist."
652,notsarc,"There's absolutely no way in hell this could be legal in any sense. That California school got ***** slapped for expelling a student who had a gun off campus, beyond the jurisdictional reach of the school. So how can this school believe they can get away with such an insane policy?"

666,notsarc,"Really? The first description is of a Hippo? Here's a picture of a Hippo charlie: http://www.dkimages.com/discover/pre...0/90065521.JPG   Now tell me how this fits the description of the behemoths tail? I quote:   Job 40:15-24 (New International Version)   15 ""Look at the behemoth, [a]   which I made along with you   and which feeds on grass like an ox.   16 What strength he has in his loins,   what power in the muscles of his belly!   [b]17 His tail sways like a cedar;   the sinews of his thighs are close-knit.   18 His bones are tubes of bronze,   his limbs like rods of iron.(In Hebrew, this literally reads, “he lets hang his tail like a cedar.”)A Cedar is not a tiny insignificant tree as the hippos tail is when compared to other tails on other animals. You insult the intelligence of the ancients to imply that they couldn't either name or describe a hippo by name which as you yourself admit, was a common animal in that part of the world.   As for Leviathan being a crocodile or an alligator, again, are you telling me that their hides are invulnerable to arrows or spears and cannot be punctured at all? Would those animals stand firm and not flee from men who stood up to them with spears, javelins and arrows? Not on your life.   “Though the sword reaches him, it cannot avail; nor does spear, dart, or javelin. He regards iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood.	The arrow cannot make him flee; slingstones become like stubble to him. Darts are regarded as straw; he laughs at the threat of javelins.”   “On earth there is nothing like him, which is made without fear.”   Leviathan “played” in the “great and wide sea” (a paraphrase of Psalm 104 verses 25 and 26—get the exact sense by reading them yourself).And do you think that the writer who describes this creature is just throwing in the part about smoke, light and fire coming coming forth from its mouth for creative license?   Job 41:18-21   18   By his exhaling a light does shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.   19   Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.   20   Out of his nostrils goes smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.   21   His breath kindles coals, and a flame goes out of his mouth.I fully admit that I am incapable of either explaining or proving what this animal was, but I know it isn't any known animal which currently exists. And Isaiah might have given us the answer as to why this animal no longer exists since we know it was invulnerable to human attacks in the ancient world.Isa 27:1	 In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that [is] in the sea."

I don't understand how I am running over you by living my life openly and wanting the same thing as you the right to consider whom I choose to be my family. If you have an opinion about gay rights thats fine. If you want to deny me the same rights, as you take for granted, because of your opinion and beliefs though laws then that is bigotry."
671,notsarc,"Again with the common sense, but that is another issue alltogether. You're arguement that the brain is a fundamental unit of life is just plain wrong, considering the majority of all organisms don't have one. Bacteria, Protists, Plants, Fungi, and some animals are all without brains. Brains are required for motion and fast response to immediate changes in environment, for example a falling rock. Brains cluster nerves so that appropriate action can be taken. Some brains are amazingly simple while others like our own are immensly complex.   Your arguements all show a general lack of study in biology and my common sense is appalled by yours. I am reminded of Bill Maher who once said about the intelligent design debate: ""Because you don't have to teach both sides of an arguement when one side is retarded."""

They took the politically expedient way out.   Lest you leap to any unwarranted conclusions, my main objection is the blatent inequality inhererent in CUs."
677,notsarc,"I think you present a good point, but part of the test here is to see how my post is reponded to; silence from certain people tells us things in inself.   So far it seems my initial estimation of the issue is about right- the idelogy being upheld helps some people ignore the effect the punitive policy imposes."
678,notsarc,"My recollection is similar to yours. I encountered it in an AP biology class in high school, we spent about 1/2 the extra-long class in labs (I think that was the primary difference).   The giraffe example was an ""aha"" moment for me personally, I suspected life changed, but the specifics I had never thought about.   I recall a disclaimer at the start of the section, but I don't recall the exact wording.   -Mach"
679,notsarc,sinjin - I didn't mean to imply any linkage between your opinions and those of another poster. Apologies.
680,notsarc,So you are saying the US system is better?
681,notsarc,"Actually, I snipped your remarks because 1) you twisted what I said and 2) I'm already spending too much time arguing with random complainers and I was in a hurry to do something more important at the time."
682,notsarc,That is amazing.   I find it crazy that this baby is much younger and smaller and far less developed than many of the babies that are aborted. Abortion is murder.
683,notsarc,Yea I agree with you on how there was no exact se t of laws at the beginning of creation. The reason I say that they most likely didn't marry their sisters is mostly cause God gets mad at Cain and places a mark on his head so everyone he runs across will not kill him unless they want to die a death 10 times worse than his. Kinda just says that there are other people out there.
684,notsarc,"Doesn't it ever bother you that you have to come up with ridiculous hypothetical sci-fi scenarios to attempt to prove your side?   First of all, do you really think a head on life support is going to ""be no different mentally from someone with a body.""? I would say that would probably mess with somebody's head a bit.   Secondly, you sound like you believe this person who is a head on life support deserves equal rights. They are just as helpless as a fetus in the womb. Are you saying it's okay to murder people who can't think and talk? Do you believe that thinking and talking is what qualifies a person for rights?"
685,notsarc,"No, it's not an ""inability"" at all. It's a simple matter of you trying to take what IS a religious issue for many people and divorce it from religion altogether. That's not going to happen for many people.   And BTW, if you are going to refer to people as ""Antis"", at least be upfront about what you feel they are ""anti-"" toward. ""Anti-gay?"" ""Anti-gay marriage?"" What?   But behind that are deeper, more fundamental issues about what homosexuality IS and the morality of it. To many people who view homoseuxality as immoral, your movement seems to be trying to write immorality into law."
686,notsarc,"Actually, after the fact calculations on either side are just noise. Humans do exist and I suspect that all statements of probabilities are incorrect. Further, I don't think that coin flips are relevant and not even a very good analogy."
687,notsarc,The anti-abortionists claim that would be killing a human life to save one.
688,notsarc,"I would kind of Like to Discuss your Fascinating use of Caps.   But seriously, your numbers are insane. Somewhere around 8000 gay couples have gotten married in the past couple of years, how in the world do you imagine that they've cost the state hundreds of thousands or millions each? You just made all that up, didn't you?"
689,notsarc,"The idea here is to demonstrate that the odds of them realizing the same Genesis is impossible. That is unless God came back again, spoke his word into a book through the scribblings of random religious scholars. If you accept that this is inevitable, you are delusional.   The most likely thing would be for humans to come up with an entirely different religious doctrine. I would be willing to bet that it would pass through polytheism into monotheism as more information became available and eventually we would end up right where we are now. The problem with this scenario is that evolution would probably never be confirmed since our biological history would not be apparent. We would come up with theories that God made us and perhaps even some screwballs would say we were all part of an experiment and were placed on the planet by our ancestors a couple hundred thousand years prior."
690,notsarc,Isn't agreeing with what? The senate hasn't passed any laws that would restrict right to carry anymore than it already is.
691,notsarc,Wrong and no one has ever called bone marrow an inner sanctum and I don't know what a baby's tabernacle might be.
692,notsarc,Do you think this resistance got their most useful weapons out of a normal store? Please don´t try such arguments without knowing about European history.
693,notsarc,"You don't consider yourself anymore advanced than animals? Not seperated specially in anyway? If humans are nothing but animals, than you have to question your own views and morals. For if we are just animals, than we have no cause or goals. You may as well kill yourself right now.   Please re-think this idea you have. I understand from your posts that you have a hard emotional problem, and I would urge you to please try and answer yourself those questions. You're views on this issue are built on hate, and annoyance. What morals do you have to support these views other than - You don't like it. -?"
694,notsarc,"Actually, it's not. The big bang theory is also science.   What exactly do you think the big bang theory is? What evidence do you think supports it? What evidence is there against it? why do you disagree? What is your education in cosmology - in other words, why is your disagreement rational?"

""Typically, observable instances of evolution are examples of microevolution; for example, bacterial strains that have become resistant to antibiotics. Because microevolution can be observed directly, both pro-evolution and some anti-evolution groups agree that it is a fact of life."""

707,notsarc,Why are you against abortion?
708,notsarc,"and how do you know this......oh I see...you said ""I think""....but you don't really ""know"" what most Americans favor or don't favor...you just ""think"""
709,notsarc,"But then it also doesn't answer the question ""does anything exist"", nor does it answer an infinite number of ""existence"" questions. Do ""trolls"" exist, follows the same reasoning. If you find one, they are no longer a fairy tale/imaginary creature, they are some organic life form that can be measured, tested, and quantified..i.e. no longer an imaginary creature. So they can no more be found than god.   So replace god/troll with an infinite number of other imaginary things and you'll see why the question ""Does god exist?"", has no real importance in the physical universe.   (does the tooth fairy exist, does a unicorn exist, do flying pigs exist, etc.)   In fact, I like that statement. The existence of god is not imporant...   Rather - the FAITH in god(s, etc.) is what is ""important"", and the thoughts most certainly exist in the physical world and have a measureable impact.   I think that's why I don't mind so much ""religion"" per se, it's the human condition that brings suffering, and uncertainty, into our lives and for some people, the feelings brought about by their faith seems to treat the condition. (the human condition also brings joy, love, etc., but I'd like that without the pain personally)   I only mind it when things in the physical universe are ""attacked"" with the premise of belief in god(s), which is a waste of human energy...we have a limited time, don't spend it using fallacy to undermine those who are actually trying to build on the foundation of human knowledge. And any belief in something without evidence scares me if it becomes a driving force behind decisions.   ...she's a witch because she MADE the crops die...she must be burned.   ...he broke ""god's"" law and therefore must be guilty..   ...this is ""god's"" war..   Yeah, that still scares me. That's why I think, at least in the US, the seperation of church and state is so ridiculously important, and accepted. While there are fundamentalists that rail against it...it's hopefully obvious that with ~80% of the US believing in an imaginary ""god"", but also having a separation of church and state and the most generally advanced scienctific community in the world, then the two can obviously co-exist, and I'd go so far as to say thrive as long as the line is drawn and not crossed.   I learned something in responding, thanks for the spark.   -Mach"
710,notsarc,"If this is what passes for American healthcare, then your need for change is even more desperate. None of these ""treatments"" is available on the NHS."
711,notsarc,"So your only link to gay rights and polygamy is a statement put out by a gay rights conference 30 years ago that does not EXPLAIN a link to polygamy, but shows it's support for it?   Hn ...   I'm with Justine on this one. This is a bit of a stretch.   It would be like me implying that your support for ""traditional marriage"" also supports spousal abuse just because marriages in the past allowed for wife beatings."
712,notsarc,"Well try Arkansas (75/25), Georgia (76/24), Kentucky (75/25), Michigan (59/41), Mississippi (86/14), Montana (67/33), North Dakota (73/27), Ohio (62/38), Oklahoma (76/24), Oregon (57/43), and Utah (66/34).   All of these margins were well above the percentage of votes cast for Bush and Kerry, respectively. Ohio, for instance, went to Bush by 2%, but the ban was passed by 24%. Bush lost Oregon by 4%, but the ban passed by 14%. Bush lost Michigan by 3%, but the ban passed by 18%. The margin of victory for each of these states exceeds George Bush's margin of victory in that state. Those extra votes had to come from somewhere, and it seems like many people other than the ""religious right"" feel the same way."
713,notsarc,"It is in the first place unclear to whom the ""further harm"" is done. But even granting that the fetus dies, it is not clear how the situation is analogous to abortion, because the intentions of not only the man but even more importantly of the pregnant woman are completely different."
714,notsarc,"Well, here is my take on it. I really believe that only the truly evil end up in Hell. Those like Hitler. I think that anyone else goes to heaven - Wiccans, Atheists, Buddhists, etc. - anyone who follows Christ's message of love, tolerance, and acceptance, whether knowingly or not.   Those who preach hate, and those who act on that hate, like Hitler, the KKK, and any other person/persons filled with hate (sad to say, this seems to apply to our own friend Archie here) are the ones who will end up in hell."
715,notsarc,Right. It's called stasis. Species that are well adapted to their environments tend to change little in a stable environment. It is still true that fossil crocs are not the same as modern crocs. There are obvious differences.

717,notsarc,Not true Our laws were originally founded on the precepts of the 10 commandments........
718,notsarc,"Well, man might someday gain the capability of fully synthasizing a molecule as complex as DNA from scratch. Of course, he would use the knowledge gained from studying how various DNA codes affect natural biological characteristics in order to properly design that DNA to achieve the desired characteristics. It might be even more difficult to then take that synthesized DNA and put it in an egg and artificial womb that has no natural (as opposed to artificial) biological parts, but even that might be achievable someday through chemical construction. All this means is that humanity might someday be able to copy the methods of nature to create a new being - perhaps even use creativity to create beings of very different natural functions than we see in our world.   It is all interesting to think about and could well be achievable within this century. We already are capable of a large degree of genetic manipulation through cloning and hybridization. One would think that it will only be a matter of time before more complex technologies get developed.   The other question, of course, is - If we could someday create new life using our technology, should we? That would bring up a whole host of issues, including:   - Would we know what we were doing well enough not to cause great harm?   - How would the beings we create be treated?"
719,notsarc,"And yet quantum physics tends to be very contradictory, at least to our perceptions. Acausal events happen. A particle can be in two places at the same time. A particle can disappear and reappear in a different location without traversing that distance. And et cetera.   Since the beginning of our local universe occurred at quantum levels, I would be cautious about drawing philosophical conclusions based on our macro-world experiences."
720,notsarc,"A slimey claim you cannot support as usual. In developed Nations, the U.S. is far down the list as has been posted on this very board at least 5 times. Those 'other' Nations also have far more crime and violent crime than the U.S."

724,notsarc,"But people start threads here all the time against Christianity regardless of whether someone claims something here about it or not. It's prejudice, pure and simple, and you're no exception. Now, one would think, being the supposedly non-Christian enlightened person you are, you would simply say ""oh, I didn't realize that my posts came across as anti-Christian sometimes, and that it indicates a prejudice on my part, and will try to not have prejudices in my thinking."" I mean, one would think those of you are do this sort of thing would be happy that someone had pointed out the obvious prejudice going on, as it would be a case to help you move away from prejudicial thinking."

732,notsarc,"At 13 - abortion, unless she is uniquely physically advanced. It's incredible how many men are sure being pregnant is no big deal....   Steve - regarding whether she can consent to abortion.   Technically I don't think a minor can consent to either sex or abortion in any state (unless emancipated). I know that is how it is in Minnesota. I am sure the laws vary from state to state.   Medical decisions generally fall to the parents.   I know whether minors should have access to abortion without parental notifications is a controversial issue. On the surface one would think, of course not - but there is concern for those girls who are in abusive situations at home. And as I told VOR, if I had a daughter bound and determined not to tell me, I would rather she have access to safe abortion than resort to something drastic.   A baby pregnant - yikes. Personally I think it's innapropriate and dangerous for a little girl to carry a pregnancy to term. But I would sure love to simply avoid it through better prevention. I do not think an abortion would be anything but scary for her either - but technically, at that age, it would be safer.   Steve - in no way, shape or form is a 13 year old ready for this - not physically, mentally or emotionally - not for pregnancy, and certainly not for parenting. I have a neices that old - good gracious - no way!"
733,notsarc,No. I never mentioned grades. You brought that one up. I'm saying that having guns on school campus isn't a good plan due to the high level of emotions in the area.

736,notsarc,"Largely, out of date. To paraphrase myself from earlier, the differences between 'then' and 'now' are as follows:   Increased availability and proficiency of viable alternatives for self-defence.   Increased availability and improved variety/design of handguns.   Different type of 'gun crime' - it is now largely opportunistic.   Today's government need not fear almost any citizens militia, unless absolutely overwhelming.   Today's government is less in need of a (potential) extra army to defend against foreign assault.   I may have missed some..."
737,notsarc,"But let me guess ... if they step down RIGHT after they find they will have to issue to gay couples, you'd be in favor of them being able to be sued for it, simply because the ""discrimination"" in such an event was toward gays? Right? At least if you are consistent with your stance elsewhere in regards to 'timing' ...   Anyway, aside from that inconsistency with your position elsewhere, I agree that county officials should need to comply. After all, there are probably OTHER examples whereby county officials have to do things that they are religiously against, such as issue divorce papers. Or marry some drunk couple that they know aren't really being serious even though they're tying the knot ... If all county officials could just refuse to do their job because of their objections--for WHATEVER reasons--it would be a collosal mess."

This is the reason you gave for not carrying a firearm, I was simply countering that argument because it didn't sound very logical to me, still doesn't.   As to your new statment, I'll need more info. What do your consider an ""accidental discharge"" of a firearm. I ask because I do not consider someone pulling the trigger to be ""accidental"" and therefore I consider true accidental discharges to be pretty uncommon.   Yes, for most people I think the chances of being in a car accident are greater then the chances of needing a gun for self defense. But, I'm not sure why that would make a difference. If it was reversed I would still where my seatbelt.   God Bless"
747,notsarc,"Rahm Emanuel for one. He seems to sum up the message very well.   And then there's Carolyn McCarthy who actually introduced the bill that, if passed into law, would cancel your Second Amendment rights just because your name is on the no fly list.

749,notsarc,"Actually, if you bothered to pay any attention whatsoever, it actually goes against your point entirely. Just because WSM and I were both in ""heterosexual"" Style relationships, doesn't change the fact that both of us are indeed homosexuals and therefore proves that homosexuals do indeed have children, planned or not.   Mine too was kind of a suprise. I was on the ""pill"" but was also taking antibiotics at the time and for anyone who doesn't already know, antibiotics will completely cancel out the affects of the birth control pill. I was NOT aware of this at the time and low-and-behold I ended up pregnant with my son.   p.s. just for general information, I was not taking ""the pill"" for birth control reasons.   Not all women who are prescribed it are even sexually active at all. The birth control pill contains synthetic or naturally dirived female hormones, which for some women aids them in attaining a more regular period. Many women atheletes are prescribed birth control because being extremely athletic can disrupt, postpone or completely do away with a woman's natural cycle. Taking birth control helps to ""normalize"" female hormone levels. Such was my case."
750,notsarc,"And the mall plainly had ""no guns allowed"" signs displayed at all the entrances, meaning the shooter broke the law when he brought his gun in and started shooting.   Now, find me a school massacre that took place where concealed carry is actually legal on campus."
751,notsarc,"Misunderstanding or misrepresentation? Biologists and geneticists do not claim that DNA is isolated from the environment. We are well aware that the environment can cause mutations under many conditions (cosmic radiation, x-ray, etc.). What is denied is that mutations are environmentally directed - in other words, exposure to cosmic radiation will not cause a mutation that will make the organism resistant to cosmic radiation. The mutations will be random.   On the other hand, natural selection IS, by definition, the response of populations to their environment. The environment has been shown to have effects on DNA, i.e., the genome of the population."
752,notsarc,What else is new?
753,notsarc,"So you would go with the unknowable argument?   Well then this is applicable to your response:   So now you have said that god is undefinable or often said ""supernatural"".   T:I believe in God   A:What is God?   T:I dont know.   Then my question to you would be that if you dont know what God is... then what is it that you believe in?"
754,notsarc,"It is rather disrespectful but don't think it is limited to one side. Most protestors on both sides aren't great.   one thing did spark my interest, and it is said often, why is it a ""hard decision"" if you are pro-choice? Is it hard because you don't know if you want a baby around or not? Couldn't this decision be just as hard before being pregnant? Even so, why link it to going to an abortion clinic? You hear ""It was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place"" but how is going through some protestors making this decision harder?   No one would admit to this but it is statements like ""It was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place"" that make me believe that someone realizes it is wrong and the struggle that makes it hard is whether or not to do the right thing or do they thing that would benefit you the most. And in that case, I agree...that can be a tough decision."
755,notsarc,"Yes Chrstians should be disarmed so the ""moral"" atheists, humanists, pagans who crucified people should rule over us . . . that would give everyone a warm fuzy feeling inside.   Matt 26: 1 And it happened, when Jesus finished all these sayings, He said to His disciples, 2 You know that the Passover is coming after two days, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.   Of course there are valid reasons why Christ armed His men.   Romans 13: 1 Let every soul be subject to higher authorities, for there is no authority except from God, but the existing authorities have been ordained by God. 2 So that the one resisting authority has opposed the ordinance of God, and the ones opposing will receive judgment to themselves. 3 For the rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the bad. And do you desire not to fear the authority? Do the good, and you will have praise from it; 4 for it is a servant of God to you for the good. But if you practice evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath to the one practicing evil. 5 Because of this, it is necessary to be subject, not only on account of wrath, but also on account of conscience. 6 For on this account you also pay taxes, for they are ministers of God, always giving attention to this very thing. 7 Then give to all their dues: to the one due tax, the tax; to the one due tribute, the tribute; to the one due fear, the fear; to the one due honor, the honor.   Luke 11: 21 When the strong one, having been armed, guards his dwelling, his goods are in peace. 22 But as soon as one stronger than he comes, he overcomes him; he takes away his armor on which he relied, and deals out his arms.   ""a moments notice..."" Well it appears the guaranteed scheduled time is on the day of judgment.   Luke 19: 27 But these enemies of mine, those not desiring me to reign over them, bring them here and execute them before me."

757,notsarc,"They do not hate the concept, they merely reject it as being useful or necessary to explain the material universe. I mean come on what utility would a physics which incorporated miracles be? Nothing would be predictable and all utility would be lost.

Or e=mc2 (god willing)"

759,notsarc,"That's a bad term. I wouldn't call myself that, but I do know more then average person."
760,notsarc,"I know that not all people who are pro-life are woman-hating. I, too want to see abortion reduced to the bare minimum. I just disagree with most pro-lifers on how to accomplish that.   My issue was with ROCC's attitude in the post I was responding to. To summarize he/she said that your shouldn't get pregnant and if you do - you just get to deal with it. There is absolutely no regard for an individual's situation, the attack is entirely focused on women and it offers NOTHING that will help reduce abortion.   ROCC's statement was quite woman-hating, but no, it is not indicative of the pro-life side's feelings about women. The only times I am compelled to really think pro-lifers are anti-woman is when they have the ""pregnancy is a woman's due punishment for promiscuity"" attitude or demand that a woman die/put her health jeapardy or demand rape victims go through with pregnancies. If you can't see the woman in even those most extreme situations, then you clearly have zero regard for women.   I believe that abortion stands it best chance at being reduced by addressing the things that lead to unplanned pregnancy and the reasons women choose to abort. To demonize women and simply take away choice without addressing these things will not reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies, or gauarantee responsible choices. It will lead desperate women to desperate action, though (i.e., coat hangers)."

763,notsarc,"Actually there is a better solution.   Mandatory male and female birth control pills, financial penalties if you stop taking. Anyone who would get off the pill would want a kid, therefore, abortions would cease."

765,notsarc,"Every relationship does entail moral obligations in one way or another, but the argument is that there is no relationship that morally obligates one to share ones body. They are trying to generalize 'moral obligations' as if that justifies anything. There are things that cannot be morally obligated, no matter the relationship, so the argument tries to prove."
766,notsarc,Because there are people who are trying to deny the theory of evolution it's place as a vital part of public school's biology curriculum.
767,notsarc,"Because I am one who likes see things from different angles. What better way to fight your enemies then to understand their viewpoint.

772,notsarc,"Well, sort of. It isn't necessary, but if you're predicting intelligence from what someone does rather than direct measurements of physical properties, knowing their motivation level might allow you to make more accurate predictions.   Nevertheless even without knowing the subjects' motivations at all, today's generic intelligence tests still have excellent predictive power for success in both school and employment, and are perhaps better predictors for future success than any other method we have (including interviews, personality inventories, aptitude in a particular field)"
773,notsarc,"Maybe you need to take a hard look at where your rights start infringing on the rights of others. A pretty good case? Dream on. Sure, you have the rigth to take the morning after pill. you do not have the right to force another individual to sell you that pill, any mroe than you have the right to walk into your local ford dealer and demand that they provide your with a chevy. Its just not the way the world works. People can go to another pharmacy or, not. It really does ntoy matter. Retail establichments are able to decide fro themselves what they carry, the governemtn has no place in such decisions. If they decide not to carry the pill, or the pharmacist simply decides they are not going to dispense it, that is their right. It is entirely an issue between employers and their employees and witht he The American Pharmacists Associations policy that allows pharmacists to refuse to fill presciptions on moral grounds, it is hardly an issue there, either."
774,notsarc,"To force women to have babys that they dont even want is even more ""preposterous""."

776,notsarc,"They are both written in the bible. Neither of them have any evidence (apart from the bible) to support their existence. One of them has been proven to be utterly false. This naturally discredits the other, as they appear in the same publication by the same author. Why decide one is true when the other is clearly not, and neither have any other supporting evidence?"
777,notsarc,"Thanks. But it seems that you don't understand. Perhaps the people of Austin are more intelligent than they are down here in Houston. Maybe it's just that you are surrounded by educated people who show a tendency away from creationism. But you see, I run into people all the time (and meet them on this board too) who think that speciation has never been observed. Why do they think that? Because their holy book tells them so. The herring gull/lesser black-backed gull is an example of a single, vast, globe encircling population that has become separate species at the extremes of it's range - and those extremes overlap. Before I came to Texas the idea that the Book of Genesis was literally true never occurred to me. So it was kind of a neat moment to realize that the big birds around the restaurant dumpster were herring gulls, a living example of a population in the process of forming separate species."
778,notsarc,An attempt by you to dodge the main point.
779,notsarc,"This question is premised on an untenable assumption: that people should not be allowed to vote on particular issues. This premise is clearly not true in any democratic society, and is especially not true in the United States. In the United States, it is a contradiction in terms to say someone is not allowed to vote on X. I have demonstrated this before, and yet the same silly question keeps coming up."
780,notsarc,"Well it could mean simple instinct, and I think you will find it was only applied to animals with brains. EAM attributes ""intelligence"" even to bacteria and to corn plants, trees, jellyfish, single celled eukaryotes etc. If one is to consider intelligence the main driver of adaptation it must be omnipresent in living organisms - there is zero support for this concept."
781,notsarc,"Are you trying to make a point here? Or are you just spewing forth your hoplophobic tendencies because you're got nothing better to do?   One of the problems with school children is that it's become a crime to discipline them the way our parents were disciplined. There's no spankings, corner times, or sitting on a chair with a dunce cap, because that's all been labeled as abuse to emotional development. Instead we have counseling and the administration of powerful prescription drugs to kids who can barely read.   Kids are spoiled rotten and left unsupervised with TV shows and video games that glorify violence and murdering people for fun. Parents are stuck working two or more jobs just to make enough money for bills so they don't wind up on the streets.   We need massive reform. We gotta go back to how kids were raised in the 50s."

783,notsarc,"'IF' is the question. It suggests that Holy Tradition does not know the answer.   Secondly, the issue of the flood itself could still be true and tested scientifically... as to whether an historical Noah existed that you might consign to 'myth'.   Does anyone here not find it interesting that there is almost a universal factor in societies concerning a global flood?   PS I have already discussed M-Eve on another post."

787,notsarc,Humans cannot cleanse themselves of their sins.
788,notsarc,"That's because its sophistry. Its an inherent contradiction and it simply means we don't have the capacity to understand it. Another more common example is that the assertion that the universe cannot be endless, and yet as far as we know it is. Trying to understand it is for us humans like an ant trying to fathom the theory of relativity.   Damn are we ever conceited as a race...we seem to think that if we can't understand something, it cannot be. We also tend to think, in every generation, that we have achieved somehow the pinnacle of progress."
789,notsarc,"That's not evolution. Life has evolved in the lab, many times."
790,notsarc,"As pointed out, with a different physics, chemistry and biology, the universe as we know it wouldn't exist. What is really damaging to the concept of creationism as truth is a list of what we should expect if a flood had occurred under the same laws of science that are in operation today. One problem with creationism (I know, you want to ignore the problems) is that they constantly fall back on miracle in order to do a reset of reality in order to circumvent reality when creationism bumps into scientifically impossible events.   I don't mean to rain on the parade, but with all that said, it has been done. There is a list of 28 items, originally compiled by Jim Moore, that we should find if the flood happened as per the Bible. Not even miracles can solve these. That list is followed by further problems that have been compiled by Ken Harding from numerous sources.   What Would We Expect to Find if the World Had Flooded   For more information you can refer to the Flood Geology FAQs at TO. Two items with information that specifically addresses the question of the OP are Problems with a Global Flood, and The Geologic Column and its Implications for the Flood ."
791,notsarc,"The simple fact is that people don't want the immense responsibility that logically pertains to their voluntary actions actions, so they fabricate denials of reality as a convenient escape, out of pure selfishness-- like every other atrocity in history.   The study of law includes an analysis of how people excuse their wrongdoings, fabricating pausible rationalizations for their acting to benefit at another's expense; denial is typically the first of these, claiming that the act ""does not hurt anyone,"" however obvious the contrary. Other rationales follow, such as self-preservation, natural right to act, and eventually growing defensive by blaming the victim.   While the fabricator typically believes his story original, it is anything but-- it's simply the inevitable course of selfishness."
792,notsarc,"I don't understand your question. If law-abiding gun owners were overwhelming those who should not have access to guns, those who use guns unlawfully, I would be very pleased.   But, as far as I can see, the only goal of the gunners is to make sure that everyone has a gun, no matter how insane, no matter how stupid, no matter how incapable they may be to own such easy-to-use instruments of death."
793,notsarc,"Evolution theory is not science at all, it is faith. Period.   How can I conclude that? Because an examination of the evidence shows that a bias/ ideology/ Godless belief system is the only real evidence for evolution theory:   evolutionist Stephen Jay Gould: ?Our ways of learning about the world are strongly influenced by the social pre-conceptions and biased modes of thinking that each scientist must apply to any problem.?   Evolutionary biologist Richard Lewontin said: ?we have a prior commitment to materialism. It is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel us to accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world, but, on the contrary, that we are forced by our priori adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations, no matter how counter-intuitive?Moreover, that materialism is an absolute, for we cannot allow a divine foot in the door.?"

795,notsarc,"Armour piercing ammo, 100% legal. Here is where you can buy SS109 armour piercing ammo: http://ammoman.com/   I agree, the Brady Bill is laughable to criminals who want the contraban items. You do not even have to buy them, you can make them yourself.   I agree that the cops are not the best protection. The best protection is YOU for YOURSELF. Only you are on the spot the quickest when you are threatened. Only you are able the judge quickest weather your saftey is threatened. Seach on any engine: police accidental shooting. It is quite alarming how many times cops shoot the innocent. If cops can get to a crime scene in time, they have to sort out the criminal and the victim very quickly under difficult conditions. In essence, they do not get the whole story, until it is over. You may even gen a criminal pretending to be a victim, only to shoot the cops in the back. That is why victims at the crime scene are the best judge of who needs to be shoot first.   For my own personal situation, I do not recommend just buying a gun for protection. Also seek training and lots of it. Then practice, practice, practice, and then practice some more. No matter how justified you are defending your life with firearm, you must still defend your actions in a court of law, especially if human life was taken.   I do not agree with people carrying firearms with no training. That is a very personal decision and I will not stop anyone from carrying a firearm if they choose to do so."

799,notsarc,Your wrong. Airplanes and courthouses are gun free zones but these places never have massacres.
800,notsarc,"A perfect example of why Christian fundamentalismm and evolution can't co-exist. If God is wrong, then the Bible is wrong. Evolution contradicts the Bible, plain and simple."

802,notsarc,"Fish to Amphibian supporting evidence frmo here:   Fish/Amphibian   Transition from primitive bony fish to amphibians:   Paleoniscoids again (e.g. Cheirolepis)   Osteolepis -- one of the earliest crossopterygian lobe-finned fishes, still sharing some characters with the lungfish (the other group of lobe-finned fish). Had paired fins with a leg-like arrangement of bones, and had an early-amphibian-like skull and teeth.   Eusthenopteron (and other rhipidistian crossopterygian fish) -- intermediate between early crossopterygian fish and the earliest amphibians. Skull very amphibian-like. Strong amphibian-like backbone. Fins very like early amphibian feet.   Icthyostegids (such as Icthyostega and Icthyostegopsis) -- Terrestrial amphibians with many of Eusthenopteron's fish features (e.g., the fin rays of the tail were retained). Some debate about whether Icthyostega should be considered a fish or an amphibian; it is an excellent transitional fossil.   Labyrinthodonts (e.g., Pholidogaster, Pteroplax) -- still have some icthyostegid features, but have lost many of the fish features (e.g., the fin rays are gone, vertebrae are stronger and interlocking, the nasal passage for air intake is well defined.)   And while nothing is ever proven 100% in science, the link between fish and amphibians is pretty conclusive. Evidence for dino to bird evolution just keeps mounting and at present it is the best supported theory. Just look at the recent discovery of an oviraptorosaurian dinosaur with 2 eggs still in it's body, two very bird like eggs.....See here:   dinoeggs   So once again, while not proven 100%, dino to bird evolution is the best supported theory. Do you have anything that is better supported???"

If you will recall the average northern soldier wasn't too fond of blacks, and that is not only sugar coating it, but saying it in the nicest terms possible. The civil war was fought to keep the union in tact. Border states still kept their slaves for obvious reasons, the intactness of the union trumped any moral principal. Besides, that wasn't true even in practice. Black soldiers were paid less, had less equipment, had less medical care and were given the worst jobs possible. Hardly created equal. It took some time before they could even fight. Your argument is a load of garbage to someone who actually has knownledge about the civil war.

832,notsarc,"Zoos are indeed a good example. Although the environments are made as close as possible to the natural habitats, penguins are often kept in open-air enclosures in temperate or even tropical climates. And there are two critical differences in even the most carefully constructed zoo: the absence of any predators, and the absence of any prey. So why don't the animals quickly/purposefully/nonrandomly cease exhibiting developmentally costly traits which give them an advantage against predators or prey who aren't present?"
833,notsarc,Well I think that the geology of the planet would influence everything. From religions to morals and scientific progression. Because long ago on our planet Europe not only thought the world was flat and they could fall over at the edge into an abyss but Europe generally didn't have knowledge of the Asian cultures until the silk road was active. If the asian and european cultures were not so greatly distanced from each other history would have been greatly changed to the extent that compared to our world would be pretty loopy
834,notsarc,"In a way, taking rights away is an American value since we have prescribed methods for doing it. For instance, we have legislatures which posess authority to remove a large number of what you likely consider to be rights.

The fact is that you don't object to taking rights away in principle, you only object to taking away those rights that you wish to retain. That is quite inconsistent.

838,notsarc,"This is different than stating that abortion is the same, in principle, as killing a born child. We are back on the question of ""Why would someone do this horrible thing"" which pro-life people continually ask and has been answered in many ways by many people.

Sorry, didn't mean to offend there but I still think its better than another baby has a chance to live than pretty much anything with respect to the desceased. If it happened to me I would have no problem at all about any of my organs being used to save lives, either directly or indirectly through training of more doctors or research. Yet, I still respect your wishes and said before that if this is going to happen it should certainly be cleared with the parents first. You're just going to have to accept my appologies and realise that I have no idea what you went through, having not been there myself.   Being in an abortion forum, and the nature of the first post it seemed very quite possible that Fishx had had an abortion, though regretted it and wanted the remains to bury - this is a very different case than the one you have unfortunately experienced, hence the question."

Giving specific reasons for gun ownership is the top of a slippery slope towards banning certain firearms.   While I have specific reasons for owning specific guns, to include hunting, I own some of my guns for no other reason than they are fun to shoot.

The reality would probably be, as you say, that they would mix up faith and reason and start claiming one is ""actually correct"", and the other is ""The work of the devil"", and proceed to clobber the other religion, absorb their members, abordb the traditions that were ""popular"" from the other religion, rename them and re-color them to match their religion, and carry on proclaiming truth and the afterlife and mercy and whatever else pops into their heads.

852,notsarc,"Is that a trick question? No, the tabloid and other gutter press keep going on about how bad it is, because they sell papers by fanning fear and hatred, and fear of crime is one of their biggest markets. Yes there has been an increase in gun crime over the years, but that's largely attributable to increased attractiveness of crime in a society where social mobility has come to a standstill. In any case the number of incidents where firearms are used in crime is still very small, which is why every time someone gets shot it is headline news.   Guns are incredibly rare in this country, the only time I've seen guns in real life (other than air rifles) is on a military base."
853,notsarc,"Everything basically.   You're held captive by hostile natives that have set up barricades and checkpoints around the property you live on.

854,notsarc,"This was pretty much my understanding of how natural selection was viewed before Darwin.   Nonetheless, I think that my point still stands. Darwin proposed that natural selection is responsible for the diversification of species. This pre-Darwin concept denies this. My understanding is that anti-evolutionists refused to accept that natural selection could have led to the diversification of species. Until recently, when they realized that evolutionary theory could help out in their how-many-animals-could-fit-on-the-ark dilemma; now they suddenly take an idea from evolutionary science and propose that suddenly all the present species could ""micro-evolve"" from a few ancestral ""kinds"" on the ark."

I don't understand why your ignoring the debate and going off in a whole new direction even after making this same mistake in your last post. You're still showing that the Bible has a flaw in it and therefore your making up your own story about what happened. You're also making predictions about the future based on your own interpretation.

[quote]The above fully answers the apparent contradiction you and others find in these passages. The reason you may think I may be presenting information contrary to normative Christian teaching is that you have picked a peculiarly thorny passage - something that skeptics of the Bible and enemies of God will almost always do.[\QUOTE]   It only answers the contradiction after you fill in the blanks with your own interpretation and of course your interpretation is based on your personal views and no facts. All the facts that you can work with are in the Bible and as of this moment the Bible seems to have a flaw in it. Your trying to cover this flaw with a story that you made up. I guess in your mind this makes sense but I don't think many Christians would even agree with you much less those of us who look for logic.
867,notsarc,"Yes. It describes an action without ascribing its form to its end result, outcome, whatever but strictly to a cause/s force/s in action. That is why 'selection' is always teleological. In order to select or choose anything, an end must always be in view. There must always be a volitional discrimination of options based upon a criterion dictated by the desired end. The only time ""channel"" becomes teleological is when something live [a human or a beaver, let's say] intententionally does the channeling. But since it is understood that mechanical forces can also 'channel', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological. In the same way, 'sorting' can be considered non-teleological, hence mechanical, and thus suited to your glossary, because things can be sorted by mechanical forces alone. But 'selection' always requires volition and awareness. So 'selection' is always teleological."

884,notsarc,"So where in there does Behe say that brute luck is actually impossible? Nowhere.   Where in there does Behe say that brute luck can be absolutely and definitively ruled out, 100%. Nowhere.   As I originally said, “We can find such an explanation wanting or unsatisfying, but being highly unlikely is not the same as proving it could not happen.” This is quite in line with Behe's statements in his book. Further, PROVING it IMPOSSIBLE is what you would have had to have done to PROVE that evolution is false. Behe says it can't be proven impossible: that it can't be completely refuted.   (And quite frankly, most of us would agree that claiming that an IC system - or multiple IC systems - arose by multiple simultaneous mutations is in no way comparable to claiming that “the word luckily popped into existence yesterday with all the features it now has.” Behe's not being fully honest here.)   What I quoted Behe saying is exactly what he said and is his position on the matter. I have NOT misrepresented Behe's position on this.   Now, a charge of wrongdoing is discarded unless the party making the accusation can fully support his charge: burden of proof falls upon the accuser, not the accused. You've failed to support your charge, so I prevail.   Now, if you want to continue pushing your charge of wrongdoing on my part, you need to show where, in Behe's “Darwin's Black Box”, he goes on to show that brute luck is actually impossible: where Behe shows that brute luck can be absolutely and definitively ruled out, 100%. Until you do, you have failed to rebut my counter to your statements, and, I am also cleared of your false charges.   PS: The only one playing around with context here is YOU! The context of my statements was that you claimed to have PROVEN EVOLUTION false, and I pointed out that:   (1) in order for you to have succeeded, one of several things you would have to do (but didn't) is to DISPROVE multiple, simultaneous mutations (brute luck)   and   (2) Behe himself says that multiple, simultaneous mutations CANNOT be absolutely ruled out.   Try to keep the context, okay."

AIMHO, God teaches us the spirit of creation with the inspired allegories written in the Bible. God created it all, He just did it in a fashion we will likely never fully understand.   AIMHO, there were thousands of Adams and Eves, created after an evolutionary process that started when God created all matter and time.

896,notsarc,"This is a statement written by someone who obviously has not read scripture. One of the most astonising ""proofs"" if you will, that the Bible is of supernatural origin, is predictive prophecy. Science cannot, as you claim, ""explain"" everything, and it has no natural explanation for the   predictions made in scripture. How can science explain through statistical probablity the over 600 prophecies in Biblical writings that have come to pass? Also, how can it explain how supposedly uneducated people (uneducated in the ways of modern science) wrote about astronomy as if they knew about the universe as we do today. How could they have described the hydrological cycle as we have only come to know it recently?   Ecclesiastes 1:6   The wind goes toward the south,   And turns around to the north;   The wind whirls about continually,   And comes again on its circuit.   How did they know that the earth ""hangs on nothing"" when the accepted norm of the day did not even accept that possibility?   Job 26:7   He stretches out the north over empty space;   He hangs the earth on nothing.   How did they know that the ""vapors"" of the earth rise to create moisture, that is seeded by lightning with nitrogen and then falls as rain to fertilze the soil?   Jeremiah 10:13   When He utters His voice,   There is a multitude of waters in the heavens:   ?And He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth.   He makes lightning for the rain,   He brings the wind out of His treasuries.?   Hydrothermal vents[4] are described in two books of the Bible written before 1400BC?more than 3,000 years before their discovery by science.   Genesis 7:11   In the six hundredth year of Noah?s life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.   Even though the Bible is not a scientific text book and doesn't purport to be, nowhere is it scientifically inaccurate. In addition, many of the scientific ideas you are so impressed with are nothing new to the Bible. It was speaking of these things long before modern science spoke of them.   The story goes ""They (scientists) are slowly working their way to the mountain's peak painstakingly measuring and analyzing every step that they take. After many years of research, they finally arrive at the top of the mountain, scale over its leading edge, only to find a group of theologians sitting there with the answers all along."""

908,notsarc,"Nearly all animal phyla* made their first appearance in the fossil record at essentially the same time, an interval of some 5 million years [ET**] (about 525 to 530 million years ago [ET**]) called the ""Cambrian Explosion.""51   Scientists have found that these early fossils exhibit more anatomical body designs than exist today, and that early animals, the trilobites, had eyes as fully developed as their counterparts today.38   Many of the Cambrian fauna, still survive today, all looking much like they did over 500 million [ET**] years ago. The prominent British evolutionist, Richard Dawkins, comments, ""... [W]e find many of them already in an advanced state of evolution, the very first time they appear. It is as though they were just planted there, without any evolutionary history.""51   Two places in the world that have an abundance of early (Cambrian) fossils; the Burgess Shale in the Canadian Rockies and the Chengjiang site in China.38   In Stephen J. Gould's popular book, Wonderful Life, he points out that the Burgess Shale Cambrian fossils include ""a range of disparity in anatomical design never again equaled, and not matched today by all the creatures in the world's oceans.""38   Further, these fossils contain some twenty to thirty kinds of arthropods*** that cannot be placed in any modern group. The modern arthropods, consisting of almost a million species, can all fit into four major groups. But ""one quarry in British Columbia, representing the first explosion of multicellular life, reveals more than twenty additional arthropod designs."" Today there are about 38 phyla in existence, but the Canadian, Chinese and other Cambrian sites reveal over fifty phyla.38   There has been a decrease in diversity (probably due to global catastrophes). This is the reverse of what evolutionary theory predicts.38   Besides diversity, the Burgess Shale shows exquisite detail, right down to ""the last filament of a trilobite's gill,"" or the last meal in a worm's gut.38   The Chengjiang site has even greater detail, and is earlier. According to Paul Chien, the chairman of the biology department at the University of San Francisco, said the preservation is such that internal organs, nerves, and even the water ducts of jellyfish are observable.38   Researchers found striking similarities between the compound eyes of the Cambrian trilobites and those of modern insects. According to Riccardo Levi-Setti, ""Trilobites could see in their immediate environment with amazingly sophisticated optical devices in the form of large composite eyes. ... The number of individual optical elements in the compound eye could vary from approximately one hundred to more than fifteen thousand in a single eye, a range not very different from that found in modern insects.""38   The conclusion is that the eye, a complex visual system, was fully formed and functional extremely early in the fossil record. Obviously, this is not predicted by evolutionary theory.38   Until recently, the phylum of vertebrates had been considered a later arrival in evolutionary history. But not now! Even the vertebrate phylum now extends into the Cambrian period, especially with the recent discovery of two fossil fish in China.51   The two new fossils . . . from Chengjiang are the most convincing Early Cambrian vertebrates ever found. The insects and other land invertebrates are also a very important group, and these practically all seem to be living fossils.51   These complex animals were present at the beginning of multicellular life and did not appear later as is predicted by evolutionary theory.38   Evolution does not explain the abrupt appearance of complex forms of life early in the fossil record or these fossils' unequaled diversity. The implication of the Cambrian explosion of diverse, fully functional, and multicellular life is that evolutionary theory is falsified.38   Life did not start out simple and evolve into more complex and diverse animals; it was complex and diverse right at the beginning. This contradiction between the fossil data and the predictions of evolutionary theory falsifies the theory.38   ""The facts of paleontology seem to support creation rather than evolution. All the major groups of invertebrates appear suddenly in the first fossiliferous strata. (Cambrian) of the earth with their distinct specializations, indicating that they were all created at almost the same time."" - David Enock Associate Professor of Biology. BS Yeshiva College, MS Hunter College50   Even George Gaylord Simpson, Harvard high priest of evolution had to admit, “In spite of the examples, it remains true (as every paleontologist knows) that most new species, genera and families appear in the record suddenly, and are not led up to by known, gradual, completely continuous transitional sequences.”50   http://www.straight-talk.net/evolution/explosion.htm"

And not the bloodthirsty, venomous, purely vengeful thing that it is.   He sounds like a very principled individual to me. With this, yet one more indication that the death penalty system in our country is unsustainable. Not only for moral reasons, but because it is not shown to serve as an effective deterrent, and because the overwhelmed system is not supportable, under our American Constitution, often punishing everyone involved, even the families of victims.

Like many decisions in life, this is one that is difficult to come to. It doesn't mean it's a wrong one. It's hard because your options are so very serious."
923,notsarc,"And yet I alread showed what the ""moral code"" of atheistic societies has done for the world:   II 128,168,000 VICTIMS: THE DEKA-MEGAMURDERERS   4. 61,911,000 Murdered: The Soviet Gulag State   5. 35,236,000 Murdered: The Communist Chinese Ant Hill   6. 20,946,000 Murdered: The Nazi Genocide State   7. 10,214,000 Murdered: The Depraved Nationalist Regime   III 19,178,000 VICTIMS: THE LESSER MEGA-MURDERERS   8. 5,964,000 Murdered: Japan's Savage Military   9. 2,035,000 Murdered: The Khmer Rouge Hell State   10. 1,883,000 Murdered: Turkey's Genocidal Purges   11. 1,670,000 Murdered: The Vietnamese War State   12. 1,585,000 Murdered: Poland's Ethnic Cleansing   13. 1,503,000 Murdered: The Pakistani Cutthroat State   14. 1,072,000 Murdered: Tito's Slaughterhouse   IV 4,145,000 VICTIMS: SUSPECTED MEGAMURDERERS   15. 1,663,000 Murdered?

924,notsarc,"Yes, the horror of voluntarily taking orders from someone in exchange for monetary rewards!!   If you hate your job that much, quit. You aren't being oppressed because someone offered you the option to do something. If you don't like it, don't do it. If you hate trade, you can go wander through the wilderness and eat berries and roots."
925,notsarc,"If your friend is hearing voices in her head to walk into traffic, she needs some psychiatric help."
926,notsarc,"A lot of work has been done on that topic. I would recommend reading Debating Design from Darwin to DNA It is a monster of a book, but it is definitely worth the read."
927,notsarc,You know what they call people like you?   Victims.
928,notsarc,"I responded to your posts on the thread of ""Lets discuss the actual..."" I suggest we continue that discussion there."
929,notsarc,"Actually, the storm lasted for 40 days and 40 nights. The ark was actually afloat for a year or so. So I guess the answer is that the ark had all kinds of pestilent insects winging about and biting and stinging the occupants. The problem is, how did these aquatic breeders actually propagate in the feces and urine infested bilge of the ark?"
930,notsarc,"oh, now we're getting somewhere. Explain more, please. Oh, and some evidence of incremental modifications would be nice too."
931,notsarc,http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/18/op...18kristof.html
932,notsarc,"To a small extent, this happens already. Oftentimes (21.3%, U.S.), a woman decides to have and abortion because she cannot afford a baby (from here, source). This is in effect removing members of society who are non-productive (babies produce virtually nothing useful until they mature by about 10 years). And poor families are less productive, since they are often on welfare.   Granted, this is a rather harsh perspective, but the effect is the same: In the U.S., there are about (21.3% X 1.31 million) 280,000 less people every year who would have likely grown up in a poor home (assuming the child wouldn't have been adopted). Forced contraception/abortion is seen as an effective way of solving poverty in some parts of the world..."
933,notsarc,"By removing you mean Killing the innocent of course, which is different to imprisonment of the criminal."
934,notsarc,"maybe, but see, that does not match the materialist universe?"
935,notsarc,"Hello there. The principle behind a pro-life Christian supporting the death penalty (I am one) is this: We are talking of innocent life. The death penalty is justified for a person who is guilty of commiting a crime against a society that has that law. The child never did anything wrong. I know of other beleivers who don't support the death penalty, so basically, it's an in-house debate."

937,notsarc,"The 'teachings' either have no substance, or are certainly not original. Demonstrate categorically just who is the Son of God, and why this figure commands worship and obeisance."
938,notsarc,"Actually the Apocrypha is made up of pre-Christian texts, and late 4th century is a bit of a stretch for the new testament, certainly all its component texts were widely accepted by the 2nd century. I don't whether it is ""generally accepted"" that the text was altered, it seems to me that you are projecting your own views based on the hypotheses of some scholars on to Biblical scholarship in general."
939,notsarc,"Exactly. It is their fault, but they can do what they choose. It is punishment and you know it, and it is not your job to make sure no ""irresponsible"" pregnant woman goes unpunished."
940,notsarc,"Yes, because its THEIR decision, its THEIR stomachs, and its THEIR lives. I agree that some decisions do need to be made with parental consent, but not this one.   Irrelevant. How does purchasing a house have to do with abortion?   Ok, so what if the kid wants to have the baby and the adults want to get rid of it? What if the adults want her to have the baby and the kid wants to get rid of it? You would force the kid to have a child (that doesn't seem responsible at all), or you would force the kid to abort her child (thereby taking away her son or daughter). Both of those decisions don't sound very consitent or responsible. The decision is best left up to the person that is pregnant, regardless of their age."
941,notsarc,You are correct.
942,notsarc,"I see, thanks for answering my question."
943,notsarc,"Speaking of which, did you happen to see this image that someone kindly forwarded to me?   http://iowntheworld.com/blog/wp-cont...iew-lo-res.jpg"
944,notsarc,"That isn't my logic. My logic states that banning doctors would cause more deaths and our current system does. You are trying to debate that doctors are threatening withour realizing that they have great rewards as well. My logic is to look for the risk and reward and not just focus on one side of the debate.   Your logic was that since doctors cause deaths then they should be banned if guns are, correct? Then why isn't it also consistant with your logic to believe that we should ban food since food causes deaths?   So lets clairfy here, do you believe that guns have a better risk/reward than doctors? If you HAD to ban one which would it be? I await your sidestep of the question.   lol, now your comparing the Jews to current US gun issues? Why did you choose to do this? The risk-reward for Jews is different than the risk-reward for the US. Jews probably would have faired better if the Germans used Japanise gun control laws."
945,notsarc,Correct. Form letters go in a junk pile. Individual letters are a different matter.
946,notsarc,"Sure. The outcome of Heller vs DC and Florida Shall - Issue laws support that statement. According to Brady logic, the more helpless you are, the safer you are from criminals."
947,notsarc,"Actually, submitting samples that will return bogus dates is dishonest. Creationists have done this several times."
948,notsarc,"What's your claim? That the seasonal molt of arctic foxes is evolution or that it is not? As usual, your responses show muddled thinking."
949,notsarc,"They do offer a good insulating blanket which would keep the body of the reptile warm which in turn, would allow the reptile to remain active for a longer period of time. This means more time to hunt and reproduce carrying the mutation onwards."
950,notsarc,"Humm. More guns, more Concealed Carry and Violent Crime and Murder is down to it's lowest levels since they started to record it. So how can these studies be credible or considered in anyway correct."
951,notsarc,Interesting thought..... such a situation would theorectically remove the division of opinion that exists based upon the perspective of gender (ie. the pro-life religious male) and would make any difference of opinion be based on moral/philosophical considerations alone.   You could argue it would shift opinion towards the mix currently held by women as everyone would be in the position of having to bear pregnancy. Given that there is a full mix of religious and other beliefs in the current day female population perhaps this would be a good analogy to such a state of being you suggest.
952,notsarc,Mother's choice at all times.
953,notsarc,These items do not have killing as their primary use.
954,notsarc,"Well, if burglars want to steal guns then it makes sense that they would be likely to target the homes of gun owners. And the source is from the recently published book Evaluating Gun Policy which you can read and review. The source is listed at the bottom."
955,notsarc,"Good shooting! Got two illegal alien perps that had been deported for previous felonies and just committed another after illegally entering the country again.   WE NEED MORE JOE HORNS and a heck of a lot less bradies!   Is this the only case you could find of a CCW exercising his rights (you know the law applies to any citizen of Texas don't you and they need not be licensed?) completely justified in the Penal Code of Texas. Self-defense and defense of a third person or property is justified and required by law...IT IS YOUR PUBLIC DUTY.   Job well done Mr. Horn!!   How come you don't post links (deleted by poster)? This is old news, almost 3 years ago to be exact. Did you think it was sensational? LOL"
956,notsarc,"So, in summary, you aren't against the death penalty on principle. You just want it used judiciously? Same here. Where we'll differ is in the details of what's judiciously."
957,notsarc,"And it also took an amendment to give the slaves rights, not a judge."
958,notsarc,they may respect life but what about respecting the quality of life?   if they cared about their children's future they would not breed like rabbits. It is callous to use their children to win the 'numbers game'   quality before quantity.   I don't deny that abortion is murder in the womb though.
959,notsarc,"Yet another alleged lie, by the Hillary-haters, shown not to be."
960,notsarc,"Oh shut up! You're just sore because your side lost in the McDonald case and now you're left with absolutely nothing. You know that many gun laws are going to fall to the sword of justice, and you just can't stand the fact that your side is going to be brought back into check, just like any other."
961,notsarc,"No, they do not. I know several people in England who posess weapons the bought on the street. How are the gun laws in england working when you can buy a machine gun?   Before the ban, england had lower numbers when it came to firearms related deaths. They also had lower crime numbers. The sociological differences between England and the United States are not be be discounted.   It is interesting to note that crime rates in England seem to be rising now that the gun ban has been around for a while. There is even a movement by public officials to arm police officers in response to the rising rate of violent crime. There isa n article and debate about it right here on the forums.   The biggest difference lately in the statistics in England in the US is not the numbers, it is how they are recorded. If a guy is confronted by three people outside a bar and shot to death, but the gus get off during trial, it is still recorded in America s a three person homocide. In england, it is NOT recorded. I get the London Times, and they have done several articles accusing th British government of manipulating crime figures. I think that if we in America only recorded solved crimes in our crime statistics, we might become one of the most cime free contries in the world!"
962,notsarc,"Because self-defence, unlike most other 'reasons', automatically allows all citizens firearm access, and in most cases allows firearm acess without mandatory training/evaluation. When this occurs, you are much more likely to get misuse of firearms.   If you read around you'll see that I consider all rights as needing justification. This comes both from my stance as a relativist and as a UK citizen, where there is no formalised Constitution. Ask yourself this - if a right cannot be justified, why should it be treated as a 'right'?"
963,notsarc,"Yes it is, police aren't obligated by the US Constitution to protect individual citizens. If they were, lawsuits could be filed every time a crime is committed, and the police would go bankrupt really quick."
964,notsarc,"Then you freely admit that you lied when you said this, and I quote: People like Arch are setting it as opposed to science and in that position it will be doomed to fail.   AND   Arch is doing nothing but distorting the very thing he holds so dear, I mean, how is accurately quoting passages from the bible distorting it in any way? You do nothing but post drivel which makes no factual statements at all. And you call that debating?"
965,notsarc,"So every woman who has an abortion lives an irresponsible life. Care to give any examples, or are you just spouting rubbish with no experience or knowledge whatsoever?"
966,notsarc,"LOL! If my post was about either of those things, I would cut it down. The vast majority of the post, however, is about the objections to irreducible complexity."
967,notsarc,So individual cells contract to move cytoplasm around and to transport oxygen within itself?
968,notsarc,"The fear of God? What God? Only yours or any God? How about the fear of something greater than yourself? Would that be progress?   I'm not trying to inform you or anyone else of anything at this time. I posted thread originally to get reactions to it so that I could better judge whether those views were valid or not. As a side affect people may be influenced by the debates that happen here, but I am doing this for myself more than I am for anyone else. So don't think I'm trying to push anyone to believe anything, although I do wish for people to question their own views as a way to best understand what they believe in and why they believe it. Based on the way you posted here, it is my guess you are unwilling to do that in the case presented here."
969,notsarc,"I know, Chloe's misuse of the word strikes again."
970,notsarc,**   Quod erat demonstrandum.
971,notsarc,OK try the US Constitution. We are a representative democratic republic not a majority rule nation. Majorities hold certain powers but they are limited. Minorities continue to have rights which may not be infringed by the majority. Amibiguity and sharing of interests in various types of personal and social decisions is a necessary component of this system. We are built on compromise and that has served us well.
972,notsarc,Give it a rest... what is evident here is more coffeehouse vasilation on your part... no foam.
973,notsarc,ABORTION IS NOT BAD.   That's all that needs to be said.
974,notsarc,"I see a subtle distinction here. Creationism is concerned with the spiritual origins of people. ""Evolutionism"" is entirely concerned with explaining the nature and history of the physical world. The conflict of opinion arises out of the importance of the detail- can Genesis be accepted as a parable which contains a fundemental truth or must it be taken as a historical account?"
975,notsarc,And i dont really believe in god because he has shown us NO compelling evidence of his existance.
976,notsarc,"No, not really..."
977,notsarc,But we have an enumerated Constitutional RKBA. Apples to oranges.
978,notsarc,I'm not arguing that gun control will change the nature of men- though guns may make them more willing and confident to engage in crime. With guns criminals can do even more damage. Adding guns to crime is like adding gasoline to a fire- it makes an already existing problem worse. If you think that just as many people die from stabbing and beatings in other developed nations as people die from guns in the US then you need to do more research.
979,notsarc,"But they didn't have sexual relations. This was from a sperm bank- there was nothing that made the two people create one being.   Nonetheless, this is a side issue for future debates. My main point is homosexuality is a disorder that the government shouldn't be condoning. The government obviously doesn't condone pedophilia, poligamy, and incest. Why is the government condoning homosexuality?"
980,notsarc,"Yes, they do show a faithful devotion to the ultimate reality that there are no gods. You're an atheist, aren't you?"
981,notsarc,"I don't believe Hell is a place either (or even if I believe in hell to begin with), but tell me more about what you mean by this. It sounds interesting."
982,notsarc,"And you people whine at me about using personal insults ( )... anyhow, once a fetus is eight months, I believe, they are fully developed and ready for a premature birth. I was born prematurely, so don't tell me it doesn't happen. So if you get an abortion at eight months, you're not killing a fetus, you're killing a baby."
983,notsarc,"So indignities offered our citizens will be tolerated if dispensed in small doses?   Maybe we might educate the pirates what they should ""know better"" than to try.   My taxes pay to have a Navy presence around the world. Americans are American interests."
984,notsarc,I think that case was in Georgia (a different state) and so far as I know homosexuality was not involved. However if you want to worry about a legal case you need to look at Dover Pa. Not the sticker case in Cobb County.
985,notsarc,"I'm not aware that the police used violence in arresting any of the people discussed in this case. Besides, I'm not discussing personal morality here, I'm discussing what should be legal, and what is practical in a society where not everyone shares the same moral views. Government is there to apply limits to what is permitted, based on the will of the people."
986,notsarc,"Tell that to CDC pathologists. Or just read this post.   ETA: Alternatively, let's look at the logic in this way: because the field of quantum mechanics is useless for helping me describe classical physical systems, quantum mechanics must be wrong. I think this illustrates the fallacy satisfactorily."
987,notsarc,"BWAHAHAHAHHAAH!   Innocent citizens are FIVE TIMES more likely to be mistakenly shot by a cop, than a cop even DELIBERATELY by a civilian!   Likewise, if my life is in danger, then I'm not really too worried about my lack of accountability to the person choosing to ENDANGER it; and I'm really sure if he's willling to commit armed murder then he's not too worried about misdemeanor gun-laws.   Psht, it's amazing how stupid, naive and arrogant these anti-gun XXXXXX are.   It's easy to get cute when someone ELSE'S life is on the line, but it's just plain evil to use the guns of the state, to take away someone ELSE'S guns and expose them to danger-- and particularly cowardly and hyopcrticial while cringing behind a safe neighborhood and lifestyle, while hiding from potential danger-- than shamelessly attacking those who simply fight BACK."
988,notsarc,"You pointed out someone that had 6 fingers.   I said that making a copy is not creating anything new, I never mentioned anything about reproduction."
989,notsarc,Do you mean someone who was wrong? I asked you before to give an example of where Newton found empirical evidence of God. You failed to do so. I suspect that you can't.
990,notsarc,"Ingus, please see my comments at the end of my previous post.   The purpose of this thread is to introduce ourselves and have a Q&amp;A about the basis for each others views etc.   If you want to debate the specific differences we may have in our views, either open a new thread and invite me over, challenge me, whatever...   But I'm not going to debate it here.   I think this thread is a great idea.   People should introduce themselves, lay out their views however they see fit and let others do the same."
991,notsarc,Old news. There have been accusations of similar stories for years.
992,notsarc,The Skeptic has requested no judges.   This actually suits me as there are too many of you that I'd have to pick from and I therefore avoid slighting anyone by not picking them
993,notsarc,I'm not.   ---
994,notsarc,"I believe this is wrong. But this is a private company, and if they want to discriminate based on religion, that's fine, just as a church may outlaw atheists. Do I agree with it? No. But does it have to do with our debate? No. This is about the science classroom. Also, again abiogenesis is a hypothesis, the same level as ID."
995,notsarc,"Monty babbles:   Again Monty has shown that he doesn't bother to learn what he is talking about before he speaks. It is not true that science has ""found"" the mitochondrial Eve, nor is it true that it shows that one person can have all the DNA necessary for all the variation in human population. Both ideas are ridiculous in the extreme. The mitochondrial (note spelling monty) Eve is a mathematical concept. If the estimates of the mutation rate of mitochondrial DNA are correct, then she lived about 200,000 years ago or so.   And of course, the variation in human populations is carried by the nuclear DNA, not the mitochondria. High school biology students know this. And, of course, recent analysis has shown that every gene in the human genome has an average of 14 alleles. Since a single person can carry only two alleles of any gene, monty's assertion becomes pure nonsense.   Hank says:   Really? When and by whom? I wasn't even aware that it was an hypothesis but simply a mathematical concept derived from the mutation rate of the mitochondrial DNA. Possibly the time has been adjusted due to differing estimates of the mutatiion rate, but the concept is valid.   Here is some information. Monty, I would recommend that you read the books suggested so that you might gain some understanding of what you are discussing. You continue to make yourself look foolish. River out of Eden is a good, basic introduction to the main concepts of evolutionary biology.   For information on Mitochondrial Eve see What, if anything, is a Mitochondrial Eve?"
996,notsarc,"Apologies, that wasn't my intention. My meaning was this; while it was your conclusion, your use of it as an unsupported 'fact' forced us to treat it as an assumption. We had no way by which we could make it a conclusion - that's the purpose of this thread!"
997,notsarc,"It's your article, not mine"
998,notsarc,"Why not? You said yourself kalifornia was a ""trend setter"". It is alread the law in many states."
999,notsarc,"Yes, it's very subjective. I was using evil as an example that was incorrectly used on the website. Even though evil is subjective, you can still be evil. (you can do evil to take away your goodness, but the only way to make yourself colder is by removing your heat, not adding ""cold"")   No, but there is proof that it's that way, which can be seen through a combination of personal experience and the experiences of others.   The classic example about seeing that the Earth is round is that of the horizon. Why do ships appear to sink as they approach it?"
